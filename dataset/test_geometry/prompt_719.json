    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 3$, $BC = 4$, $AC = 5$, and $BD$ is the angle bisector from vertex $B$.  If $BD = k \\sqrt{2}$, then find $k$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By Pythagoras, $\\angle ABC = 90^\\circ$.  Let $P$ and $Q$ be the projections of $D$ onto $BC$ and $AB$, respectively.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, P, Q;\n\nA = (0,3);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (12/7,12/7);\nP = (12/7,0);\nQ = (0,12/7);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(B--D);\ndraw(P--D--Q);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, NE);\nlabel(\"$P$\", P, S);\nlabel(\"$Q$\", Q, W);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (D + P)/2, E);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (D + Q)/2, N);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (B + P)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (B + Q)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$4 - x$\", (C + P)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$3 - x$\", (A + Q)/2, W);\n[/asy]\n\nWe have that $\\angle ABC = 90^\\circ$ and $\\angle PBD = 45^\\circ$, so quadrilateral $BPDQ$ is a square.  Let $x$ be the side length of this square.\n\nThen $PC = BC - BP = 4 - x$, and $AQ = AB - QB = 3 - x$.  Triangles $AQD$ and $DPC$ are similar, so \\[\\frac{AQ}{QD} = \\frac{DP}{PC},\\]or \\[\\frac{3 - x}{x} = \\frac{x}{4 - x}.\\]Solving for $x$, we find $x = 12/7$.  Then $BD = x \\sqrt{2} = 12/7 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{12}{7}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The sides of triangle $CAB$ are in the ratio of $2:3:4$. Segment $BD$ is the angle bisector drawn to the shortest side, dividing it into segments $AD$ and $DC$. What is the length, in inches, of the longer subsegment of side $AC$ if the length of side $AC$ is $10$ inches? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Without loss of generality, suppose that $BA < BC$. Since $BD$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle B$, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, it follows that $$\\frac{AD}{CD} = \\frac{BA}{BC} = \\frac 34.$$ Thus, $AD < CD$, so $CD$ is the longer subsegment of $AC$. Solving for $AD$, it follows that $AD = \\frac{3CD}{4}$. Also, we know that $AD + CD = AC = 10$, and substituting our previous value for $AD$, we find that $\\frac{3CD}{4} + CD = \\frac {7CD}4 = 10 \\Longrightarrow CD = \\boxed{\\frac {40}7}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 16$, $AC = 24$, $BC = 19$, and $AD$ is an angle bisector.  Find the ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$.  (Express your answer as a fraction in lowest terms.)\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$ is $BD/CD$.  By the angle bisector theorem, $BD/CD = AB/AC = 16/24 = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the slope of the line that is tangent to a circle at point (5,5) if the center of the circle is (3,2)? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If a line can be drawn tangent to a circle a the point $(5,5)$, then it must be possible to draw a radius from the center of the circle to the point $(5,5)$.  This radius will have a slope of: $$\\frac{5-2}{5-3}=\\frac{3}{2}$$ A key fact to remember is that tangents to a circle at a certain point are perpendicular to radii drawn from the center of the circle to that point.  This diagram summarizes that fact: [asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),sqrt(13)),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((-1,5)--(5,1),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((0,0)--(2,3),linewidth(.8));\ndraw((2-0.3,3+0.2)--(2-0.5,3-0.1)--(2-0.2,3-0.3));\n[/asy] Therefore, the slope of the tangent will be the negative inverse of the slope of the radius, which is equal to $\\boxed{-\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle ABC$ be a right triangle such that $B$ is a right angle. A circle with diameter of $BC$ meets side $AC$ at $D.$ If $AD = 1$ and $BD = 4,$ then what is $CD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We might try sketching a diagram: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO, pD;\npA = (-5, 0);\npB = (0, 0);\npC = (0, 20);\npO = (0, 10);\npD = (-80/17, 20/17);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pD--pB);\ndraw(circle(pO, 10));\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, S);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", pD, NE);\n[/asy] Since $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, that makes $\\angle BDC$ a right angle. Then, by $AA$ similarity, we see that $\\triangle ADB \\sim \\triangle BDC \\sim \\triangle ABC.$ Then, $\\frac{BD}{AD} = \\frac{CD}{BD},$ so $CD = \\frac{BD^2}{AD} = \\frac{4^2}{1} = \\boxed{16}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 10$ and $AC = 17$.  Let $D$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $BC$.  If $BD:CD = 2:5$, then find $AD$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $h = AD$.  Then by Pythagoras on right triangle $ABD$, \\[BD^2 = 10^2 - h^2 = 100 - h^2,\\]and by Pythagoras on right triangle $ACD$, \\[CD^2 = 17^2 - h^2 = 289 - h^2.\\][asy]\nimport graph;\n\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D;\n\nA = (6,8);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (21,0);\nD = (6,0);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\n\nlabel(\"$10$\", (A + B)/2, NW);\nlabel(\"$17$\", (A + C)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$h$\", (A + D)/2, E);\n[/asy]\n\nBut $BD:CD = 2:5$, so $BD^2 : CD^2 = 4:25$.  Hence, \\[\\frac{100 - h^2}{289 - h^2} = \\frac{4}{25}.\\]Solving for $h$, we find $h = \\boxed{8}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 5$, $BC = 8$, and the length of median $AM$ is 4.  Find $AC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $BC = 8$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $BM = CM = 4$.  But $AM = 4$, so $M$ is the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$.  Furthermore, $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, so $\\angle BAC = 90^\\circ$.\n\n[asy]\n\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, M;\n\nA = dir(110);\n\nB = (-1,0);\n\nC = (1,0);\n\nM = (0,0);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\n\ndraw(A--M);\n\ndraw(Circle(M,1));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\n\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\n\ndot(\"$M$\", M, S);\n\n[/asy]\n\nThen by Pythagoras on right triangle $ABC$, $AC = \\sqrt{BC^2 - AB^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 - 5^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 25} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{39}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB=20$ and $AC=11$. The angle bisector of $\\angle A$ intersects $BC$ at point $D$, and point $M$ is the midpoint of $AD$. Let $P$ be the point of the intersection of $AC$ and $BM$. The ratio of $CP$ to $PA$ can be expressed in the form $\\dfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] pointpen = black; pathpen = linewidth(0.7);  pair A = (0,0), C= (11,0), B=IP(CR(A,20),CR(C,18)), D = IP(B--C,CR(B,20/31*abs(B-C))), M = (A+D)/2, P = IP(M--2*M-B, A--C), D2 = IP(D--D+P-B, A--C);  D(MP(\"A\",D(A))--MP(\"B\",D(B),N)--MP(\"C\",D(C))--cycle); D(A--MP(\"D\",D(D),NE)--MP(\"D'\",D(D2))); D(B--MP(\"P\",D(P))); D(MP(\"M\",M,NW)); MP(\"20\",(B+D)/2,ENE); MP(\"11\",(C+D)/2,ENE);  [/asy]Let $D'$ be on $\\overline{AC}$ such that $BP \\parallel DD'$. It follows that $\\triangle BPC \\sim \\triangle DD'C$, so\\[\\frac{PC}{D'C} = 1 + \\frac{BD}{DC} = 1 + \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{31}{11}\\]by the Angle Bisector Theorem. Similarly, we see by the Midline Theorem that $AP = PD'$. Thus,\\[\\frac{CP}{PA} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{PD'}{PC}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{D'C}{PC}} = \\frac{31}{20},\\]and $m+n = \\boxed{51}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $D$ lies on side $AC$ of equilateral triangle $ABC$ such that the measure of angle $DBC$ is $45$ degrees. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ADB$ to the area of triangle $CDB$? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] size(100); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); pen f = fontsize(10);\npair A=(0,0),B=(0.5,0.5*3^.5),C=(1,0),D=(1/(2+3^.5),0),E=foot(D,B,C);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(B--D--E);\n\ndraw(rightanglemark(D,E,B,2));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S,f); label(\"$B$\",B,N,f); label(\"$C$\",C,S,f); label(\"$D$\",D,S,f); label(\"$E$\",E,NE,f); label(\"$60^{\\circ}$\",C,(-1.8,1),f); label(\"$45^{\\circ}$\",B,(0.8,-6.2),f);\n[/asy] Let $s$ be the length of a side of equilateral triangle $ABC$, and let $E$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ to $\\overline{BC}$. It follows that $\\triangle BDE$ is a $45-45-90$ triangle and $\\triangle CDE$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle. It follows that $BE = DE$ and $CE = DE/\\sqrt{3}$, so $$s = BC = BE + EC = DE + DE/\\sqrt{3} = DE \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right).$$It follows that $DE = \\frac{s}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{s}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{1 + \\sqrt{3}},$ so $CE = DE/\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{s}{1+\\sqrt{3}}$ and $CD = 2CE = \\frac{2s}{1+\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nSince triangles $ADB$ and $CDB$ share the same height, it follows that the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases, namely $AD/CD$. Since $AD = s - CD$, then $$\\frac{AD}{CD}= \\frac{s}{CD} - 1 = \\frac{s}{\\frac{2s}{1+\\sqrt{3}}} - 1 = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}.$$Thus, the ratio of the area of triangle $ADB$ to the area of triangle $CDB$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}- 1}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle ABC$ be a right triangle such that $B$ is a right angle. A circle with diameter of $BC$ meets side $AC$ at $D.$ If the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $150$ and $AC = 25,$ then what is $BD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We might try sketching a diagram: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO, pD;\npA = (-15, 0);\npB = (0, 0);\npC = (0, 20);\npO = (0, 10);\npD = (-9.6, 7.2);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pD--pB);\ndraw(circle(pO, 10));\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, S);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", pD, W);\n[/asy] Since $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, that makes $\\angle BDC$ a right angle. That means that $BD$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC.$ Then, we use the area formula to find $150 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC \\cdot BD,$ where $AC = 25.$ Solving, we have $BD = \\boxed{12}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ such that $AB = BC = 5$ and $AC = 4.$ If $AD$ is an angle bisector such that $D$ is on $BC,$ then find the value of $AD^2.$ Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\nAnswer:\n",
