    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A quadrilateral in the plane has vertices $(1, 3)$, $(1, 1)$, $(2, 1)$ and $(2006, 2007)$. How many square units is the area of the quadrilateral?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The quadrilateral is shown below: [asy]\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,1)--(2,1)--(10,10.1)--(1,3)--cycle);\ndraw((1,1)--(10,10.1),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", (1,1), S);\nlabel(\"$B$\", (2,1), E);\nlabel(\"$C$\", (10,10.1), N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", (1,3), W);\n[/asy] Divide the quadrilateral into two triangles with the dashed line. We will find the area of these two triangles separately. Since $AB$ is horizontal, the area of triangle $ABC$ is half the product of the length $AB$ multiplied by the length of the vertical altitude from $C$ to line $AB$, or $\\frac{1\\cdot2006}{2}=1003$. Since $AD$ is vertical, the area of triangle $ACD$ is half the product of the length $AD$ multiplied by the length of the horizontal altitude from $C$ to line $AD$, or $\\frac{2\\cdot2005}{2}=2005$. The area of the entire quadrilateral is $1003+2005=\\boxed{3008}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of square units in the area of trapezoid ABCD with vertices A(0,0), B(0,-2), C(4,0), and D(4,6)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plot the plots and observe that the bases of the trapezoid are $AB$ and $CD$.  The area of the trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the bases times the height: $\\frac{1}{2}(AB+CD)(AC)=\\frac{1}{2}(2+6)(4)=\\boxed{16}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\npair A=(0,0), B=(0,-2), C=(4,0), D=(4,6);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\nxaxis(-3,8,Arrows(4));\nyaxis(-3,8,Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $A(1, 1), B(6, 1), C(3, 7)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that $AB$ has length 5 and is parallel to the $x$-axis. Therefore, the height of the triangle is the difference in the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$, or $7-1 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = \\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle whose vertices are at $(4, -1)$, $(10, 3)$ and $(4, 5)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$.  Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Quadrilateral $ABCD$ has right angles at $B$ and $D$, and $AC=3$. If $ABCD$ has two sides with distinct integer lengths, then what is the area of $ABCD$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Triangles $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle ADC$ are both right and share hypotenuse $AC$, which has length $3$. Thus we have $$AB^2+BC^2 = AD^2+DC^2 = 3^2 = 9.$$The only possible integer values for $AB,$ $BC,$ $AD,$ or $DC$ are $1$ and $2$. Thus we may assume that one leg of $\\triangle ABC$ has length $1$ and one leg of $\\triangle ADC$ has length $2$ (it doesn't matter if the labels $B$ and $D$ have to be swapped to make this true).\n\nIf one leg of $\\triangle ABC$ has length $1,$ then the other leg has length $\\sqrt{3^2-1^2} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. If one leg of $\\triangle ADC$ has length $2,$ then the other leg has length $\\sqrt{3^2-2^2}= \\sqrt{5}$. Thus, quadrilateral $ABCD$ is divided by its diagonal $AC$ into right triangles of area $\\frac{1\\cdot2\\sqrt 2}{2}=\\sqrt 2$ and $\\frac{2\\cdot\\sqrt 5}{2}=\\sqrt 5$. So, the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt 2+\\sqrt 5}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$, the parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths of 8 and 20 units, respectively, and the altitude is 12 units. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. What is the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ in square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$. Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has vertices at $(-3,2),(6,-2),(3,5)$. How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(200);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nreal x = 7;\npair A=(-3,2), B=(6,-2), C=(3,5);\nfill(A--C--(-3,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(B--C--(6,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(A--B--(-3,-2)--cycle,gray(0.6));\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\nxaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\nyaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(-3,2)$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$(6,-2)$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$(3,5)$\",C,N);\ndraw((-3,5)--(6,5)--(6,-2)--(-3,-2)--cycle,dotted);[/asy] We find the area of the given triangle by subtracting the sum of the areas of the three shaded triangles in the figure from the area of the rectangle formed by all four triangles.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $9(7)=63$ square units, and the sum of the areas of the shaded triangles is $$\\frac{1}{2}(6)(3)+\\frac{1}{2}(3)(7)+\\frac{1}{2}(4)(9)=37.5$$ square units.  The area of the fourth triangle is $63-37.5=\\boxed{25.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system, trapezoid $ABCD$ has vertices $A(1, -2)$, $B(1, 1)$, $C(5, 7)$ and $D(5, 1)$. What is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two bases of the trapezoids are the segments $AB$ and $CD$, and the height is the perpendicular distance between the bases, which in this case is the difference of the $x$-coordinates: $5 - 1 = 4$. Similarly, the lengths of the bases are the differences of the $y$-coordinates of their two endpoints. Using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1+ b_2)h$, the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(3+6)(4) = \\boxed{18}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Square $ABCD$ has side length $30$. Point $P$ lies inside the square so that $AP = 12$ and $BP = 26$. The centroids of $\\triangle{ABP}$, $\\triangle{BCP}$, $\\triangle{CDP}$, and $\\triangle{DAP}$ are the vertices of a convex quadrilateral. What is the area of that quadrilateral?\n[asy] unitsize(120); pair B = (0, 0), A = (0, 1), D = (1, 1), C = (1, 0), P = (1/4, 2/3); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle); dot(P); defaultpen(fontsize(10pt)); draw(A--P--B); draw(C--P--D); label(\"$A$\", A, W); label(\"$B$\", B, W); label(\"$C$\", C, E); label(\"$D$\", D, E); label(\"$P$\", P, N*1.5+E*0.5); dot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); [/asy]\n$\\textbf{(A) }100\\sqrt{2}\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }100\\sqrt{3}\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }200\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }200\\sqrt{2}\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }200\\sqrt{3}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The centroid of a triangle is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposing side. Thus, the length of any diagonal of this quadrilateral is $20$. The diagonals are also parallel to sides of the square, so they are perpendicular to each other, and so the area of the quadrilateral is $\\frac{20\\cdot20}{2} = \\boxed{200}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In rectangle $ADEH$, points $B$ and  $C$  trisect $\\overline{AD}$, and points $G$ and  $F$ trisect $\\overline{HE}$. In addition,  $AH=AC=2$. What is the area of  quadrilateral $WXYZ$ shown in the figure?\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1cm);\npair A,B,C,D,I,F,G,H,U,Z,Y,X;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(1,0);\nC=(2,0);\nD=(3,0);\nI=(3,2);\nF=(2,2);\nG=(1,2);\nH=(0,2);\nU=(1.5,1.5);\nZ=(2,1);\nY=(1.5,0.5);\nX=(1,1);\ndraw(A--D--I--H--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(H--C,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(G--D,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(I--B,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--F,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,SE);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I,NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,N);\nlabel(\"$G$\",G,N);\nlabel(\"$H$\",H,NW);\nlabel(\"$W$\",U,N);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,W);\nlabel(\"$Y$\",Y,S);\nlabel(\"$Z$\",Z,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First note that since points $B$ and  $C$  trisect $\\overline{AD}$, and points $G$ and  $F$ trisect $\\overline{HE}$, we have $HG = GF = FE = AB = BC = CD = 1$. Also,  $\\overline{HG}$ is parallel to $\\overline{CD}$ and $HG = CD$, so $CDGH$ is a parallelogram. Similarly,  $\\overline{AB}$ is parallel to $\\overline{FE}$ and $AB = FE$, so $ABEF$ is a parallelogram. As a consequence,  $WXYZ$ is a parallelogram, and since $HG = CD = AB = FE$, it  is a rhombus.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1cm);\npair A,B,C,D,I,F,G,H,U,Z,Y,X;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(1,0);\nC=(2,0);\nD=(3,0);\nI=(3,2);\nF=(2,2);\nG=(1,2);\nH=(0,2);\nU=(1.5,1.5);\nZ=(2,1);\nY=(1.5,0.5);\nX=(1,1);\ndraw(A--D--I--H--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(H--C,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(G--D,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(I--B,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--F,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,SE);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I,NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,N);\nlabel(\"$G$\",G,N);\nlabel(\"$H$\",H,NW);\nlabel(\"$W$\",U,N);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,W);\nlabel(\"$Y$\",Y,S);\nlabel(\"$Z$\",Z,E);\ndraw(F--C,linewidth(0.5));\n[/asy]\n\nSince $AH = AC = 2$, the rectangle $ACFH$ is a square of side length 2. Its diagonals $\\overline{AF}$ and $\\overline{CH}$ have length $2\\sqrt{2}$ and form a right angle at $X$. As a consequence, $WXYZ$ is a square. In isosceles $\\triangle HXF$ we have $HX = XF = \\sqrt{2}$. In addition, $HG = \\frac{1}{2}HF$. So $XW = \\frac{1}{2}XF = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{2}$, and the square $WXYZ$ has area $XW^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Given quadrilateral $ABCD$ with $A(3,7)$, $B(3,5)$, $C(-1,1)$, and $D(-1,3)$, find the number of square units in the area of the quadrilateral.\n\nAnswer:\n",
