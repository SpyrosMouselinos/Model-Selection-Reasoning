    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A spherical soap bubble lands on a horizontal wet surface and forms a hemisphere of the same volume. Given the radius of the hemisphere is $3\\sqrt[3]{2}$ cm, find the radius of the original bubble.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac43\\pi r^3$, so the volume of a hemisphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac23\\pi r^3$. Therefore if a hemisphere of radius $r$ has the same volume as a sphere of radius $R$, we get $\\frac43\\pi R^3=\\frac23 \\pi r^3$. Simplifying gives $R^3=\\frac12 r^3\\Rightarrow R=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}r$. We know that $r=3\\sqrt[3]{2}$ and that $R$ is the quantity we want to solve for, so substituting in our value of $r$ gives $R=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\cdot 3\\sqrt[3]{2}=\\boxed{3}.$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. What is the ratio of the volume of the inscribed sphere to the volume of the cube? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(60);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nLet the side length of the cube be $s$.  The side length of the cube is equal to diameter of the inscribed sphere, so the radius of the sphere has length $\\frac{s}{2}$.  Thus, the volume of the sphere is equal to $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{\\pi s^3}{6}$ and the volume of the cube is equal to $s^3$.  Hence the ratio of the sphere's volume to the cube's volume is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The diameter, in inches, of a sphere with twice the volume of a sphere of radius 9 inches can be expressed in the form $a\\sqrt[3]{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b$ contains no perfect cube factors.  Compute $a+b$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius 9 inches has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=4\\cdot 9^2 \\cdot 3\\pi$ cubic inches; twice this is $8\\cdot 9^2\\cdot 3 \\pi$ cubic inches.  Let the radius of the larger sphere be $r$, so we have \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3= 8\\cdot 9^2\\cdot 3\\pi .\\] Solving for $r$ yields \\[r^3 =2\\cdot 9^3 \\Rightarrow r = 9\\sqrt[3]{2}.\\]  The diameter is twice this value, or $18\\sqrt[3]{2}$ inches.  Hence $a=18$, $b=2$, and $a+b=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$. Including the area of its circular base, what is the total surface area of a hemisphere with radius 6 cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport markers;\nsize(150);\nimport geometry;\ndraw((0,-7)--(0,-1),Arrow);\ndraw((10,10)--(5,5),Arrow);\nlabel(\"half of sphere\",(10,10),N);\nlabel(\"circular base\",(0,-7),S);\n\ndraw(scale(1,.2)*arc((0,0),10,0,180),dashed);\ndraw(scale(1,.2)*arc((0,0),10,180,360));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),10,0,180));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The base of the hemisphere is a circle with radius 6 and area $6^2\\pi=36\\pi$.  The curved top of the hemisphere has half the surface area of a full sphere, which has surface area $4\\pi(6^2)=144\\pi$, so the curved top of the hemisphere has $144\\pi/2=72\\pi$.  The total surface area of the hemisphere is $36\\pi+72\\pi=\\boxed{108\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The radius of a sphere is $p$ units and the radius of a hemisphere is $2p$ units. What is the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the hemisphere?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi p^3\\] and the volume of the hemisphere is \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2p)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi p^3 \\cdot 4.\\] Thus the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the hemisphere is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube with edge length 9 inches. Then a smaller cube is inscribed in the sphere. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed cube? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We draw a diagram:\n\n[asy]\nsize(140);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndot((6,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nThe sphere's diameter length is equal to the big cube's side length, which is 9.\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),9));\ndraw((15,6)..(6,8)..(-3,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((15,6)..(6,4)..(-3,6));\ndot((6,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nNow the sphere's diameter is equal to the space diagonal of the small cube, meaning that the distance between two opposite corners of a cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere.  To compute the space diagonal of the cube, let the side length of the cube be $s$, and label points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ as shown below.\n\n[asy]\nsize(85);\npen dps=linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps);\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,0),SW); label(\"$C$\",(9,0),SE); label(\"$D$\",(12,3),NE); label(\"$A$\",(3,3),NW); label(\"$E$\",(12,12),E);\n[/asy] We look at triangle $\\triangle BDE$, where $\\overline{BE}$ is the space diagonal.  $\\overline{DE}$ is a side length of the cube with length $s$. $\\overline{BD}$ is the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with legs length $s$, so its length is $\\sqrt{s^2+s^2}=s\\sqrt{2}$.  So we have \\[BE=\\sqrt{DE^2+BD^2}=\\sqrt{s^2+(s\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{3s^2} = s\\sqrt{3}.\\]Thus, the space diagonal of a cube with side length $s$ has length $s\\sqrt{3}$.  The sphere has diameter 9, which is equal to the space diagonal of the cube, so we have \\[9 = s\\sqrt{3} \\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad s = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]Finally, the volume of the cube is $s^3 = \\left(\\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{81\\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A large sphere has a volume of $288\\pi$ cubic units.  A smaller sphere has a volume which is $12.5\\%$ of the volume of the larger sphere.  What is the ratio of the radius of the smaller sphere to the radius of the larger sphere? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that the two spheres are similar (in the same sense that triangles are similar) because corresponding parts are in proportion. We will prove that for two spheres that are similar in the ratio $1:k$, their volumes have the ratio $1:k^3$. Let the radius of the first sphere be $r$, so the radius of the other sphere is $kr$. The volume of the first sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the volume of the second sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (kr)^3$. The ratio between the two volumes is  \\[\\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (kr)^3}=\\frac{r^3}{k^3r^3}=\\frac{1}{k^3}\\] Thus, the ratio of the volumes of the two spheres is $1:k^3$.\n\nIn this problem, since the smaller sphere has $12.5\\%=\\frac{1}{8}$ of the volume of the larger sphere, the radius is $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{8}}=\\frac{1}{2}$ that of the larger sphere. Thus, the ratio between the two radii is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n(In general, the ratio of the volumes of two similar 3-D shapes is the cube of the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides.)\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a given sphere is $36\\pi$ cubic inches. How many square inches are in its surface area? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Here, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=36\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\\pi(3^2)=\\boxed{36\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylinder with a base radius of 3 units is inscribed in a sphere of radius 5 units. The total volume, in cubic units, of the space inside the sphere and outside the cylinder is $W\\pi$.  Find $W$, as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To begin, we need to visualize the cylinder inscribed in the sphere.  We can draw the cylinder as shown: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(6,0)--(6,8)--(0,8)--cycle,linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,8)--(6,0),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,0)..(3,-1.5)..(6,0),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,0)..(3,1.5)..(6,0),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,8)..(3,9.5)..(6,8),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,8)..(3,6.5)..(6,8),linewidth(.7));\nlabel(\"6\",(3,8),N);\nlabel(\"10\",(3,4),NE);\n[/asy] A diagonal drawn in the cylinder will have length 10, which is the diameter of the sphere.  We can see that a 6-8-10 right triangle is formed by the height of the cylinder, the diameter of the sphere, and the diameter of the base of the cylinder.  Now that we know the height of the cylinder, we have everything we need to compute the desired volume: $$V_{sphere}=\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\cdot \\pi\\cdot 5^3=\\frac{500\\pi}{3}$$$$V_{cylinder}=\\pi r^2\\cdot h=\\pi \\cdot 3^2\\cdot 8=72\\pi .$$The volume inside the sphere and outside the cylinder is the difference of the above values: $$V_{sphere}-V_{cylinder}=\\frac{500\\pi}{3}-72\\pi =\\frac{500\\pi-216\\pi}{3}=\\boxed{\\frac{284}{3}}\\pi .$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A water-filled spherical balloon lands on a sidewalk, momentarily flattening to a hemisphere.  The ratio of the radius of the spherical balloon to the radius of the hemisphere can be expressed in the form $\\sqrt[3]{a}$ for some real number $a$.  Compute $a$.\n\nAnswer:\n",
