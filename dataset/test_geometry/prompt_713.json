    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A prism has 15 edges. How many faces does the prism have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If a prism has 2 bases and $L$ lateral faces, then each base is an $L$-gon, so the two bases collectively have $2L$ edges.  Also, there are $L$ edges connecting corresponding vertices of the two bases, for a total of $3L$ edges.  Solving $3L=15$, we find that the prism has 5 lateral faces and hence $5+2=\\boxed{7}$ faces in total.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the sum of the number of faces, edges and vertices of a triangular prism?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(10,0)--(5,8.7)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(20,20),dashed);\ndraw((10,0)--(30,20));\ndraw((5,8.7)--(25,28.7));\ndraw((25,28.7)--(30,20)--(20,20)--cycle,dashed);\ndraw((25,28.7)--(30,20));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Faces: There are $3$ on the sides, a top face, and a bottom face, so $5$.\n\nEdges: There are $3$ on the top, $3$ on the bottom, and $3$ connecting them, for $9$.\n\nVertices: There are $3$ on the top and $3$ on the bottom, for $6$.\n\nSo $5+9+6=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the total area, in square units, of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid that has base edges measuring 6 units and lateral edges measuring 5 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The triangular faces are isosceles triangles.  We drop an altitude from the apex to the base, and, since the triangle is isosceles, it will also be a median.  So it forms a right triangle with hypotenuse $5$ and one leg $3$, and thus the other leg, the altitude, is $4$.  The area of the triangle is then $\\frac{4(6)}{2}=12$.  Since there are $4$ triangular faces, the total area is $4(12)=\\boxed{48}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n One of the five faces of the triangular prism shown here will be used as the base of a new pyramid. The numbers of exterior faces, vertices and edges of the resulting shape (the fusion of the prism and pyramid) are added. What is the maximum value of this sum?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(9,12)--(25,0)--cycle);\ndraw((9,12)--(12,14)--(28,2)--(25,0));\ndraw((12,14)--(3,2)--(0,0),dashed);\ndraw((3,2)--(28,2),dashed);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The original prism has 5 faces, 9 edges, and 6 vertices.  If the new pyramid is added to a triangular face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 3 new faces.  If instead the new pyramid is added to a quadrilateral face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 4 new edges, and 4 new faces.  So, we maximize the sum by adding a pyramid to a quadrilateral face.  This gives us a solid with $5-1+4 = 8$ faces, $9+4=13$ edges, and $6 + 1 = 7$ vertices.  The sum of these is $\\boxed{28}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right, rectangular prism has three faces with areas of $6,8$ and $12$ square inches. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=6$, $wh=8$, and $lh=12$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=6\\cdot8\\cdot12=3\\cdot2\\cdot2^3\\cdot2^2\\cdot3=2^6\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^3\\cdot3=\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangular prism has dimensions 8 inches by 2 inches by 32 inches. If a cube has the same volume as the prism, what is the surface area of the cube, in square inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cube has volume $8\\cdot2\\cdot32$ cubic inches, so its edge length is $\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot2\\cdot32}=\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot64}=\\sqrt[3]{8}\\sqrt[3]{64}=2\\cdot4=8$ inches.  The surface area of a cube with edge length 8 inches is $6(8\\text{ in.})^2=\\boxed{384}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The areas of three of the faces of a right, rectangular prism are $24 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2$, $32 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2$, and $48 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2$. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the three dimensions of the prism (length, width, and height, although not necessarily in that order) be $x,y,z$ such that $xy = 24$, $xz = 32$, and $yz = 48$.  Then the volume of the prism is $xyz$.  Multiplying our three equations together and taking the square root of both sides, we find that $xyz = \\sqrt{24\\cdot 32\\cdot 48} = \\boxed{192}$ cubic centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has eight vertices (corners) and twelve edges. A segment, such as $x$, which joins two vertices not joined by an edge is called a diagonal. Segment $y$ is also a diagonal. How many diagonals does a cube have? [asy]\n/* AMC8 1998 #17 Problem */\npair A=(0,48), B=(0,0), C=(48,0), D=(48,48);\npair E=(24,72), F=(24,24), G=(72,24), H=(72,72);\npen d = linetype(\"8 8\");\n\ndraw(A--D--C--B--cycle);\ndraw(D--H--G--C);\ndraw(A--E--H);\n\ndraw(B--F--E);\ndraw(F--G);\ndraw(H--A--G, d);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (40, 61), N);\nlabel(\"$y$\", (40, 35), N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are two diagonals, such as $x$, in each of the six faces for a total of twelve face diagonals. There are also four space diagonals, such as $y$, which are within the cube. This makes a total of $\\boxed{16}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular octahedron is formed by joining the centers of adjoining faces of a cube. The ratio of the volume of the octahedron to the volume of the cube is\n$\\mathrm{(A) \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(B) \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{16} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(C) \\frac{1}{6} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(D) \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{8} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(E) \\frac{1}{4} }$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Call the length of a side of the cube x. Thus, the volume of the cube is $x^3$. We can then find that a side of this regular octahedron is the square root of $(\\frac{x}{2})^2$+$(\\frac{x}{2})^2$ which is equivalent to $\\frac{x\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Using our general formula for the volume of a regular octahedron of side length a, which is $\\frac{a^3\\sqrt2}{3}$, we get that the volume of this octahedron is...\n$(\\frac{x\\sqrt{2}}{2})^3 \\rightarrow \\frac{x^3\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\rightarrow \\frac{x^3\\sqrt{2}}{4}*\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\rightarrow \\frac{2x^3}{12}=\\frac{x^3}{6}$\nComparing the ratio of the volume of the octahedron to the cube is\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\n$\\frac{\\frac{x^3}{6}}{x^3} \\rightarrow \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many edges does an octagonal prism have?\n\nAnswer:\n",
