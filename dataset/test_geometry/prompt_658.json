    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a given sphere is $36\\pi$ cubic inches. How many square inches are in its surface area? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Here, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=36\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\\pi(3^2)=\\boxed{36\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The surface area of a particular sphere is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is cut into four congruent wedges. The circumference of the sphere is $12\\pi$ inches. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one wedge? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the sphere.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sphere's radius be $r$.  From the sphere's circumference we have $2\\pi r = 12\\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r = 6$.  The volume of the sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6^3) = 36\\cdot 8 \\pi$.  The volume of one wedge is one-fourth this volume, or $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 6^2\\cdot 8 \\pi = 6^2\\cdot 2\\pi = \\boxed{72\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$. Including the area of its circular base, what is the total surface area of a hemisphere with radius 6 cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport markers;\nsize(150);\nimport geometry;\ndraw((0,-7)--(0,-1),Arrow);\ndraw((10,10)--(5,5),Arrow);\nlabel(\"half of sphere\",(10,10),N);\nlabel(\"circular base\",(0,-7),S);\n\ndraw(scale(1,.2)*arc((0,0),10,0,180),dashed);\ndraw(scale(1,.2)*arc((0,0),10,180,360));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),10,0,180));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The base of the hemisphere is a circle with radius 6 and area $6^2\\pi=36\\pi$.  The curved top of the hemisphere has half the surface area of a full sphere, which has surface area $4\\pi(6^2)=144\\pi$, so the curved top of the hemisphere has $144\\pi/2=72\\pi$.  The total surface area of the hemisphere is $36\\pi+72\\pi=\\boxed{108\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of the base of a hemisphere is $100\\pi$. What is the total surface area of the hemisphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the hemisphere's radius be $r$.  The hemisphere's base is a circle with radius $r$; thus, we have $\\pi r^2 = 100\\pi$.  Taking the positive solution for $r$ yields $r = 10$.  The surface area of the curved part of the hemisphere is half the surface area of a sphere with radius 10, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4\\pi (10^2) = 200\\pi$.  The total surface area of the hemisphere is the sum of this curved surface area and the base area, which is $200\\pi+100\\pi=\\boxed{300\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is circumscribed about an equilateral triangle with side lengths of $9$ units each.  What is the area of the circle, in square units? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8));\ndraw((0,0)--(4.5,7.794)--(9,0)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((4.5,2.598),5.196));\ndraw((4.5,7.794)--(4.5,0));\ndot((4.5,2.598));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(4.5,2.598),W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(4.5,7.794),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(9,0),E);\nlabel(\"$M$\",(4.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\n\nAbove is the diagram implied by the problem, with some added lines ($O$ is the center of the circle). Since $\\triangle AMB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and $AB=9$, $AM=4.5\\sqrt{3}$. Since $AO$ is $2/3$ of $AM$, $AO=3\\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the area of the circle is $\\pi(3\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{27\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The number of inches in the perimeter of an equilateral triangle equals the number of square inches in the area of its circumscribed circle. What is the radius, in inches, of the circle? Express your answer in terms of pi and in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the triangle have vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, let $O$ be the center of the circle, and let $D$ be the midpoint of $\n\\overline{BC}$. Triangle $COD$ is a $30 - 60 - 90$ degree triangle. If $r$ is the radius of the circle, then the sides of $\\triangle COD$ are $r$, $\\frac{r}{2}$, and $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $6\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\displaystyle\\right)=3r\\sqrt{3}$, and the area of the circle is $\\pi r^{2}$. Thus $3r\\sqrt{3} = \\pi r^{2}$, and $r =\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{\\pi}}$.\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,D,O;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(0,1);\nB=(0.87,-0.5);\nC=(-0.87,-0.5);\nD=(0,-0.5);\ndraw(Circle(O,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(C--O--D--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$\\frac{r}{2}$\",(0,-0.25),E);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}$\",(-0.43,-0.5),S);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-0.43,-0.25),NW);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,N);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A certain circle's area is $x$ square units, and its circumference is $y$ units. The value of $x + y$ is $80\\pi$. What is the radius of the circle, in units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $r$ is the radius of the circle, we know that $x = \\pi r^2$ and $y = 2\\pi r$. Thus, we have \\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 80\\pi\\\\\n\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r &= 80\\pi\\\\\nr(r + 2) &= 80.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe want to find two integers whose product is 80, such that one integer is two more than the other. We note that 80 can be factored as $8\\cdot 10$. Therefore, $r = \\boxed{8}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. Given that one edge of the cube is 6 inches, how many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(70);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy] A sphere inscribed in a cube has diameter length equal to the side length of the cube.  Thus, the inscribed sphere has diameter 6 inches, radius $6/2=3$ inches, and volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3)^3=4\\cdot 3^2\\pi=\\boxed{36\\pi}\\] cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many inches are in the circumference of a great circle of a sphere which has surface area of $196\\pi$ sq in?
