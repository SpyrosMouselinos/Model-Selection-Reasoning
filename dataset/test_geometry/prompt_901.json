    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Billy is hiking in Colorado. He walks eastward four miles, then turns $60$ degrees northward and walks six miles. How far is he from his starting point? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Suppose Billy starts at point $A$, turns at point $B$, and ends at point $D$, as shown below. If Billy turns $60^{\\circ}$ northward and walks six miles, then we can draw a $30-60-90$ triangle whose hypotenuse is $6$ miles (triangle $BCD$ below).\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\n\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7) + fontsize(10));\npair A,B,C,D;\nA = (0,0);\nB=(4,0);\nC =(7,0);\nD = (7,3*sqrt(3));\ndraw (A--B--D--A);\ndraw(B--C--D,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$4$\",B/2,S);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(B+D)/2,NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\n[/asy]\nIt follows that Billy traveled $6/2 = 3$ miles eastward during these $6$ miles, and that he traveled $3 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}$ miles northward during these $6$ miles. In total, Billy traveled $4 + 3 = 7$ miles eastward and $3\\sqrt{3}$ miles northward. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from his starting point is $\\sqrt{(7)^2 + (3\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 27} = \\sqrt{76} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{19}}.$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A fly is on the edge of a ceiling of a circular room with a radius of 58 feet. The fly walks straight across the ceiling to the opposite edge, passing through the center of the circle. It then walks straight to another point on the edge of the circle but not back through the center. The third part of the journey is straight back to the original starting point. If the third part of the journey was 80 feet long, how many total feet did the fly travel over the course of all three parts?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The fly's journey traces out the three sides of triangle.  Because one side of this triangle is a diameter of the circular ceiling and the other two sides are chords of this circle, the triangle is a right triangle. If the radius of the circular room is 58 feet, then the diameter is $2 \\times 58 = 116$ feet. This is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. One of the legs is 80 feet, so the other leg must be equal to $\\sqrt{116^2 - 80^2} = \\sqrt{(13{,}456 - 6400)} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84$ feet. The total distance traveled by the fly is $116 + 84 + 80 = \\boxed{280}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A park is in the shape of a regular hexagon $2$ km on a side. Starting at a corner, Alice walks along the perimeter of the park for a distance of $5$ km. How many kilometers is she from her starting point?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\sqrt{13}\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{14}\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ \\sqrt{15}\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\sqrt{16}\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\sqrt{17}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We imagine this problem on a coordinate plane and let Alice's starting position be the origin. We see that she will travel along two edges and then go halfway along a third. Therefore, her new $x$-coordinate will be $1 + 2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$ because she travels along a distance of $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1$ km because of the side relationships of an equilateral triangle, then $2$ km because the line is parallel to the $x$-axis, and the remaining distance is $\\frac{1}{2}$ km because she went halfway along and because of the logic for the first part of her route. For her $y$-coordinate, we can use similar logic to find that the coordinate is $\\sqrt{3} + 0 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} =  \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, her distance is\\[\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{49}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{52}{4}} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Brad has a cylindrical barrel with radius 10 inches and height 15 inches.  He wants to fill it from a well, using a bucket in the shape of a hemisphere with a radius of 10 inches. How many trips must Brad make to the well in order to fill the barrel?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We start by finding the volume of the bucket and the volume of the barrel.  Let $r$ be ten inches.   The bucket is half of a sphere of radius $r$, so the volume it can hold is \\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3 . \\]On the other hand, the barrel is a cylinder of radius $r$ and height $15 \\text{ in} = \\frac{3}{2} r$, so its volume is \\[ \\pi r^2 \\cdot \\text{height} = \\frac{3}{2} \\pi r^3 . \\]Therefore the ratio of the volume of the barrel to the volume of the bucket is \\[ \\frac{(3/2) \\pi r^3}{(2/3) \\pi r^3} = \\frac{9}{4}\n= 2 + \\frac{1}{4} . \\]Thus two buckets will not suffice to fill the barrel, but three will, so Brad needs $\\boxed{3}$ trips to the well.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Isosceles triangle $ABE$ of area 100 square inches is cut by $\\overline{CD}$ into an isosceles trapezoid and a smaller isosceles triangle. The area of the trapezoid is 75 square inches. If the altitude of triangle $ABE$ from $A$ is 20 inches, what is the number of inches in the length of $\\overline{CD}$?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((-9,0)--(0,24)--(9,0)--cycle);\ndraw((-6,8)--(6,8));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,24),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(-9,0),W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-6,8),NW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(6,8),NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(9,0),E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The area of triangle $ABE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(BE)(20\\text{ in.})$. Setting this equal to $100$ square inches we find $BE=10$ inches.  The area of triangle $ACD$ is $100-75=25$ square inches.  Since triangle $ACD$ is similar to triangle $ABE$ and the ratio of their areas is $\\frac{1}{4}$, the ratio of corresponding side lengths is $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, $CD=\\frac{1}{2}BE=\\boxed{5}$ inches.\n\nAlternatively, because triangles $ACD$ and $ABE$ are similar, the height-to-base ratio is the same for each of them.  In triangle $ABE$, this ratio is $\\frac{20\\text{ in.}}{10\\text{ in.}}=2$.  Therefore, the height of $ACD$ is $2\\cdot CD$.  Solving $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\cdot CD)(CD)=25\\text{ in.}^2$ we find $CD=5$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $ABCD$ be an isosceles trapezoid with $\\overline{AD}||\\overline{BC}$ whose angle at the longer base $\\overline{AD}$ is $\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$. The diagonals have length $10\\sqrt {21}$, and point $E$ is at distances $10\\sqrt {7}$ and $30\\sqrt {7}$ from vertices $A$ and $D$, respectively. Let $F$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$ to $\\overline{AD}$. The distance $EF$ can be expressed in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] size(300); defaultpen(1); pair A=(0,0), D=(4,0), B= A+2 expi(1/3*pi), C= D+2expi(2/3*pi), E=(-4/3,0), F=(3,0); draw(F--C--B--A); draw(E--A--D--C); draw(A--C,dashed); draw(circle(A,abs(C-A)),dotted); label(\"\\(A\\)\",A,S); label(\"\\(B\\)\",B,NW); label(\"\\(C\\)\",C,NE); label(\"\\(D\\)\",D,SE); label(\"\\(E\\)\",E,N); label(\"\\(F\\)\",F,S); clip(currentpicture,(-1.5,-1)--(5,-1)--(5,3)--(-1.5,3)--cycle); [/asy]\nAssuming that $ADE$ is a triangle and applying the triangle inequality, we see that $AD > 20\\sqrt {7}$. However, if $AD$ is strictly greater than $20\\sqrt {7}$, then the circle with radius $10\\sqrt {21}$ and center $A$ does not touch $DC$, which implies that $AC > 10\\sqrt {21}$, a contradiction. As a result, A, D, and E are collinear. Therefore, $AD = 20\\sqrt {7}$.\nThus, $ADC$ and $ACF$ are $30-60-90$ triangles. Hence $AF = 15\\sqrt {7}$, and\n$EF = EA + AF = 10\\sqrt {7} + 15\\sqrt {7} = 25\\sqrt {7}$\nFinally, the answer is $25+7=\\boxed{32}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A spiral staircase turns $270^\\circ$ as it rises 10 feet.  The radius of the staircase is 3 feet.  What is the number of feet in the length of the handrail?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The handrail encases a right circular cylinder with radius 3 feet and height 10 feet.  Its lateral area is a rectangle with height 10 feet and width equal to its base circumference, or $2\\pi\\cdot 3 = 6\\pi$ feet.  A staircase that turns $360^\\circ$ would, when unrolled and lain flat, span the diagonal of this rectangle.  However, our staircase does not make a full turn, so it spans a rectangle with a shorter width.\n\nA $270^\\circ$ sector of a circle with radius 3 has arc length $\\frac{270^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\cdot 2\\pi\\cdot 3 = 4.5\\pi$.  Thus, when unrolled and lain flat, our handrail spans the diagonal of a rectangle with height 10 feet and width $4.5\\pi$ feet.  Our handrail has length $\\sqrt{10^2+(4.5\\pi)^2} \\approx 17.317$ feet.  To the nearest tenth, this value is $\\boxed{17.3}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Six boys stood equally spaced on a circle of radius 40 feet. Each boy walked to all of the other non-adjacent persons on the circle, shook their hands and then returned to his original spot on the circle before the next boy started his trip to shake hands with all of the other non-adjacent boys on the circle. After all six boys had done this, what is the least distance in feet that could have been traveled? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The thicker solid line in the diagram shows the shortest path that one person could travel. The circle is equally divided into six 60-degree arcs, so the short distance is 40 feet, the same as a radius. The dotted line is a diameter that separates the quadrilateral into two 30-60-90 triangles. The longer leg is $(80\\sqrt {3})/2$, or $40\\sqrt{3}$ feet. Each person travels $40\\sqrt{3} + 40 + 40 + 40\\sqrt{3} = 80 + 80\\sqrt{3}$ feet. After all six people did this, $6(80 + 80\\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{480 + 480\\sqrt{3}\\text{ feet}}$ had been traveled.

The sidewalk is 20 feet long and 2 feet wide. If the snow is $\\frac{1}{2}$ foot deep, how many cubic feet of snow does Khali have to shovel off the sidewalk?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The snow on Khalil's sidewalk is in the shape of a rectangular prism whose dimensions are 20 feet by 2 feet by $\\frac{1}{2}$ feet.  The volume of such a rectangular prism is $(20\\text{ ft.})(2\\text{ ft.})\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\text{ ft.}\\right)=\\boxed{20}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $ABC$, $AB=10$, $AC=6$ and $BC=8$ units.  What is the distance from $C$ to the midpoint of segment $AB$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse.  Therefore, the desired distance is $10/2 = \\boxed{5}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n From his base camp at the equator, Bruce hiked on flat terrain $13$ kilometers due north, then $24$ km due east, and finally $6$ km due south.
