    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has sides of length 5, 12 and 13 units, and triangle $DEF$ has sides of length 8, 15 and 17 units. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $DEF$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are both right, since their sides form Pythagorean triples. It follows that the desired ratio is $\\dfrac{(5\\cdot 12)/2}{(8\\cdot 15)/2} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and a point $K$ on $BC$ such that $AK$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$. If $AC = 10,$ $BK = 7$, and $BC = 13,$ then what is the area of $\\triangle ABC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we sketch! [asy]\npair A, B, C, K;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-7, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nK = (0, 0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--K);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$K$\", K, NE);\nlabel(\"10\", C--A, NE);\nlabel(\"7\", B--K, N);\nlabel(\"13\", B--C, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,K,B,10));\n[/asy] We now see that $CK = BC - BK = 6.$ That means $\\triangle AKC$ is a $3:4:5$ right triangle, so $AK = 8.$ At this point, we can see that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AK \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{52}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two sides of an isosceles triangle are 10 inches and 20 inches. If the shortest side of a similar triangle is 50 inches, what is the perimeter of the larger triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First of all, the third side of the smaller triangle cannot be 10 inches because sides of 10, 10 and 20 inches would not form a triangle. The smaller triangle must have sides of 10, 20 and 20 inches. If the shortest side of the similar triangle is 50 inches, then the other two sides are 100 inches and 100 inches. Thus, the perimeter of the larger triangle is $50 + 100 + 100 = \\boxed{250\\text{ inches}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the area of a triangle with side lengths 8, 9, and 9.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We draw the longest altitude of this triangle, which breaks the triangle into two right triangles.   [asy]\nsize(100);\npair A,B,C,D;\nA=(0,0); B=(8,0); C=(4,sqrt(65)); D=(4,0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(C--D);\ndraw(rightanglemark(C,D,A,18));\nlabel(\"8\",D,S); label(\"9\",(A+C)/2,W); label(\"9\",(B+C)/2,E);\n[/asy] The right triangles are congruent because the original triangle is isosceles; each right triangle has one leg length $8/2=4$ and hypotenuse length 9.  The other leg, which is also the height of the original triangle, has length $\\sqrt{9^2-4^2}=\\sqrt{65}$.  Thus, the original triangle has base length 8, height $\\sqrt{65}$, and area \\[\\frac{1}{2}(8)(\\sqrt{65})=\\boxed{4\\sqrt{65}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangle measures 6 meters by 10 meters. Drawn on each side of the rectangle is a semicircle that has the endpoints of its diameter on the vertices of the rectangle. What percent larger is the area of the large semicircles than the area of the small semicircles? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two large semicircles together make a circle of radius 5, which has area $25\\pi$.  The two small circles together make a circle with radius 3, which has area $9\\pi$.  Therefore, the ratio of the large semicircles' area to the small semicircles' area is $\\frac{25\\pi}{9\\pi} = \\frac{25}{9} \\approx 2.78$.    Since the large semicircles have area 2.78 times the small semicircles, the large semicircles' area is $278\\%$ of the small semicircles' area, which is an increase of $278\\% - 100\\% = \\boxed{178\\%}$ over the small semicircles' area.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The dimensions of a triangle are tripled to form a new triangle. If the area of the new triangle is 54 square feet, how many square feet were in the area of the original triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If two similar triangles have side ratios of $r : 1,$ the ratio of their areas must be $r^2 : 1.$ That means that when a triangle is tripled to form a new triangle, the new triangle has 9 times the area of the original. That means the original triangle must have an area of $\\dfrac{54\\text{ ft}^2}{9} = \\boxed{6}\\text{ ft}^2.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ is inscribed in triangle $EFG$ such that side $AD$ of the rectangle is on side $EG$ of the triangle, as shown. The triangle's altitude from $F$ to side $EG$ is 7 inches, and $EG = 10 \\text{ inches}$. The length of segment $AB$ is equal to half the length of segment $AD$. What is the area of rectangle $ABCD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nimport math;\nsize(101);\nreal x = 35/12;\ncurrentpen = linewidth(1)+fontsize(10pt);\npair E1 = (0,0), G = (10,0), F = (3,7), A = (3*x/7,0), D = G - (7*x/7,0), B = extension(E1,F,A,A+(0,1)), C = extension(G,F,D,D+(0,1));\ndraw(E1--F--G--cycle); draw(A--B--C--D); label(\"$A$\",A,S); label(\"$B$\",B,NW); label(\"$C$\",C,NE); label(\"$D$\",D,S); label(\"$E$\",E1,W); label(\"$F$\",F,NNW); label(\"$G$\",G,ESE);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Suppose that the altitude from $F$ to $EG$ intersects $EG$ at point $H$.  Then $\\triangle EAB \\sim \\triangle EHF$, and we have that $\\frac{HE}{HF} = \\frac{AE}{AB}$.  Also, $\\triangle GDC \\sim GHF$, and $\\frac{HG}{HF} = \\frac{DG}{DC}$.  Adding these equalities, we find that $\\frac{HE + HG}{HF} = \\frac{AE + DG}{AB}$, since $AB = DC$.  But $HE + HG = EG = 10$, $HF = 7$, and finally $AE + DG = EG - AD = 10 - 2AB$.  Plugging in, we find that $\\frac{10}{7} = \\frac{10-2AB}{AB}$, or $AB = \\frac{35}{12}$.  Thus the area of $ABCD$ is $\\frac{35}{12}\\cdot\\frac{35}{6} =\\boxed{ \\frac{1225}{72}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 7$, $AC = 15$, and the length of median $AM$ is 10.  Find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Extend $AM$ to $D$ so that $MD = MA$.  Then triangles $AMB$ and $DMC$ are congruent, so triangles $ABC$ and $ACD$ have equal area.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, M;\n\nA = (-7/sqrt(37),42/sqrt(37));\nB = (0,0);\nC = (2*sqrt(37),0);\nM = (B + C)/2;\nD = 2*M - A;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D--C);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$7$\", (A + B)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$15$\", (A + C)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (A + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (D + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$7$\", (C + D)/2, E);\n[/asy]\n\nThe semi-perimeter of triangle $ACD$ is $(7 + 15 + 20)/2 = 21$, so by Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ACD$ is $$\\sqrt{21 (21 - 7)(21 - 15)(21 - 20)} = \\boxed{42}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let triangle $ABC$ be a right triangle in the xy-plane with a right angle at $C$. Given that the length of the hypotenuse $AB$ is $60$, and that the medians through $A$ and $B$ lie along the lines $y=x+3$ and $y=2x+4$ respectively, find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Translate so the medians are $y = x$, and $y = 2x$, then model the points $A: (a,a)$ and $B: (b,2b)$. $(0,0)$ is the centroid, and is the average of the vertices, so $C: (- a - b, - a - 2b)$\n$AB = 60$ so\n$3600 = (a - b)^2 + (2b - a)^2$\n$3600 = 2a^2 + 5b^2 - 6ab \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)$\n$AC$ and $BC$ are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is $-1$, giving\n$\\left(\\frac {2a + 2b}{2a + b}\\right)\\left(\\frac {a + 4b}{a + 2b}\\right) = - 1$\n$2a^2 + 5b^2 = - \\frac {15}{2}ab \\ \\ \\ \\  (2)$\nCombining $(1)$ and $(2)$, we get $ab = - \\frac {800}{3}$\nUsing the determinant product for area of a triangle (this simplifies nicely, add columns 1 and 2, add rows 2 and 3), the area is $\\left|\\frac {3}{2}ab\\right|$, so we get the answer to be $\\boxed{400}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices at $A(5,8)$, $B(3,-2)$, and $C(6,1)$. The point $D$ with coordinates $(m,n)$ is chosen inside the triangle so that the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$ and $BCD$ all have equal areas. What is the value of $10m + n$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, then $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ would all have equal areas (to see this, remember that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into 6 equal areas). There is only one point with this property (if we move around $D$, the area of one of the small triangles will increase and will no longer be $1/3$ of the total area). So $D$ must be the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the centroid are found by averaging the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the vertices, so $(m,n) = \\left( \\frac{5+3+6}{3}, \\frac{8+(-2)+1}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$, and $10m + n = 10 \\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) + \\frac{7}{3} = \\boxed{49}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $\\triangle ABC$ has side lengths 6, 8 and 10, as shown.  Each of the side lengths of $\\triangle ABC$ is increased by $50\\%$, forming a new triangle, $\\triangle DEF$.  What is the area of $\\triangle DEF?$\n\nAnswer:\n",
