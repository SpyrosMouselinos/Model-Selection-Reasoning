    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the total area, in square units, of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid that has base edges measuring 6 units and lateral edges measuring 5 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The triangular faces are isosceles triangles.  We drop an altitude from the apex to the base, and, since the triangle is isosceles, it will also be a median.  So it forms a right triangle with hypotenuse $5$ and one leg $3$, and thus the other leg, the altitude, is $4$.  The area of the triangle is then $\\frac{4(6)}{2}=12$.  Since there are $4$ triangular faces, the total area is $4(12)=\\boxed{48}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid is formed on a $6\\times 8$ rectangular base. The four edges joining the apex to the corners of the rectangular base each have length $13$. What is the volume of the pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know the rectangular base of the pyramid has area $48$. To find the volume, we must also determine the height.\n\nLet the rectangular base be $ABCD$. Let the apex of the pyramid be $X$, and let $O$ be the foot of the perpendicular drawn from $X$ to face $ABCD$: [asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport three;\ntriple A = (-3,-4,0);\ntriple B = (-3,4,0);\ntriple C = (3,4,0);\ntriple D = (3,-4,0);\ntriple O = (0,0,0);\ntriple X = (0,0,12);\ndraw(B--C--D--A--B--X--D);\ndraw(X--C); draw(A--X--O--D,dashed);\ndot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(O); dot(X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,W);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,ESE);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,N);\ndraw(O+(X-O)/19.2--O+(X-O)/19.2+(D-O)/8--O+(D-O)/8);\n[/asy] Then by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\begin{align*}\n13^2 &= OX^2+OA^2 = OX^2+OB^2 \\\\\n&= OX^2+OC^2 = OX^2+OD^2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $OA=OB=OC=OD$, so $O$ must be the center of the rectangle (where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet). This is also the point where the diagonals of $ABCD$ bisect each other. Each diagonal of $ABCD$ has length $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$, so we have $OA=OB=OC=OD=5$.\n\nThus $OX=\\sqrt{13^2-OD^2} = \\sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$, and so the height of the pyramid is $12$. The volume is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac 13\\cdot (\\text{area of base})\\cdot (\\text{height}) &= \\frac 13\\cdot 48\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= 16\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{192}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base that measures 10 cm on each side. Its peak is 12 cm above the center of its base. What is the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"12\",(6.5,5),E);\n\ndraw((6.6,15)..(6.7,14.9)..(6.8,14.7)--(6.8,5.3)..(6.9,5.2)..(7,5)..(6.9,4.8)..(6.8,4.7)--(6.8,1.8)..(6.7,1.6)..(6.6,1.5),linewidth(.7));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To start, we can draw in a line from where the altitude meets the base to one of the bottom corners as shown:\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,1.5)--(10,0),linewidth(.7));\n[/asy]\n\nThe length of this segment will be half the length of the diagonal of the base.  The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n One of the five faces of the triangular prism shown here will be used as the base of a new pyramid. The numbers of exterior faces, vertices and edges of the resulting shape (the fusion of the prism and pyramid) are added. What is the maximum value of this sum?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(9,12)--(25,0)--cycle);\ndraw((9,12)--(12,14)--(28,2)--(25,0));\ndraw((12,14)--(3,2)--(0,0),dashed);\ndraw((3,2)--(28,2),dashed);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The original prism has 5 faces, 9 edges, and 6 vertices.  If the new pyramid is added to a triangular face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 3 new faces.  If instead the new pyramid is added to a quadrilateral face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 4 new edges, and 4 new faces.  So, we maximize the sum by adding a pyramid to a quadrilateral face.  This gives us a solid with $5-1+4 = 8$ faces, $9+4=13$ edges, and $6 + 1 = 7$ vertices.  The sum of these is $\\boxed{28}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A prism has 15 edges. How many faces does the prism have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If a prism has 2 bases and $L$ lateral faces, then each base is an $L$-gon, so the two bases collectively have $2L$ edges.  Also, there are $L$ edges connecting corresponding vertices of the two bases, for a total of $3L$ edges.  Solving $3L=15$, we find that the prism has 5 lateral faces and hence $5+2=\\boxed{7}$ faces in total.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The six edges of a tetrahedron $ABCD$ measure $7, 13, 18, 27, 36$ and $41$ units. If the length of edge $AB$ is $41$, then the length of edge $CD$ is\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 7\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 13\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 18\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 27\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 36$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the triangle inequality in $\\triangle ABC$, we find that $BC$ and $CA$ must sum to greater than $41$, so they must be (in some order) $7$ and $36$, $13$ and $36$, $18$ and $27$, $18$ and $36$, or $27$ and $36$. We try $7$ and $36$, and now by the triangle inequality in $\\triangle ABD$, we must use the remaining numbers $13$, $18$, and $27$ to get a sum greater than $41$, so the only possibility is $18$ and $27$. This works as we can put $BC = 36$, $AC = 7$, $AD = 18$, $BD = 27$, $CD = 13$, so that $\\triangle ADC$ and $\\triangle BDC$ also satisfy the triangle inequality. Hence we have found a solution that works, and it can be verified that the other possibilities don't work, though as this is a multiple-choice competition, you probably wouldn't do that in order to save time. In any case, the answer is $CD = \\boxed{13}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A convex polyhedron $P$ has $26$ vertices, $60$ edges, and $36$ faces, $24$ of which are triangular and $12$ of which are quadrilaterals. A space diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices that do not belong to the same face. How many space diagonals does $P$ have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Every pair of vertices of the polyhedron determines either an edge, a face diagonal or a space diagonal. We have ${26 \\choose 2} = \\frac{26\\cdot25}2 = 325$ total line segments determined by the vertices. Of these, $60$ are edges. Each triangular face has $0$ face diagonals and each quadrilateral face has $2$, so there are $2 \\cdot 12 = 24$ face diagonals. This leaves $325 - 60 - 24 = \\boxed{241}$ segments to be the space diagonals.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A wooden model of a square pyramid has a base edge of 12 cm and an altitude of 8 cm. A cut is made parallel to the base of the pyramid that separates it into two pieces: a smaller pyramid and a frustum. Each base edge of the smaller pyramid is 6 cm and its altitude is 4 cm. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of the frustum?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid.  The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/2, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$ of the volume of the original pyramid.  Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/8) = {7/8}$ of the original pyramid.\n\nThe original pyramid has base area $12^2 = 144$ square cm, so its volume is $144\\cdot 8/3 = 48\\cdot 8$ cubic centimeters.  Therefore, the frustum has volume \\[\\frac{7}{8}\\cdot (48\\cdot 8) = 48\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{336}\\text{ cubic centimeters}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base with perimeter 24 inches. Its apex is 9 inches from each of the other vertices. What is the height of the pyramid from its peak to the center of its square base, in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\ndraw(P--C);\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\ndraw(P--F--B,dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base.  Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFB$ is a right triangle.  The perimeter of the base of the pyramid is 24 inches, so the length of each side of the base is $6$ inches.  Since $F$ is the center of the base, $FB$ is half the diagonal of the base, or $(6\\sqrt{2})/2 = 3\\sqrt{2}$ inches.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $PFB$ gives  \\[PF = \\sqrt{PB^2 - FB^2} = \\sqrt{81 - 18} = \\sqrt{63} = \\boxed{3\\sqrt{7}} \\text{ inches}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid has 6 vertices and 6 faces. How many edges does it have?\n\nAnswer:\n",
