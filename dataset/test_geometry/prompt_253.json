    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two cylindrical cans have the same volume. The height of one can is triple the height of the other. If the radius of the narrower can is 12 units, how many units are in the length of the radius of the wider can? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the wide can be $h$ and the height of the narrow can be $3h$.  Let the wide can have radius $x$ units.  Since the two volumes are equal, we have \\[\\pi (12^2) (3h) = \\pi (x^2) (h).\\] Solving yields $x = 12\\sqrt{3}$ so the wide can has radius $\\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A bowling ball cannot weigh more than 16 pounds and must have a diameter of $8 \\frac{1}{2}$ inches. How many square inches are in the surface area of a bowling ball before the finger holes are drilled? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is \\[4\\pi r^2.\\]  The sphere in question has diameter $8\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{17}{2}$, radius $\\frac{17}{4}$, and surface area  \\[4\\pi\\left(\\frac{17}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{17^2}{4}\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{289\\pi}{4}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A whole block of modeling clay is a right rectangular prism six inches by two inches by one inch. How many whole blocks need to be unwrapped to mold a cylindrical sculpture seven inches high and four inches in diameter?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylindrical sculpture has radius two inches and uses $\\pi(2^2)(7)=28\\pi \\approx 87.96$ cubic inches of modeling clay.  Each block contains $(6)(2)(1)=12$ cubic inches of modeling clay.  If we have 7 blocks, then we have 84 cubic inches of clay which is not enough, so we need $\\boxed{8}$ blocks of clay, and we see 96 cubic inches are indeed enough.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot is filled full with chocolate.  All of the chocolate is then evenly distributed between 27 congruent, smaller hemisphere-shaped molds.  What is the radius of each of the smaller molds, in feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.  The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1^3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ cubic feet.\n\nLet each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$.  Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \\[27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n For his birthday, Bert gets a box that holds $125$ jellybeans when filled to capacity. A few weeks later, Carrie gets a larger box full of jellybeans. Her box is twice as high, twice as wide and twice as long as Bert's. Approximately, how many jellybeans did Carrie get?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the exact dimensions of Bert's box do not matter, assume the box is $1 \\times 2 \\times 3$.  Its volume is 6.  Carrie's box is $2 \\times 4 \\times 6$, so its volume is 48 or 8 times the volume of Bert's box.  Carrie has approximately $8(125) = \\boxed{1000}$ jellybeans.\n$\\textbf{Note:}$ Other examples may help to see that the ratio is always 8 to 1.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circular cylindrical post with a circumference of 4 feet has a string wrapped around it, spiraling from the bottom of the post to the top of the post. The string evenly loops around the post exactly four full times, starting at the bottom edge and finishing at the top edge. The height of the post is 12 feet. What is the length, in feet, of the string?\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,20)..(1,19.5)..(2,20)--(2,0)..(1,-.5)..(0,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,20)..(1,20.5)..(2,20),linewidth(1));\ndraw((1,19.5)--(0,18.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((2,.5)--(1,-.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((2,16)--(0,14),linewidth(1));\ndraw((2,11)--(0,9),linewidth(1));\n\ndraw((2,6)--(0,4),linewidth(1));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each time the string spirals around the post, it travels 3 feet up and 4 feet around the post.  If we were to unroll this path, it would look like: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,3)--(4,3)--(4,0)--cycle, linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(4,3),linewidth(.7));\nlabel(\"3\",(0,1.5),W);\nlabel(\"4\",(2,3),N);\n[/asy] Clearly, a 3-4-5 right triangle has been formed.  For each time around the post, the string has length 5.  So, the total length of the string will be $4\\cdot 5=\\boxed{20}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A bowling ball is a solid ball with a spherical surface and diameter 30 cm. To custom fit a bowling ball for each bowler, three holes are drilled in the ball. Bowler Kris has holes drilled that are 8 cm deep and have diameters of 2 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm. Assuming the three holes are right circular cylinders, find the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the fitted bowling ball. Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The untampered bowling ball has radius $30/2=15$ cm and volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(15^3)=4\\cdot 15^2\\cdot 5\\pi=225\\cdot 20\\pi = 4500\\pi\\] cubic cm.  The 2 cm cylindrical holes each have radius $2/2=1$ cm and volume \\[\\pi (1^2)(8)=8\\pi\\] cubic cm; the 3 cm cylindrical hole has radius $3/2$ cm and volume \\[\\pi\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2(8)=9\\cdot 2 \\pi = 18\\pi\\] cubic cm.  Post hole-removal the fitted ball has volume \\[4500\\pi - 2\\cdot 8\\pi - 18\\pi = \\boxed{4466\\pi}\\] cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two circles are drawn in a 12-inch by 14-inch rectangle. Each circle has a diameter of 6 inches. If the circles do not extend beyond the rectangular region, what is the greatest possible distance (in inches) between the centers of the two circles?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Suppose we put the two circles in opposite corners of the rectangle so that the circles are tangent to the sides of the rectangle, and they are diagonally across from each other. Then the center of each circle is 3 inches in from each side of the rectangle that it touches. Now imagine a rectangle that has opposite corners at the centers of these circles. This smaller rectangle measures 8 inches by 6 inches. The diagonal of this rectangle is the greatest possible distance between the centers of the two circles. It helps if we recognize that these lengths are $3 \\times 2$ and $4 \\times 2$, which means we have a multiple of the 3-4-5 Pythagorean Triple. Thus, the length of the diagonal must be $5 \\times 2 = \\boxed{10\\text{ inches}}$. Indeed, $8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100 = 10^2$.

At the same rate, what would be the price for a jar that is 6 inches in diameter and 6 inches high?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The first jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{3}{2})^24=9\\pi$. The second jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{6}{2})^26=54\\pi$. Note that the volume of the second jar is 6 times greater than that of the first jar. Because peanut butter is sold by volume, the second jar will be six times more expensive than the first jar, for an answer of $\\$0.60\\times6=\\boxed{\\$3.60}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Amy and Belinda each roll a sheet of 6-inch by 8-inch paper to form a cylindrical tube. Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together without overlap. Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together without overlap. What is $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Amy's cylinder has a height of 8 and a base circumference of 6.  Let her cylinder have volume $V_A$ and radius $r_A$; we have $2\\pi r_A = 6$ so $r_A = 3/\\pi$ and $V_A = \\pi r_A ^2 h = \\pi (3/\\pi)^2 (8) = 72/\\pi$.\n\nBelinda's cylinder has a height of 6 and a base circumference of 8.  Similarly, let her cylinder have volume $V_B$ and radius $r_B$; we have $2\\pi r_B = 8$ so $r_B = 4/\\pi$ and $V_B = \\pi r_B^2 h = \\pi (4/\\pi)^2 (6) = 96/\\pi$.\n\nThe positive difference between the volume of the two tubes is $96/\\pi - 72/\\pi = 24/\\pi$ cubic inches; $\\pi$ times this difference is $\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Mrs. Read can knit one pair of children's mittens with a ball of yarn six inches in diameter. How many pairs of identical mittens can she knit with a ball of yarn twelve inches in diameter? Assume that the balls of yarn are rolled consistently.\n\nAnswer:\n",
