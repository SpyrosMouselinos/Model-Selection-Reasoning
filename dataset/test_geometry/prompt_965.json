    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $AB$ parallel to $CD$, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. If the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, what is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(2.5inch);\npair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (-3,4);\nB = (5,4);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (0,0);\nE = intersectionpoint(A--C, B--D);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$E$\", E, N);\n[/asy] We will write the area of triangle $XYZ$ as $[XYZ].$  Since triangles $ADC$ and $BCD$ share a base and have the same altitude length to that base, they have the same area. Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$. Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$. Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \\boxed{98}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the trapezoid shown, the ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $ADC$ is $7:3$. If $AB + CD = 210$ cm, how long is segment $\\overline{AB}$? [asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\npair A = (0,0), B = (5,0), C = (3,2), D = (1,2);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle--C);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW); label(\"$B$\",B,SE); label(\"$C$\",C,NE); label(\"$D$\",D,NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $h$ be the height of the trapezoid.  The height of the trapezoid is also a height of $ABC$ and of $ADC$.  Specifically, we have $[ABC] = (AB)(h)/2$ and $[ADC] = (CD)(h)/2$, so $[ABC]:[ADC] = AB:CD$.  Since we are given that this area ratio equals $7:3$, we know that $AB:CD = 7:3$.  Therefore, $AB = 7x$ and $CD = 3x$ for some  value of $x$.  Since $AB + CD = 210$ cm, we have $7x+3x=210$, so $10x=210$ and $x=21$. Therefore,  $AB=7 \\times 21 = \\boxed{147\\text{ cm}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB=AC$ and $D$ is a point on $\\overline{AC}$ so that $\\overline{BD}$ bisects angle $ABC$. If $BD=BC$, what is the measure, in degrees, of angle $A$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $AB=AC$, triangle $ABC$ must be an isosceles triangle and the measures of $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle ACB$ must be equal. Continuing, since $\\overline{BD}$ bisects angle $ABC$, we have that the measures of $\\angle ABD$ and $\\angle BDC$ are equal. Finally, since $BD=BC$, triangle $BDC$ must also be an isosceles triangle so the measures of $\\angle BDC = \\angle BCD$. Now if we consider triangle $BDC$, we know that angles $BDC$ and $BCD$ have equal angle measures and angle $DBC$ has an angle measure that is half that of the other two. Since these three angle measures must add up to $180^\\circ$, we have that $\\angle DBC$ has measure $36^\\circ$ and angles $BDC$ and $BCD$ have measures $72 ^\\circ$.\n\nNow, since $\\angle ABC \\cong \\angle ACB$ and $\\angle ACB$ has measure $72^\\circ$, we know that $\\angle A$ must have an angle measure of $180-72-72=\\boxed{36}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$ with $\\overline{BC}\\parallel\\overline{AD}$, let $BC = 1000$ and $AD = 2008$. Let $\\angle A = 37^\\circ$, $\\angle D = 53^\\circ$, and $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AD}$, respectively. Find the length $MN$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Extend $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ to meet at a point $E$. Then $\\angle AED = 180 - 53 - 37 = 90^{\\circ}$.\n[asy] size(220); defaultpen(0.7+fontsize(10)); real f=100, r=1004/f; pair A=(0,0), D=(2*r, 0), N=(r,0), E=N+r*expi(74*pi/180); pair B=(126*A+125*E)/251, C=(126*D + 125*E)/251; pair[] M = intersectionpoints(N--E,B--C); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle);  draw(B--E--C,dashed); draw(M[0]--N); draw(N--E,dashed); draw(rightanglemark(D,E,A,2)); picture p = new picture;  draw(p,Circle(N,r),dashed+linewidth(0.5)); clip(p,A--D--D+(0,20)--A+(0,20)--cycle); add(p); label(\"\\(A\\)\",A,SW); label(\"\\(B\\)\",B,NW); label(\"\\(C\\)\",C,NE); label(\"\\(D\\)\",D,SE); label(\"\\(E\\)\",E,NE); label(\"\\(M\\)\",M[0],SW); label(\"\\(N\\)\",N,S); label(\"\\(1004\\)\",(N+D)/2,S); label(\"\\(500\\)\",(M[0]+C)/2,S); [/asy]\nAs $\\angle AED = 90^{\\circ}$, note that the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, $N$, is the center of the circumcircle of $\\triangle AED$. We can do the same with the circumcircle about $\\triangle BEC$ and $M$ (or we could apply the homothety to find $ME$ in terms of $NE$). It follows that\n\\[NE = ND = \\frac {AD}{2} = 1004, \\quad ME = MC = \\frac {BC}{2} = 500.\\]\nThus $MN = NE - ME = \\boxed{504}$.\nFor purposes of rigor we will show that $E,M,N$ are collinear. Since $\\overline{BC} \\parallel \\overline{AD}$, then $BC$ and $AD$ are homothetic with respect to point $E$ by a ratio of $\\frac{BC}{AD} = \\frac{125}{251}$. Since the homothety carries the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, $M$, to the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, which is $N$, then $E,M,N$ are collinear.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$, leg $\\overline{BC}$ is perpendicular to bases $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, and diagonals $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{BD}$ are perpendicular. Given that $AB=\\sqrt{11}$ and $AD=\\sqrt{1001}$, find $BC^2$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $x = BC$ be the height of the trapezoid, and let $y = CD$. Since $AC \\perp BD$, it follows that $\\triangle BAC \\sim \\triangle CBD$, so $\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{11}} = \\frac{y}{x} \\Longrightarrow x^2 = y\\sqrt{11}$.\nLet $E$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $\\overline{CD}$. Then $AE = x$, and $ADE$ is a right triangle. By the Pythagorean Theorem,\n\\[x^2 + \\left(y-\\sqrt{11}\\right)^2 = 1001 \\Longrightarrow x^4 - 11x^2 - 11^2 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 10 = 0\\]\nThe positive solution to this quadratic equation is $x^2 = \\boxed{110}$.\n[asy] size(200); pathpen = linewidth(0.7); pair C=(0,0),B=(0,110^.5),A=(11^.5,B.y),D=(10*11^.5,0),E=foot(A,C,D); D(MP(\"A\",A,(2,.5))--MP(\"B\",B,W)--MP(\"C\",C)--MP(\"D\",D)--cycle); D(A--C);D(B--D);D(A--E,linetype(\"4 4\") + linewidth(0.7)); MP(\"\\sqrt{11}\",(A+B)/2,N);MP(\"\\sqrt{1001}\",(A+D)/2,NE);MP(\"\\sqrt{1001}\",(A+D)/2,NE);MP(\"x\",(B+C)/2,W);MP(\"y\",(D+C)/2);D(rightanglemark(B,IP(A--C,B--D),C,20)); [/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ are isosceles with $AB=BC$ and $AD=DC$. Point $D$ is inside $\\triangle ABC$, $\\angle ABC = 40^\\circ$, and $\\angle ADC = 140^\\circ$.  What is the degree measure of $\\angle\nBAD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, \\[\n\\angle BAC=\\frac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\left( 180^{\\circ}-\\angle ABC\\displaystyle\\right)=70^{\\circ}.\n\\] [asy]\npair A,B,C,D;\nA=(-5,0); B=(0,21); C=(5,0); D=(0,6);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw(A--D--C--cycle,linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$140^{\\circ}$\",(0,4),S);\nlabel(\"$40^{\\circ}$\",(0,15),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\n[/asy] Similarly, \\[\n\\angle DAC=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( 180^{\\circ}-\\angle\nADC\\right)=20^{\\circ}.\n\\]  Thus \\[\\angle BAD = \\angle BAC - \\angle DAC\n= \\boxed{50^{\\circ}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, the angle bisectors are $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$, which intersect at the incenter $I$.  If $\\angle ACB = 38^\\circ$, then find the measure of $\\angle AIE$, in degrees.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $AD$ is an angle bisector, $\\angle BAI = \\angle BAC/2$.  Since $BE$ is an angle bisector, $\\angle ABI = \\angle ABC/2$.  As an angle that is external to triangle $ABI$, $\\angle AIE = \\angle BAI + \\angle ABI = \\angle BAC/2 + \\angle ABC/2$.\n\n[asy]\nimport geometry;\n\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, I;\n\nA = (2,12);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (14,0);\nI = incenter(A,B,C);\nD = extension(A,I,B,C);\nE = extension(B,I,C,A);\nF = extension(C,I,A,B);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"$I$\", I, NNE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle ACB = 38^\\circ$, \\[\\angle AIE = \\frac{\\angle BAC + \\angle ABC}{2} = \\frac{180^\\circ - \\angle ACB}{2} = \\frac{180^\\circ - 38^\\circ}{2} = \\boxed{71^\\circ}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system, trapezoid $ABCD$ has vertices $A(1, -2)$, $B(1, 1)$, $C(5, 7)$ and $D(5, 1)$. What is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two bases of the trapezoids are the segments $AB$ and $CD$, and the height is the perpendicular distance between the bases, which in this case is the difference of the $x$-coordinates: $5 - 1 = 4$. Similarly, the lengths of the bases are the differences of the $y$-coordinates of their two endpoints. Using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1+ b_2)h$, the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(3+6)(4) = \\boxed{18}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Isosceles triangle $ABE$ of area 100 square inches is cut by $\\overline{CD}$ into an isosceles trapezoid and a smaller isosceles triangle. The area of the trapezoid is 75 square inches. If the altitude of triangle $ABE$ from $A$ is 20 inches, what is the number of inches in the length of $\\overline{CD}$?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((-9,0)--(0,24)--(9,0)--cycle);\ndraw((-6,8)--(6,8));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,24),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(-9,0),W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-6,8),NW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(6,8),NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(9,0),E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The area of triangle $ABE$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(BE)(20\\text{ in.})$. Setting this equal to $100$ square inches we find $BE=10$ inches.  The area of triangle $ACD$ is $100-75=25$ square inches.  Since triangle $ACD$ is similar to triangle $ABE$ and the ratio of their areas is $\\frac{1}{4}$, the ratio of corresponding side lengths is $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Therefore, $CD=\\frac{1}{2}BE=\\boxed{5}$ inches.\n\nAlternatively, because triangles $ACD$ and $ABE$ are similar, the height-to-base ratio is the same for each of them.  In triangle $ABE$, this ratio is $\\frac{20\\text{ in.}}{10\\text{ in.}}=2$.  Therefore, the height of $ACD$ is $2\\cdot CD$.  Solving $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\cdot CD)(CD)=25\\text{ in.}^2$ we find $CD=5$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$, the parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths of 8 and 20 units, respectively, and the altitude is 12 units. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. What is the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ in square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$. Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Suppose that $ABCD$ is a trapezoid in which $\\overline{AD}|| \\overline{BC}$.  Given $\\overline{AC}\\perp\\overline{CD}$, $\\overline{AC}$ bisects angle $\\angle BAD$, and $[ABCD]=42$, then compute $[\\triangle ACD]$.\n\nAnswer:\n",
