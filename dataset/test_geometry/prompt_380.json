    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The diagram shows a rectangle that has been dissected into nine non-overlapping squares. Given that the width and the height of the rectangle are relatively prime positive integers, find the perimeter of the rectangle.\n[asy]draw((0,0)--(69,0)--(69,61)--(0,61)--(0,0));draw((36,0)--(36,36)--(0,36)); draw((36,33)--(69,33));draw((41,33)--(41,61));draw((25,36)--(25,61)); draw((34,36)--(34,45)--(25,45)); draw((36,36)--(36,38)--(34,38)); draw((36,38)--(41,38)); draw((34,45)--(41,45));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Call the squares' side lengths from smallest to largest $a_1,\\ldots,a_9$, and let $l,w$ represent the dimensions of the rectangle.\nThe picture shows that\\begin{align*} a_1+a_2 &= a_3\\\\ a_1 + a_3 &= a_4\\\\ a_3 + a_4 &= a_5\\\\ a_4 + a_5 &= a_6\\\\ a_2 + a_3 + a_5 &= a_7\\\\ a_2 + a_7 &= a_8\\\\ a_1 + a_4 + a_6 &= a_9\\\\ a_6 + a_9 &= a_7 + a_8.\\end{align*}\nExpressing all terms 3 to 9 in terms of $a_1$ and $a_2$ and substituting their expanded forms into the previous equation will give the expression $5a_1 = 2a_2$.\nWe can guess that $a_1 = 2$. (If we started with $a_1$ odd, the resulting sides would not be integers and we would need to scale up by a factor of $2$ to make them integers; if we started with $a_1 > 2$ even, the resulting dimensions would not be relatively prime and we would need to scale down.) Then solving gives $a_9 = 36$, $a_6=25$, $a_8 = 33$, which gives us $l=61,w=69$. These numbers are relatively prime, as desired. The perimeter is $2(61)+2(69)=\\boxed{260}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two rectangles have integer dimensions, and both have a perimeter of 144 cm. What is the greatest possible difference between the areas of two such rectangles?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the dimensions of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$.  We are given $2l+2w=144$, which implies $l+w=72$.  Solving for $w$, we have $w=72-l$.  The area of the rectangle is $lw=l(72-l)$.  As a function of $l$, this expression is a parabola whose zeros are at $l=0$ and $l=72$ (see graph).  The $y$-coordinate of a point on the parabola is maximized when the $x$-coordinate is chosen as close to the $x$-coordinate of the vertex as possible.  The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the zeros at $x=(0+72)/2=36$, so the maximum area is $(36)(36)=1296$ square units.  Similarly, to minimize the area we choose the length to be as far from $36$ as possible.  The resulting dimensions are $1$ unit and $71$ units, so the minimum area is 71 square units.  The difference between 1296 square units and 71 square units is $\\boxed{1225}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nsize(150,IgnoreAspect);\nreal f(real x)\n{\n\nreturn x*(15-x);\n}\nxaxis(Arrows(4));\nyaxis(ymax=f(7.5),Arrows(4));\ndraw(graph(f,-3,18),Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"Area\",(0,f(7.5)),N);\nlabel(\"$l$\",(18,0),S);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The rectangle with vertices $(-1, y), (7, y), (-1, 3)$, and $(7, 3)$ has an area of 72 square units, and $y$ is positive. What is the value of $y$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First we write the rectangle's side lengths in terms of the coordinates provided. The length is $7-(-1)=8$ and the height is $y-3.$ It follows that $8(y-3)=72,$ and $y=\\boxed{12}.$ [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(4cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nxaxis(Arrows(4));\nyaxis(ymin=-2,Arrows(4));\npair A=(-1,12), B=(7,12), C=(-1,3), D=(7,3);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--D--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$8$\",(A+B)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$y-3$\",(B+D)/2,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.

Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\\left(\\frac{2}{3}x\\right)=\\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\\left(\\frac{2}{3}x^2\\right)=4000$$ or $$\\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \\approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\\boxed{35}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ has sides $\\overline {AB}$ of length 4 and $\\overline {CB}$ of length 3.

For each $k$, $\\overline{P_kQ_k}$ is the hypotenuse of a $3-4-5$ right triangle with sides of $3 \\cdot \\frac{168-k}{168}, 4 \\cdot \\frac{168-k}{168}$. Thus, its length is $5 \\cdot \\frac{168-k}{168}$. Let $a_k=\\frac{5(168-k)}{168}$. We want to find $2\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{168} a_k-5$ since we are over counting the diagonal. $2\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^{168} \\frac{5(168-k)}{168}-5 =2\\frac{(0+5)\\cdot169}{2}-5 =168\\cdot5 =\\boxed{840}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The graph of the equation $9x+223y=2007$ is drawn on graph paper with each square representing one unit in each direction. How many of the $1$ by $1$ graph paper squares have interiors lying entirely below the graph and entirely in the first quadrant?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are $223 \\cdot 9 = 2007$ squares in total formed by the rectangle with edges on the x and y axes and with vertices on the intercepts of the equation, since the intercepts of the lines are $(223,0),\\ (0,9)$.\nCount the number of squares that the diagonal of the rectangle passes through. Since the two diagonals of a rectangle are congruent, we can consider instead the diagonal $y = \\frac{223}{9}x$. This passes through 8 horizontal lines ($y = 1 \\ldots 8$) and 222 vertical lines ($x = 1 \\ldots 222$). At every time we cross a line, we enter a new square. Since 9 and 223 are relatively prime, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about crossing an intersection of a horizontal and vertical line at one time. We must also account for the first square. This means that it passes through $222 + 8 + 1 = 231$ squares.\nThe number of non-diagonal squares is $2007 - 231 = 1776$. Divide this in 2 to get the number of squares in one of the triangles, with the answer being $\\frac{1776}2 = \\boxed{888}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle whose vertices are at $(4, -1)$, $(10, 3)$ and $(4, 5)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$.  Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of rectangle $ABCD$ with vertices $A$(0, 0), $B$(0, 4), $C$($x$, 4) and $D$($x$, 0) is 28 square units. If $x > 0$, what is the value of $x$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the points, we see that the dimensions of the rectangle are $x$ and $4$.  The area of the rectangle is $(\\text{length})(\\text{width})=4x$, so $4x=28$ and $x=\\boxed{7}$.

The third vertex is located on the negative branch of the $x$-axis. What are the coordinates of the third vertex if the area of the triangle is 30 square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that, for a triangle, area = 1/2(base)(height), which equals 30 in this problem. We also know that the height of the triangle is 4 if we use the horizontal leg on the x-axis as the base. Now we can plug this information into the equation to find the length of the base that runs along the x-axis. The equation is $(1/2)(b)(4) = 30$, so $b = 30/2 = 15$. Since the 3rd vertex is on the x-axis we know that it extends straight left 15 units from the vertex at (0, 0), bringing us to the point $\\boxed{(-15, 0)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Segment $s_1$ has endpoints at $(4,1)$ and $(-8,5)$.  Segment $s_2$ is obtained by translating $s_1$ by $2$ units to the right and $3$ units up. Find the midpoint of segment $s_2$.  Express your answer as $(a,b)$ with $a$ and $b$ integers.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The midpoint of segment $s_1$ can be found using the midpoint formula: $\\left(\\frac{4-8}2,\\frac{1+5}2\\right)=(-2,3).$  The midpoint of $s_2$ is the translation of the midpoint of $s_1$ be $2$ units to the right and $3$ units up.  Thus its coordinates are $(-2+2,3+3)=\\boxed{(0,6)}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two nonadjacent vertices of a rectangle are $(4,3)$ and $(-4,-3),$ and the other two vertices have integer coordinates.
