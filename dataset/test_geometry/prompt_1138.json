Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Six small circles, each of radius $3$ units, are tangent to a large circle as shown. Each small circle also is tangent to its two neighboring small circles. What is the diameter of the large circle in units? [asy]\ndraw(Circle((-2,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((2,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((-1,1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((1,1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((-1,-1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((1,-1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),3));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can draw two similar hexagons, an outer one for which the large circle is the circumcircle and an inner one that connects the centers of the smaller circles. We know that the sidelength of the inner hexagon is 6 since $\\overline{DE}$ consists of the radii of two small circles. We also know that the radius of the outer hexagon is 3 units longer than the radius of the inner hexagon since $\\overline{AD}$ is the radius of a small circle. There are now several approaches to solving the problem.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 1:}$ We use a 30-60-90 triangle to find the radius $\\overline{CD}$ of the inner hexagon. Triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle since $\\overline{CE}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are both radii of a regular hexagon. So dropping a perpendicular from $C$ to $\\overline{DE}$ bisects $\\angle C$ and $\\overline{DE}$ and creates two congruent right triangles. The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{6}=60^\\circ$. So $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$. Each right triangle has a leg of length $\\frac{DE}{2}=3$ and is a 30-60-90 right triangle (since $\\angle C$ was bisected into two angles of $30^\\circ$). That makes the length of the hypotenuse (the radius of the inner hexagon) two times the length of the short leg, or $2\\cdot3=6$. Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\\boxed{18}$ units long.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 2:}$ We prove that the triangles formed by the center to two vertices of a regular hexagon (such as $\\triangle CED$ and $\\triangle CBA$) are equilateral triangles. The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60}=60^\\circ$. So $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$. The interior angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{180^\\circ (6-2)}{6}=\\frac{180^\\circ \\cdot4}{6}=30^\\circ \\cdot4=120^\\circ$. That means the other two angles in the triangle each have a measure of half the interior angle, or $60^\\circ$. All three angles equal $60^\\circ$ so the triangle is an equilateral triangle. Then we know that $CD=DE=6$. Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\\boxed{18}$ units long.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 3:}$ Another way to prove that the triangles are equilateral is to show that triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle and $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$ (see other approaches for how). That means $m\\angle D=m\\angle E$ and $m\\angle D+ m\\angle E=120^\\circ$. Then all three angles have a measure of $60^\\circ$ each. We continue the rest of approach 2 after proving that triangle $CED$ is equilateral.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\ndraw(Circle((-2,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((2,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((-1,1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((1,1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((-1,-1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((1,-1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),3));\npair A=(3,0), B=(1.5, 2.598), C=(0,0), D=(-1.5, 2.598), E=(-3,0), F=(-1.5, -2.598), G=(1.5, -2.598);\npair H=(2,0), I=(1, 1.732), J=(-1, 1.732), K=(-2,0), L=(-1, -1.732), M=(1, -1.732);\npath f1=A--B--D--E--F--G--cycle;\npath f2=H--I--J--K--L--M--cycle;\ndraw(f2);\ndraw(f1);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(C--(H+I)/2);\npen sm=fontsize(10);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NE, sm); label(\"B\", B, NE, sm); label(\"C\",C,W, sm);\nlabel(\"D\", H, NE, sm); label(\"E\", I, NE, sm);\nlabel(\"$6$\", (H+I)/2, NE, sm);\nlabel(\"$3$\", (A+H)/2, S, sm);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn.

The area of hexagon $ABCDEF$ is $2\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{25}{2}\\sqrt{3}\\displaystyle\\right)=\\boxed{25\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nAn alternate way to start: let $O$ be the center of the hexagon.  Then triangles $ABC,CDE,$ and $EFA$ are congruent to triangles $AOC,COE,$ and $EOA$, respectively.  Thus the area of the hexagon is twice the area of equilateral $\\triangle ACE$.  Then proceed as in the first solution.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent right circular cones each with base radius $3$ and height $8$ have the axes of symmetry that intersect at right angles at a point in the interior of the cones a distance $3$ from the base of each cone. A sphere with radius $r$ lies withing both cones. The maximum possible value of $r^2$ is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Consider the cross section of the cones and sphere by a plane that contains the two axes of symmetry of the cones as shown below. The sphere with maximum radius will be tangent to the sides of each of the cones. The center of that sphere must be on the axis of symmetry of each of the cones and thus must be at the intersection of their axes of symmetry. Let $A$ be the point in the cross section where the bases of the cones meet, and let $C$ be the center of the sphere. Let the axis of symmetry of one of the cones extend from its vertex, $B$, to the center of its base, $D$. Let the sphere be tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $E$. The right triangles $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle CBE$ are similar, implying that the radius of the sphere is\\[CE = AD \\cdot\\frac{BC}{AB} = AD \\cdot\\frac{BD-CD}{AB} =3\\cdot\\frac5{\\sqrt{8^2+3^2}} = \\frac{15}{\\sqrt{73}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{225}{73}}.\\]The requested sum is $225+73=\\boxed{298}$.[asy] unitsize(0.6cm); pair A = (0,0);  pair TriangleOneLeft = (-6,0);  pair TriangleOneDown = (-3,-8);  pair TriangleOneMid = (-3,0);  pair D = (0,-3);  pair TriangleTwoDown = (0,-6);  pair B = (-8,-3);  pair C = IP(TriangleOneMid -- TriangleOneDown, B--D); pair EE = foot(C, A, B);  real radius = arclength(C--EE);  path circ = Circle(C, radius);    draw(A--B--TriangleTwoDown--cycle); draw(B--D);  draw(A--TriangleOneLeft--TriangleOneDown--cycle);  draw(circ);  draw(C--EE);  draw(TriangleOneMid -- TriangleOneDown, gray);  dot(\"$B$\", B, W);  dot(\"$E$\", EE, NW);  dot(\"$A$\", A, NE);  dot(\"$D$\", D, E);  dot(\"$C$\", C, SE); [/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular hexagon is inscribed in a circle and another regular hexagon is circumscribed about the same circle. What is the ratio of the area of the larger hexagon to the area of the smaller hexagon? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Form a triangle whose first vertex is the center of the circle and whose other two vertices are the midpoint and one of the endpoints of a side of the larger hexagon, as shown in the diagram.  Since each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees, this triangle is a 30-60-90 right triangle.  Let $r$ be the radius of the circle.  The length of the longer leg of the triangle is $r$, so the length of the shorter leg is $r/\\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $2r/\\sqrt{3}$.  Since for the smaller hexagon the length of the segment connecting a vertex to the center is $r$, the dimensions of the larger hexagon are $2/\\sqrt{3}$ times larger than the dimensions of the smaller hexagon.  Therefore, the area of the larger triangle is $(2/\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$ times greater than the area of the smaller triangle.\n\n[asy]\nsize(5cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));\nfor(i=0;i<=5;++i)\n\n{\n\ndraw(dir(60*i)--dir(60*(i+1)));\n\ndraw(2/sqrt(3)*dir(60*i)--2/sqrt(3)*dir(60*(i+1)));\n\n}\ndraw(2/sqrt(3)*dir(0)--(0,0)--dir(30));\ndraw(0.93*dir(30)--dir(30)+0.07*dir(-60)+0.07*dir(210)--dir(30)+0.07*dir(-60));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many square units are in the area of the parallelogram with vertices at (0, 0), (6, 0), (2, 8) and (8, 8)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The measure of the base of the parallelogram is 6 units and the height of the parallelogram is 8 units.

In square units, what is the area of the hexagon? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect opposite pairs of vertices of the regular hexagon with line segments as shown.  Since each angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees, the six triangles produced are equilateral.  The diameter of the circle circumscribed around the hexagon is equal to twice the side length of each of the triangles.  Therefore, each triangle has side length 2 units.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ units is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$ square units.  (To show this, divide the equilateral triangle into two smaller 30-60-90 triangles.)  Substituting $s=2$, we find that the area of each triangle is $\\sqrt{3}$ square units.  Therefore, area of the hexagon is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(3.5cm);\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\n\nfor(i=0;i<=5;i=i+1)\n\n{\n\ndot((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\ndraw((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6))--(cos(2*pi*(i+1)/6),sin(2*pi*(i+1)/6)));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\n}\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A truncated cone has horizontal bases with radii 18 and 2.

A great circle of the sphere is tangent to all four sides of trapezoid $ABCD$. Let $E,F$, and $G$ be the points of tangency on $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CD}$, respectively.
