    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Square $ABCD$ has sides of length 2. Set $S$ is the set of all line segments that have length 2 and whose endpoints are on adjacent sides of the square. The midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ enclose a region whose area to the nearest hundredth is $k$. Find $100k$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Without loss of generality, let $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$ be the vertices of the square. Suppose the endpoints of the segment lie on the two sides of the square determined by the vertex $(0,0)$. Let the two endpoints of the segment have coordinates $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$. Because the segment has length 2, $x^2+y^2=4$. Using the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of the segment has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Let $d$ be the distance from $(0,0)$ to $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Using the distance formula we see that $d=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2}= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^2+y^2\\right)}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}(4)}=1$. Thus the midpoints lying on the sides determined by vertex $(0,0)$ form a quarter-circle with radius 1.\n[asy] size(100); pointpen=black;pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(2,0),C=(2,2),D=(0,2); D(A--B--C--D--A);  picture p; draw(p,CR(A,1));draw(p,CR(B,1));draw(p,CR(C,1));draw(p,CR(D,1)); clip(p,A--B--C--D--cycle); add(p); [/asy]\nThe set of all midpoints forms a quarter circle at each corner of the square. The area enclosed by all of the midpoints is $4-4\\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=4-\\pi \\approx .86$ to the nearest hundredth. Thus $100\\cdot k=\\boxed{86}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In rectangle $ABCD$, $AB=100$. Let $E$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$. Given that line $AC$ and line $BE$ are perpendicular, find the greatest integer less than $AD$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] pair A=(0,10), B=(0,0), C=(14,0), D=(14,10), Q=(0,5); draw (A--B--C--D--cycle); pair E=(7,10); draw (B--E); draw (A--C); pair F=(6.7,6.7); label(\"\\(E\\)\",E,N); label(\"\\(A\\)\",A,NW); label(\"\\(B\\)\",B,SW); label(\"\\(C\\)\",C,SE); label(\"\\(D\\)\",D,NE); label(\"\\(F\\)\",F,W); label(\"\\(100\\)\",Q,W); [/asy]\nFrom the problem, $AB=100$ and triangle $FBA$ is a right triangle. As $ABCD$ is a rectangle, triangles $BCA$, and $ABE$ are also right triangles. By $AA$, $\\triangle FBA \\sim \\triangle BCA$, and $\\triangle FBA \\sim \\triangle ABE$, so $\\triangle ABE \\sim \\triangle BCA$. This gives $\\frac {AE}{AB}= \\frac {AB}{BC}$. $AE=\\frac{AD}{2}$ and $BC=AD$, so $\\frac {AD}{2AB}= \\frac {AB}{AD}$, or $(AD)^2=2(AB)^2$, so $AD=AB \\sqrt{2}$, or $100 \\sqrt{2}$, so the answer is $\\boxed{141}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n One base of a trapezoid is $100$ units longer than the other base. The segment that joins the midpoints of the legs divides the trapezoid into two regions whose areas are in the ratio $2: 3$. Let $x$ be the length of the segment joining the legs of the trapezoid that is parallel to the bases and that divides the trapezoid into two regions of equal area. Find the greatest integer that does not exceed $x^2/100$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the shorter base have length $b$ (so the longer has length $b+100$), and let the height be $h$. The length of the midline of the trapezoid is the average of its bases, which is $\\frac{b+b+100}{2} = b+50$. The two regions which the midline divides the trapezoid into are two smaller trapezoids, both with height $h/2$. Then,\n[asy]pathpen = linewidth(0.7); pen d = linetype(\"4 4\") + linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(175,0),C=(105,100),D=(30,100); D(A--B--C--D--cycle); D((A+D)/2 -- (B+C)/2, d); MP(\"b\",(C+D)/2,N);MP(\"b+100\",(A+B)/2);  [/asy]\n\\[\\frac{\\frac 12 (h/2) (b + b+50)}{\\frac 12 (h/2) (b + 50 + b + 100)} = \\frac{2}{3} \\Longrightarrow \\frac{b + 75}{b + 25} = \\frac 32 \\Longrightarrow b = 75\\]\nWe now construct the line which divides the rectangle into two regions of equal area. Suppose this line is a distance of $h_1$ from the shorter base. By similar triangles, we have $\\frac{x - 75}{100} = \\frac{h_1}{h}$. Indeed, construct the perpendiculars from the vertices of the shorter base to the longer base. This splits the trapezoid into a rectangle and two triangles; it also splits the desired line segment into three partitions with lengths $x_1, 75, x_2$. By similar triangles, we easily find that $\\frac{x - 75}{100} = \\frac{x_1+x_2}{100} = \\frac{h_1}{h}$, as desired.\n[asy]pathpen = linewidth(0.7); pen d = linetype(\"4 4\") + linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(175,0),C=(105,100),D=(30,100),E=D*(1.75-(18125)^.5/100),F=IP(B--C,E--(175,E.y)); D(A--B--C--D--cycle); MP(\"75\",(C+D)/2,N);MP(\"175\",(A+B)/2); D(C--(C.x,0),d);D(D--(D.x,0),d); D(E--F,d); D((-20,100)--(-20,0)); MP(\"h\",(-20,50),(-1,0));MP(\"h_1\",(C.x,(C.y+E.y)/2),(-1,0)); MP(\"x_1\",((E.x+D.x)/2,E.y));MP(\"x_2\",((F.x+C.x)/2,E.y)); [/asy]\nThe area of the region including the shorter base must be half of the area of the entire trapezoid, so\n\\[2 \\cdot \\frac 12 h_1 (75 + x) = \\frac 12 h (75 + 175) \\Longrightarrow x = 125 \\cdot \\frac{h}{h_1} - 75\\]\nSubstituting our expression for $\\frac h{h_1}$ from above, we find that\n\\[x = \\frac{12500}{x-75} - 75 \\Longrightarrow x^2 - 75x = 5625 + 12500 - 75x \\Longrightarrow x^2 = 18125\\]\nThe answer is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x^2}{100}\\right\\rfloor = \\boxed{181}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Square $ABCD$ has side length $1$ unit.  Points $E$ and $F$ are on sides $AB$ and $CB$, respectively, with $AE = CF$.  When the square is folded along the lines $DE$ and $DF$, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide and lie on diagonal $BD$.  The length of segment $AE$ can be expressed in the form $\\sqrt{k}-m$ units. What is the integer value of $k+m$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We start by drawing a diagram.  When the paper is folded, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide on the longer dashed line, and points $A$ and $C$ meet at $G$, as you can see below.  [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(1,.4)); draw((0,0)--(.4,1));\ndraw((1,.4)--(.4,1),dashed);\ndraw((0,0)--(.7,.7),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1), NW); label(\"$B$\",(1,1), NE); label(\"$C$\",(1,0), SE); label(\"$D$\",(0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",(1,.4), E); label(\"$E$\",(.4,1), N);\nlabel(\"$G$\",(.7,.7), NE);\n[/asy] Now, we assign variables.  We are looking for the length of $AE$, so let $AE=x$.  Then, $BE=1-x$.  Because of the symmetry of the square and the fold, everything to the left of line $BD$ is a mirror image of everything to the right of $BD$.  Thus, $\\triangle BEF$ is an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90), so $EF=\\sqrt{2}EB = \\sqrt{2}(1-x)$.  Also, $\\triangle EGB$ and $\\triangle FGB$ are congruent 45-45-90 triangles, so $GB = \\frac{EB}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nAlso, notice that because the way the paper is folded (its original position versus its final position), we have more congruent triangles, $\\triangle AED \\cong \\triangle GED$.  This means that $AD=GD=1$.\n\nLastly, notice that since $G$ is on $BD$, we have $BD=BG+GD$. $BD$ is a diagonal of the square, so it has side length $\\sqrt{2}$, $GD=1$, and $GB = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  Thus, our equation becomes \\[\\sqrt{2} = 1 + \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\] Multiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$ yields $2=\\sqrt{2}+1-x$; solving for $x$ yields $x=\\sqrt{2}-1$.  Thus, $AE=\\sqrt{2}-1=\\sqrt{k}-m$, and we see that $k+m=2+1=\\boxed{3}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Centered at each lattice point in the coordinate plane are a circle radius $\\frac{1}{10}$ and a square with sides of length $\\frac{1}{5}$ whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. The line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(1001, 429)$ intersects $m$ of the squares and $n$ of the circles. Find $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First note that $1001 = 143 \\cdot 7$ and $429 = 143 \\cdot 3$ so every point of the form $(7k, 3k)$ is on the line. Then consider the line $l$ from $(7k, 3k)$ to $(7(k + 1), 3(k + 1))$. Translate the line $l$ so that $(7k, 3k)$ is now the origin. There is one square and one circle that intersect the line around $(0,0)$. Then the points on $l$ with an integral $x$-coordinate are, since $l$ has the equation $y = \\frac{3x}{7}$:\n\\[(0,0), \\left(1, \\frac{3}{7}\\right), \\left(2, \\frac{6}{7}\\right), \\left(3, 1 + \\frac{2}{7}\\right), \\left(4, 1 + \\frac{5}{7}\\right), \\left(5, 2 + \\frac{1}{7}\\right), \\left(6, 2 + \\frac{4}{7}\\right), (7,3).\\]\nWe claim that the lower right vertex of the square centered at $(2,1)$ lies on $l$. Since the square has side length $\\frac{1}{5}$, the lower right vertex of this square has coordinates $\\left(2 + \\frac{1}{10},  1 - \\frac{1}{10}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{21}{10}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right)$. Because $\\frac{9}{10} = \\frac{3}{7} \\cdot \\frac{21}{10}$, $\\left(\\frac{21}{10}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right)$ lies on $l$. Since the circle centered at $(2,1)$ is contained inside the square, this circle does not intersect $l$. Similarly the upper left vertex of the square centered at $(5,2)$ is on $l$. Since every other point listed above is farther away from a lattice point (excluding (0,0) and (7,3)) and there are two squares with centers strictly between $(0,0)$ and $(7,3)$ that intersect $l$. Since there are $\\frac{1001}{7} = \\frac{429}{3} = 143$ segments from $(7k, 3k)$ to $(7(k + 1), 3(k + 1))$, the above count is yields $143 \\cdot 2 = 286$ squares. Since every lattice point on $l$ is of the form $(3k, 7k)$ where $0 \\le k \\le 143$, there are $144$ lattice points on $l$. Centered at each lattice point, there is one square and one circle, hence this counts $288$ squares and circles. Thus $m + n = 286 + 288 = \\boxed{574}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Charlyn walks completely around the boundary of a square whose sides are each 5 km long. From any point on her path she can see exactly 1 km horizontally in all directions. What is the area of the region consisting of all points Charlyn can see during her walk, expressed in square kilometers and rounded to the nearest whole number?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n At any point on Charlyn's walk, she can see all the points inside a circle of radius 1 km. The portion of the viewable region inside the square consists of the interior of the square except for a smaller square with side length 3 km. This portion of the viewable region has area $(25-9)$ km$^2$. The portion of the viewable region outside the square consists of four rectangles, each 5 km by 1 km, and four quarter-circles, each with a radius of 1 km. This portion of the viewable region has area $4 \\left(5+\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\right)=(20+\\pi)\\text{\nkm}^2$. The area of the entire viewable region is $36+\\pi\\approx\n\\boxed{39}\\text{ km}^2$.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((5.8,5.8)..(6,5)--(5,5)--(5,6)..cycle);\ndraw((-5.8,-5.8)..(-6,-5)--(-5,-5)--(-5,-6)..cycle);\ndraw((-5.8,5.8)..(-5,6)--(-5,5)--(-6,5)..cycle);\ndraw((5.8,-5.8)..(5,-6)--(5,-5)--(6,-5)..cycle);\ndraw((-5,6)--(5,6));\ndraw((-6,5)--(-6,-5));\ndraw((-5,-6)--(5,-6));\ndraw((6,5)--(6,-5));\ndraw((5,5)--(5,-5)--(-5,-5)--(-5,5)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((4,4)--(4,-4)--(-4,-4)--(-4,4)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((5,0),1));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Square $ABCD$ has area $200$. Point $E$ lies on side $\\overline{BC}$. Points $F$ and $G$ are the midpoints of $\\overline{AE}$ and $\\overline{DE}$, respectively. Given that quadrilateral $BEGF$ has area $34$, what is the area of triangle $GCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We begin by drawing a diagram: [asy]\nsize(5cm);\npair a=(0,1); pair b=(1,1); pair c=(1,0); pair d=(0,0); pair e=(1,.82); pair f=(a+e)/2; pair g=(d+e)/2;\nfill(b--e--g--f--cycle,gray);\nfill(g--c--d--cycle,pink);\ndot(a);dot(b);dot(c);dot(d);dot(e);dot(f);dot(g);\ndraw(a--b--c--d--a);\ndraw(a--e--d);\ndraw(e--g--f--b);\ndraw(g--c);\nlabel(\"$A$\",a,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",b,NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",c,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",d,SW);\nlabel(\"$E$\",e,E);\nlabel(\"$F$\",f,SW);\nlabel(\"$G$\",g,NW);\n[/asy] We know that the gray area above (quadrilateral $BEGF$) has area $34$, and we wish to determine the pink area ($\\triangle GCD$).\n\nFirst we note that $\\triangle AED$ has base $AD$, equal to the side length of square $ABCD$, and also has height equal to the side length of square $ABCD$. Thus $\\triangle AED$ has area equal to half the area of $ABCD$, or $100$.\n\nTriangle $\\triangle FEG$ has half the base and half the height of $\\triangle AED$, so its area is $\\frac12\\cdot\\frac 12\\cdot 100 = 25$.\n\nSince quadrilateral $BEGF$ can be divided into $\\triangle FEG$ and $\\triangle FBE$, we know that $\\triangle FBE$ has area $34-25=9$. This is half the area of $\\triangle ABE$ (which shares an altitude with $\\triangle FBE$ and has twice the corresponding base). Thus, $\\triangle ABE$ has area $18$.\n\nSince square $ABCD$ can be divided into triangles $ABE$, $AED$, and $ECD$, we know that the area of $\\triangle ECD$ is $200-100-18 = 82$. Finally, $\\triangle GCD$ shares an altitude with $\\triangle ECD$ and has half the corresponding base, so the area of $\\triangle GCD$ is $\\frac 12\\cdot 82$, or $\\boxed{41}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The side lengths of a triangle are 14 cm, 48 cm and 50 cm. How many square centimeters are in the area of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Shrinking the triangle by dividing every side length by 2, we recognize the resulting set $$\\{7,24,25\\}$$ of side lengths as a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the original triangle is also a right triangle, and its legs measure 14 cm and 48 cm.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(14\\text{ cm})(48\\text{ cm})=\\boxed{336}$ square centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A quadrilateral that has consecutive sides of lengths $70,90,130$ and $110$ is inscribed in a circle and also has a circle inscribed in it. The point of tangency of the inscribed circle to the side of length 130 divides that side into segments of length $x$ and $y$. Find $|x-y|$.\n$\\text{(A) } 12\\quad \\text{(B) } 13\\quad \\text{(C) } 14\\quad \\text{(D) } 15\\quad \\text{(E) } 16$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be the vertices of this quadrilateral such that $AB=70$, $BC=110$, $CD=130$, and $DA=90$. Let $O$ be the center of the incircle. Draw in the radii from the center of the incircle to the points of tangency. Let these points of tangency $X$, $Y$, $Z$, and $W$ be on $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, and $DA$, respectively. Using the right angles and the fact that the $ABCD$ is cyclic, we see that quadrilaterals $AXOW$ and $OYCZ$ are similar.\nLet $CZ$ have length $n$. Chasing lengths, we find that $AX=AW=n-40$. Using Brahmagupta's Formula we find that $ABCD$ has area $K=300\\sqrt{1001}$ and from that we find, using that fact that $rs=K$, where $r$ is the inradius and $s$ is the semiperimeter, $r=\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{1001}$.\nFrom the similarity we have\\[\\frac{CY}{OX}=\\frac{OY}{AX}\\]Or, after cross multiplying and writing in terms of the variables,\\[n^2-40n-r^2=0\\]Plugging in the value of $r$ and solving the quadratic gives $n=CZ=71.5$, and from there we compute the desired difference to get $\\boxed{13}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $ABC$ is an equilateral triangle with sides equal to 2cm. $\\overline{BC}$ is extended its own length to $D$, and $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$.
