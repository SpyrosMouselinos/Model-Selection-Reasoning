Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base that measures 10 cm on each side. Its peak is 12 cm above the center of its base. What is the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"12\",(6.5,5),E);\n\ndraw((6.6,15)..(6.7,14.9)..(6.8,14.7)--(6.8,5.3)..(6.9,5.2)..(7,5)..(6.9,4.8)..(6.8,4.7)--(6.8,1.8)..(6.7,1.6)..(6.6,1.5),linewidth(.7));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To start, we can draw in a line from where the altitude meets the base to one of the bottom corners as shown:\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,1.5)--(10,0),linewidth(.7));\n[/asy]\n\nThe length of this segment will be half the length of the diagonal of the base.  The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn.

Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\\left(\\frac{2}{3}x\\right)=\\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\\left(\\frac{2}{3}x^2\\right)=4000$$ or $$\\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \\approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\\boxed{35}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right square pyramid with base edges of length $8\\sqrt{2}$ units each and slant edges of length 10 units each is cut by a plane that is parallel to its base and 3 units above its base.

Segment $DC$ is a leg of the isosceles right triangle $CDF$ whose hypotenuse is $8\\sqrt{2}$.  Therefore, $CD=8\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=8$.  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle $ACD$ gives $AC=6$.  Since $BC=3$, this implies that $AB=3$.  By the similarity of $ABE$ and $ACD$, we find $BE=4$.   The diagonal of the smaller square is $2\\cdot BE = 8$, so its area is $8^2/2=32$.

Since all three triangles share an angle, it follows that they must be similar. Notice that the base of $T_3$ is equal to $2+4+6 = 12$, and its height is equal to $6$. This, the height-to-base ratio of each of $T_1$ and $T_2$ is equal to $6/12 = 1/2$. Since the base of $T_1$ is $2$ and the base of $T_2$ is $2+4 = 6$, it follows that their heights are, respectively, $2 \\cdot (1/2) = 1$ and $6 \\cdot (1/2) = 3$.

(If we started with $a_1$ odd, the resulting sides would not be integers and we would need to scale up by a factor of $2$ to make them integers; if we started with $a_1 > 2$ even, the resulting dimensions would not be relatively prime and we would need to scale down.) Then solving gives $a_9 = 36$, $a_6=25$, $a_8 = 33$, which gives us $l=61,w=69$. These numbers are relatively prime, as desired. The perimeter is $2(61)+2(69)=\\boxed{260}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The figure shown is a cube. The distance between vertices $B$ and $G$ is $5\\sqrt{2}$ units.

Since this diagonal splits the square face into two $45-45-90$ triangles, the diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$ times longer than a side of the square, so a side of the square measures $5\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=5$ units.
