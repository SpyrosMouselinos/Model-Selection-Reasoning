    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has three different integer side lengths and a perimeter of 20 units. What is the maximum length of any one side?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A triangle with sides of 9,8 and 3 will satisfy these conditions.  This will have longest side of 9.  If the longest side has length 10, then the sum of the remaining two sides $x+y$ must be greater than 10 by the triangle inequality.  However, this cannot be since this will equal 10, and thus, the maximum length of one side is $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is three times as long as a second  side, and the length of the third side is 15. What is the greatest possible perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $x$, $3x$, and 15. The Triangle Inequality implies that $3x<x+15$, so $x<7.5$. Because $x$ is an integer, the greatest possible perimeter is $7+21+15=\\boxed{43}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 33 units and 42 units. The third side also has an integral length. What is the least possible number of units in the perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The sum of the smaller two sides must exceed the greatest side, so if $x$ is the missing side then $x+33>42\\implies x>9$.  The smallest integer greater than 9 is 10, so the least perimeter is $10+33+42=\\boxed{85}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the smallest possible perimeter, in units, of a triangle whose side-length measures are consecutive integer values?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The smallest such triangle has lengths 1, 2, and 3. However, this triangle doesn't work since the sum of any two side lengths must be greater than the third side length (by the Triangle Inequality). The next smallest triangle has lengths 2, 3, and 4, which works. Thus, the smallest possible perimeter is $2+3+4=\\boxed{9}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two noncongruent integer-sided isosceles triangles have the same perimeter and the same area. The ratio of the lengths of the bases of the two triangles is $8: 7$. Find the minimum possible value of their common perimeter.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the first triangle have side lengths $a$, $a$, $14c$, and the second triangle have side lengths $b$, $b$, $16c$, where $a, b, 2c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nEqual perimeter:\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} 2a+14c&=&2b+16c\\\\ a+7c&=&b+8c\\\\ c&=&a-b\\\\ \\end{array}$\nEqual Area:\n$\\begin{array}{cccl} 7c(\\sqrt{a^2-(7c)^2})&=&8c(\\sqrt{b^2-(8c)^2})&{}\\\\ 7(\\sqrt{(a+7c)(a-7c)})&=&8(\\sqrt{(b+8c)(b-8c)})&{}\\\\ 7(\\sqrt{(a-7c)})&=&8(\\sqrt{(b-8c)})&\\text{(Note that } a+7c=b+8c)\\\\ 49a-343c&=&64b-512c&{}\\\\ 49a+169c&=&64b&{}\\\\ 49a+169(a-b)&=&64b&\\text{(Note that } c=a-b)\\\\ 218a&=&233b&{}\\\\ \\end{array}$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integer, the minimum occurs when $a=233$, $b=218$, and $c=15$. Hence, the perimeter is $2a+14c=2(233)+14(15)=\\boxed{676}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has positive integer side lengths with $AB=AC$. Let $I$ be the intersection of the bisectors of $\\angle B$ and $\\angle C$. Suppose $BI=8$. Find the smallest possible perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $D$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$. Then by SAS Congruence, $\\triangle ABD \\cong \\triangle ACD$, so $\\angle ADB = \\angle ADC = 90^o$.\nNow let $BD=y$, $AB=x$, and $\\angle IBD = \\dfrac{\\angle ABD}{2} = \\theta$.\nThen $\\mathrm{cos}{(\\theta)} = \\dfrac{y}{8}$\nand $\\mathrm{cos}{(2\\theta)} = \\dfrac{y}{x} = 2\\mathrm{cos^2}{(\\theta)} - 1 = \\dfrac{y^2-32}{32}$.\nCross-multiplying yields $32y = x(y^2-32)$.\nSince $x,y>0$, $y^2-32$ must be positive, so $y > 5.5$.\nAdditionally, since $\\triangle IBD$ has hypotenuse $\\overline{IB}$ of length $8$, $BD=y < 8$.\nTherefore, given that $BC=2y$ is an integer, the only possible values for $y$ are $6$, $6.5$, $7$, and $7.5$.\nHowever, only one of these values, $y=6$, yields an integral value for $AB=x$, so we conclude that $y=6$ and $x=\\dfrac{32(6)}{(6)^2-32}=48$.\nThus the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ must be $2(x+y) = \\boxed{108}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of the sides of a triangle are 6 cm, 7 cm and 9 cm.  In a similar triangle whose perimeter is 110 cm, what is the length of the longest side, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the ratio of side lengths between the similar triangle and the given triangle be $x$, so the lengths of the similar triangle are $6x$, $7x$, and $9x$.  We are given that $6x+7x+9x=110$; solving yields $x=\\frac{110}{(6+7+9)} = \\frac{110}{22}=5$.  The length of the longest side is thus $9x = 9 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{45}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles triangle has side lengths 8 cm, 8 cm and 10 cm.  The longest side of a similar triangle is 25 cm. What is the perimeter of the larger triangle, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the length of the longest sides of the small triangle to the large triangle is $10/25 = 2/5$, which must hold constant for all sides of the two triangles since they are similar.  Thus the perimeters of the two triangles are also in the ratio of $2/5$.  The small triangle has perimeter $8+8+10=26$, so the large triangle has perimeter $\\frac{5}{2}\\cdot 26 = \\boxed{65}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many different triangles can be formed having a perimeter of 7 units if each side must have integral length?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $a,b,$ and $c$ represent the three side lengths of the triangle. The perimeter is $a+b+c=7,$ so $b+c=7-a$. We know by the Triangle Inequality that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle must be greater than the third side length. If we focus on the variable $a$, we have\n\\[b+c>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 7-a>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 3.5>a.\\]We could easily replace $a$ with $b$ or $c$, so the maximum length of any of the three sides is $3$. If $a=3$, then $b+c=4$ and $b$ and $c$ could be $1$ and $3$ in some order or $2$ and $2$ in some order. If we let $a=2$ or $a=1$ and the maximum side length is $3$, we'll still end up with triangles of side lengths $(1,3,3)$ or $(2,2,3)$. There are $\\boxed{2}$ different triangles.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two sides of a triangle are each $8$ units long. If the third side has a whole number length, what is the greatest possible perimeter, in units, for the triangle?\n\nAnswer:\n",
