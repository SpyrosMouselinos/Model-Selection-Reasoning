    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A two-inch cube ($2\\times2\\times2$) of silver weighs 3 pounds and is worth $\\$200$. How much is a three-inch cube of silver worth?  Round your answer to the nearest dollar.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a two-inch cube is $2^3=8$ cu inches, while that of a three-inch cube is 27 cu inches. Therefore, the weight and value of the larger cube is $\\frac{27}{8}$ times that of the smaller. $\\$200(\\frac{27}{8})=\\boxed{\\$675}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A jar of peanut butter which is 3 inches in diameter and 4 inches high sells for $\\$$0.60. At the same rate, what would be the price for a jar that is 6 inches in diameter and 6 inches high?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The first jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{3}{2})^24=9\\pi$. The second jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{6}{2})^26=54\\pi$. Note that the volume of the second jar is 6 times greater than that of the first jar. Because peanut butter is sold by volume, the second jar will be six times more expensive than the first jar, for an answer of $\\$0.60\\times6=\\boxed{\\$3.60}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right, rectangular prism has three faces with areas of $6,8$ and $12$ square inches. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=6$, $wh=8$, and $lh=12$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=6\\cdot8\\cdot12=3\\cdot2\\cdot2^3\\cdot2^2\\cdot3=2^6\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^3\\cdot3=\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base that measures 10 cm on each side. Its peak is 12 cm above the center of its base. What is the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"12\",(6.5,5),E);\n\ndraw((6.6,15)..(6.7,14.9)..(6.8,14.7)--(6.8,5.3)..(6.9,5.2)..(7,5)..(6.9,4.8)..(6.8,4.7)--(6.8,1.8)..(6.7,1.6)..(6.6,1.5),linewidth(.7));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To start, we can draw in a line from where the altitude meets the base to one of the bottom corners as shown:\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,1.5)--(10,0),linewidth(.7));\n[/asy]\n\nThe length of this segment will be half the length of the diagonal of the base.  The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The cube below has sides of length 4 feet. If a cylindrical section of radius 2 feet is removed from the solid, what is the total remaining volume of the cube? Express your answer in cubic feet in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nimport solids; size(150); import three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); currentprojection = orthographic(4,2.5,3);\n\ndraw((1,-1,0)--(1,1,0)--(-1,1,0)); draw((-1,1,0)--(-1,-1,0)--(1,-1,0), dashed);\ndraw((1,-1,2)--(1,1,2)--(-1,1,2)--(-1,-1,2)--cycle);\ndraw((1,-1,0)--(1,-1,2)); draw((1,1,0)--(1,1,2)); draw((-1,-1,0)--(-1,-1,2),dashed); draw((-1,1,0)--(-1,1,2));revolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), 1, 2);\ndraw(c,black);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cube has volume $4^3=64$ cubic feet.  The cylinder has radius 2, height 4, and volume $\\pi(2^2)(4)=16\\pi$ cubic feet.  It follows that when the cylindrical section is removed from the solid, the remaining volume is $\\boxed{64-16\\pi}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A solid right prism $ABCDEF$ has a height of $16,$ as shown. Also, its bases are equilateral triangles with side length $12.$ Points $X,$ $Y,$ and $Z$ are the midpoints of edges $AC,$ $BC,$ and $DC,$ respectively. A part of the prism above is sliced off with a straight cut through points $X,$ $Y,$ and $Z.$ Determine the surface area of solid $CXYZ,$ the part that was sliced off.

Using the ratios from this special triangle, $$CM = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(CX)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(6)=3\\sqrt{3}.$$Since $XY = 6,$ the area of $\\triangle CXY$ is $$\\frac{1}{2}(6)(3\\sqrt{3})=9\\sqrt{3}.$$Area of $\\triangle XYZ:$\n\nWe have $XY = 6$ and $XZ = YZ = 10$ and drop an altitude from $Z$ to $XY.$ Since $\\triangle XYZ$ is isosceles, this altitude meets $XY$ at its midpoint, $M,$ and we have $$XM = MY = \\frac{1}{2}(XY)=3.$$By the Pythagorean Theorem,  \\begin{align*}\nZM &= \\sqrt{ZX^2 - XM^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{10^2-3^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{91}.\n\\end{align*}Since $XY = 6,$ the area of $\\triangle XYZ$ is $$\\frac{1}{2}(6)(\\sqrt{91})=3\\sqrt{91}.$$Finally, the total surface area of solid $CXYZ$ is $$24+24+9\\sqrt{3}+3\\sqrt{91}=\\boxed{48+9\\sqrt{3}+3\\sqrt{91}}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid with volume 40 cubic inches has a rectangular base. If the length of the base is doubled, the width tripled and the height increased by $50\\%$, what is the volume of the new pyramid, in cubic inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the volume of a pyramid is linear in each of length, width, and height (in particular, $V = \\frac{1}{3} lwh$), multiplying any of these dimensions by a scalar multiplies the volume by the same scalar.  So the new volume is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 1.50 = 9$ times the old one, or $\\boxed{360}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n One of the five faces of the triangular prism shown here will be used as the base of a new pyramid. The numbers of exterior faces, vertices and edges of the resulting shape (the fusion of the prism and pyramid) are added. What is the maximum value of this sum?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(9,12)--(25,0)--cycle);\ndraw((9,12)--(12,14)--(28,2)--(25,0));\ndraw((12,14)--(3,2)--(0,0),dashed);\ndraw((3,2)--(28,2),dashed);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The original prism has 5 faces, 9 edges, and 6 vertices.  If the new pyramid is added to a triangular face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 3 new faces.  If instead the new pyramid is added to a quadrilateral face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 4 new edges, and 4 new faces.  So, we maximize the sum by adding a pyramid to a quadrilateral face.  This gives us a solid with $5-1+4 = 8$ faces, $9+4=13$ edges, and $6 + 1 = 7$ vertices.  The sum of these is $\\boxed{28}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A unit cube is cut twice to form three triangular prisms, two of which are congruent, as shown in Figure 1. The cube is then cut in the same manner along the dashed lines shown in Figure 2. This creates nine pieces.

It is a pyramid with vertices $V, W, X,Y$, and $Z$. Its base $WXYZ$  is a square with sides of length $1/2$ and its altitude $VW$ is 1.
