    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone has a base with radius $600$ and height $200\\sqrt{7}.$ A fly starts at a point on the surface of the cone whose distance from the vertex of the cone is $125$, and crawls along the surface of the cone to a point on the exact opposite side of the cone whose distance from the vertex is $375\\sqrt{2}.$ Find the least distance that the fly could have crawled.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The easiest way is to unwrap the cone into a circular sector. Center the sector at the origin with one radius on the positive $x$-axis and the angle $\\theta$ going counterclockwise. The circumference of the base is $C=1200\\pi$. The sector's radius (cone's sweep) is $R=\\sqrt{r^2+h^2}=\\sqrt{600^2+(200\\sqrt{7})^2}=\\sqrt{360000+280000}=\\sqrt{640000}=800$. Setting $\\theta R=C\\implies 800\\theta=1200\\pi\\implies\\theta=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\nIf the starting point $A$ is on the positive $x$-axis at $(125,0)$ then we can take the end point $B$ on $\\theta$'s bisector at $\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ radians along the $y=-x$ line in the second quadrant. Using the distance from the vertex puts $B$ at $(-375,375)$. Thus the shortest distance for the fly to travel is along segment $AB$ in the sector, which gives a distance $\\sqrt{(-375-125)^2+(375-0)^2}=125\\sqrt{4^2+3^2}=\\boxed{625}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two skaters, Allie and Billie, are at points $A$ and $B$, respectively, on a flat, frozen lake. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is $100$ meters. Allie leaves $A$ and skates at a speed of $8$ meters per second on a straight line that makes a $60^\\circ$ angle with $AB$. At the same time Allie leaves $A$, Billie leaves $B$ at a speed of $7$ meters per second and follows the straight path that produces the earliest possible meeting of the two skaters, given their speeds. How many meters does Allie skate before meeting Billie?\n[asy] pointpen=black; pathpen=black+linewidth(0.7);  pair A=(0,0),B=(10,0),C=6*expi(pi/3); D(B--A); D(A--C,EndArrow); MP(\"A\",A,SW);MP(\"B\",B,SE);MP(\"60^{\\circ}\",A+(0.3,0),NE);MP(\"100\",(A+B)/2); [/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label the point of intersection as $C$. Since $d = rt$, $AC = 8t$ and $BC = 7t$. According to the law of cosines,\n[asy] pointpen=black; pathpen=black+linewidth(0.7);  pair A=(0,0),B=(10,0),C=16*expi(pi/3); D(B--A); D(A--C); D(B--C,dashed); MP(\"A\",A,SW);MP(\"B\",B,SE);MP(\"C\",C,N);MP(\"60^{\\circ}\",A+(0.3,0),NE);MP(\"100\",(A+B)/2);MP(\"8t\",(A+C)/2,NW);MP(\"7t\",(B+C)/2,NE); [/asy]\n\\begin{align*}(7t)^2 &= (8t)^2 + 100^2 - 2 \\cdot 8t \\cdot 100 \\cdot \\cos 60^\\circ\\\\ 0 &= 15t^2 - 800t + 10000 = 3t^2 - 160t + 2000\\\\ t &= \\frac{160 \\pm \\sqrt{160^2 - 4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2000}}{6} = 20, \\frac{100}{3}.\\end{align*}\nSince we are looking for the earliest possible intersection, $20$ seconds are needed. Thus, $8 \\cdot 20 = \\boxed{160}$ meters is the solution.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A fly is on the edge of a ceiling of a circular room with a radius of 58 feet. The fly walks straight across the ceiling to the opposite edge, passing through the center of the circle. It then walks straight to another point on the edge of the circle but not back through the center. The third part of the journey is straight back to the original starting point. If the third part of the journey was 80 feet long, how many total feet did the fly travel over the course of all three parts?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The fly's journey traces out the three sides of triangle.  Because one side of this triangle is a diameter of the circular ceiling and the other two sides are chords of this circle, the triangle is a right triangle. If the radius of the circular room is 58 feet, then the diameter is $2 \\times 58 = 116$ feet. This is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. One of the legs is 80 feet, so the other leg must be equal to $\\sqrt{116^2 - 80^2} = \\sqrt{(13{,}456 - 6400)} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84$ feet. The total distance traveled by the fly is $116 + 84 + 80 = \\boxed{280}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Six boys stood equally spaced on a circle of radius 40 feet. Each boy walked to all of the other non-adjacent persons on the circle, shook their hands and then returned to his original spot on the circle before the next boy started his trip to shake hands with all of the other non-adjacent boys on the circle. After all six boys had done this, what is the least distance in feet that could have been traveled? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The thicker solid line in the diagram shows the shortest path that one person could travel. The circle is equally divided into six 60-degree arcs, so the short distance is 40 feet, the same as a radius. The dotted line is a diameter that separates the quadrilateral into two 30-60-90 triangles. The longer leg is $(80\\sqrt {3})/2$, or $40\\sqrt{3}$ feet. Each person travels $40\\sqrt{3} + 40 + 40 + 40\\sqrt{3} = 80 + 80\\sqrt{3}$ feet. After all six people did this, $6(80 + 80\\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{480 + 480\\sqrt{3}\\text{ feet}}$ had been traveled.

[asy]\npair A = (0,1); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (1,0);\npath q = B--A..dir(45)..C--cycle;\ndraw( (-0.5, 0)--(2.5, 0), linewidth(2) );\nfilldraw( q, gray, linewidth(2) );\ndraw(rotate(-90, (1,0))*q, dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N); label(\"$B$\", B, S); label(\"$C$\", C, S);\n[/asy] In this phase, point $B$ is always $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ cm away from point $C$, so its path is a quarter-circle with radius $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$. The circumference of a circle with radius $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ is $2\\pi(\\frac{2}{\\pi}) = 4$, so $B$ travels $\\frac{1}{4}(4) = 1$ cm.\n\nPhase 3: The quarter circle rolls along arc $CA$. [asy]\npair A = (1,0); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (0,-1);\npath q = B--A..dir(-45)..C--cycle;\ndraw( (-0.5, -1)--(2.07, -1), linewidth(2) );\nfilldraw( q, gray, linewidth(2) );\ndraw(shift((1.57,0))*rotate(-90)*q, dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N); label(\"$B$\", B, N); label(\"$C$\", C, S);\n[/asy] In this phase, $B$ is always $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ away from the ground, so its path is a straight line segment parallel to the ground. From the diagram, we see the length of this line segment is equal to the distance between the original position of $C$ and the new position of $A$. This distance is traced out by arc $CA$ as it rolls. So its length is the length of arc $CA$, which is 1 cm (since it's a quarter of a circle with radius $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$, a length we've already calculated). So the path of $B$ has length 1 cm.\n\nPhase 4: The quarter circle pivots $90^\\circ$ about point $A$. [asy]\npair A = (0,-1); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (-1,0);\npath q = B--A..dir(-135)..C--cycle;\ndraw( (-1.5, -1)--(1.5, -1), linewidth(2) );\nfilldraw( q, gray, linewidth(2) );\ndraw(rotate(-90, (0,-1))*q, dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, S); label(\"$B$\", B, N); label(\"$C$\", C, N);\n[/asy] As in phase 2, the path of $B$ has length 1 cm.\n\nPutting this together, the path of point $B$ has total length $1 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{3\\text{ cm}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A park is in the shape of a regular hexagon $2$ km on a side. Starting at a corner, Alice walks along the perimeter of the park for a distance of $5$ km. How many kilometers is she from her starting point?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\sqrt{13}\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{14}\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ \\sqrt{15}\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\sqrt{16}\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\sqrt{17}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We imagine this problem on a coordinate plane and let Alice's starting position be the origin. We see that she will travel along two edges and then go halfway along a third. Therefore, her new $x$-coordinate will be $1 + 2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$ because she travels along a distance of $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1$ km because of the side relationships of an equilateral triangle, then $2$ km because the line is parallel to the $x$-axis, and the remaining distance is $\\frac{1}{2}$ km because she went halfway along and because of the logic for the first part of her route. For her $y$-coordinate, we can use similar logic to find that the coordinate is $\\sqrt{3} + 0 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} =  \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, her distance is\\[\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{49}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{52}{4}} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The rules for a race require that all runners start at $A$, touch any part of the 1200-meter wall, and stop at $B$.

Reflect $B$ across the wall to $B'$.  Since $CB=CB'$, minimizing $AC+CB$ is equivalent to minimizing $AC+CB'$.  The wall is between $A$ and $B'$, so we may choose $C$ on line segment $AB'$.  This choice minimizes $AC+CB'$, because the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. By the Pythagorean theorem, $AB'=\\sqrt{1200^2+(300+500)^2}=400\\sqrt{13}$ meters, which to the nearest meter is $\\boxed{1442}$ meters.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport olympiad;\n\nimport geometry;\n\nsize(250);\n\ndotfactor=4;\n\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\n\ndraw((0,3)--origin--(12,0)--(12,5));\n\nlabel(\"300 m\",(0,3)--origin,W);\n\nlabel(\"500 m\",(12,0)--(12,5),E);\n\ndraw((0,3)--(6,0)--(12,5),dashed+linewidth(0.7));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,3),N); label(\"$B$\",(12,5),N);\n\ndraw(reflect((0,0),(12,0))*((6,0)--(12,5)),dashed+linewidth(0.7)); draw(reflect((0,0),(12,0))*((12,5)--(12,0)));\n\nlabel(\"$B'$\",reflect((0,0),(12,0))*(12,5),S);\n\ndot(\"$C$\",(6,0),unit((-5,-6))); draw(\"1200\n\nm\",(0,-6.5)--(12,-6.5),Bars);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Jenny and Kenny are walking in the same direction, Kenny at 3 feet per second and Jenny at 1 foot per second, on parallel paths that are 200 feet apart. A tall circular building 100 feet in diameter is centered midway between the paths. At the instant when the building first blocks the line of sight between Jenny and Kenny, they are 200 feet apart. Let $t\\,$ be the amount of time, in seconds, before Jenny and Kenny can see each other again. If $t\\,$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Consider the unit cicle of radius 50. Assume that they start at points $(-50,100)$ and $(-50,-100).$ Then at time $t$, they end up at points $(-50+t,100)$ and $(-50+3t,-100).$ The equation of the line connecting these points and the equation of the circle are\\begin{align}y&=-\\frac{100}{t}x+200-\\frac{5000}{t}\\\\50^2&=x^2+y^2\\end{align}.When they see each other again, the line connecting the two points will be tangent to the circle at the point $(x,y).$ Since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent we get\\[-\\frac{x}{y}=-\\frac{100}{t}\\]or $xt=100y.$ Now substitute\\[y= \\frac{xt}{100}\\]into $(2)$ and get\\[x=\\frac{5000}{\\sqrt{100^2+t^2}}.\\]Now substitute this and\\[y=\\frac{xt}{100}\\]into $(1)$ and solve for $t$ to get\\[t=\\frac{160}{3}.\\]Finally, the sum of the numerator and denominator is $160+3=\\boxed{163}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the middle of a vast prairie, a firetruck is stationed at the intersection of two perpendicular straight highways.

Draw a line tangent to it at $A$ and passing through $B (5,0)$. By the Pythagorean Theorem $AB^2+AO^2=OB^2 \\Longrightarrow AB=\\sqrt{OB^2-AO^2}=\\sqrt{5^2-1.4^2}=\\frac{24}{5}$. Then $\\tan(\\angle ABO)=\\frac{OA}{AB}=\\frac{7}{24}$, so the slope of line $AB$ is $\\frac{-7}{24}$. Since it passes through $(5,0)$ its equation is $y=\\frac{-7}{24}(x-5)$.\nThis line and the x and y axis bound the region the truck can go if it moves in the positive x direction. Similarly, the line $y=5-\\frac{24}{7}x$ bounds the region the truck can go if it moves in positive y direction. The intersection of these two lines is $\\left(\\frac{35}{31},\\frac{35}{31}\\right)$. The bounded region in Quadrant I is made up of a square and two triangles. $A=x^2+x(5-x)=5x$. By symmetry, the regions in the other quadrants are the same, so the area of the whole region is $20x=\\frac{700}{31}$ so the answer is $700+31=\\boxed{731}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Billy is hiking in Colorado.
