    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of the interior region formed by the lines $y = 2x - 4, y = -3x +16$ and the $y$-axis?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To find the vertices of the triangle, we find where the two lines $y=2x-4$ and $y=-3x+16$ intersect. Solving $2x-4=-3x+16$, we get $x=4$.  Substituting $x=4$ back into $y=2x-4$, we find $y=4$.  Therefore, $(4,4)$ is one of the vertices of the triangle.  The other two vertices are the $y$-intercepts of the two lines, namely $(0,16)$ and $(0,-4)$.  Taking the side joining $(0,16)$ and $(0,-4)$ as the base of the triangle, we find that the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(16-(-4))(4)=\\boxed{40}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(3mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=4;\n\nfill((0,-4)--(0,16)--(4,4)--cycle,gray);\n\ndraw((-2,0)--(5,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-5)--(0,18),Arrows(4));\n\ndraw((0,-4)--(4,4));\ndraw((0,16)--(4,4)); [/asy]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area of the portion of the circle defined by $x^2-12x+y^2=28$ that lies above the $x$-axis and to the right of the line $y=6-x$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Completing the square, the equation of the circle can be rewritten in the form \\[\n(x^2-12x +36) +y^2=64,\n\\]or $(x-6)^2 +y^2 =8^2.$ The center of this circle is $(6,0)$, so both the $x$-axis and the line $y=6-x$ pass through the center of the circle: [asy]\nsize(8cm);\nvoid axes(real x0, real x1, real y0, real y1)\n{\n    draw((x0,0)--(x1,0),EndArrow);\n    draw((0,y0)--(0,y1),EndArrow);\n    label(\"$x$\",(x1,0),E);\n    label(\"$y$\",(0,y1),N);\n    for (int i=floor(x0)+1; i<x1; ++i)\n        draw((i,.1)--(i,-.1));\n    for (int i=floor(y0)+1; i<y1; ++i)\n        draw((.1,i)--(-.1,i));\n}\nvoid e(real a, real b, real h, real k)\n{\n    draw(shift((h,k))*scale(a,b)*unitcircle);\n}\nfilldraw(arc((6,0),8,0,135)--(6-4*sqrt(2),4*sqrt(2))--(6,0)--cycle,rgb(0.8,0.8,0.8));\naxes(-5,18,-10,10);\ne(8, 8, 6, 0);\nreal f(real x) { return 6-x; }\ndraw(graph(f,-3,14),Arrows);\ndot((6,0));\nlabel(\"$y=6-x$\",(14,-8),E);\nlabel(\"$(6,0)$\",(6,0),dir(235)*1.3);\n[/asy] Since the line $y=6-x$ has slope $-1,$ it makes an angle of $135^\\circ$ with the positive $x-$axis, so the desired region makes up $\\frac{135^\\circ}{360^\\circ} = \\frac{3}{8}$ of the circle.  The radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{64} = 8$, so the circle has area $8^2\\pi = 64\\pi$. Therefore, the desired area is $64\\pi\\cdot\\frac{3}{8}=\\boxed{24 \\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area of the triangle bounded by the lines $y=x,$ $y=-x,$ and $y=6$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(200); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nxlimits(-8,8); ylimits(-1,10);\nxaxis(Label(\"$x$\"),-8,8,EndArrow(size=5));\nyaxis(Label(\"$y$\"),-2,8,EndArrow(size=5));\ndot(\"$A(6,6)$\",(6,6)); dot(\"$B(-6,6)$\",(-6,6),W); dot(\"$O$\",(0,0),SW);\ndraw((0,0) -- (6,6));\ndraw((0,0) -- (-6,6));\ndraw((-6,6)--(6,6));\n[/asy]\nLet $O = (0,0)$, and let $A$ and $B$ denote the points where $y=6$ intersects $y=x$ and $y=-x,$ respectively. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(6, 6)$ and $(-6, 6),$ respectively, so $AB = 6 - (-6) = 12.$ Also, the length of the altitude from $O$ to $AB$ is $6.$ Thus the area of $\\triangle OAB$ is\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 12 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{36}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A line with slope of $-2$ intersects the positive $x$-axis at $A$ and the positive $y$-axis at $B$. A second line intersects the $x$-axis at $C(8,0)$ and the $y$-axis at $D$. The lines intersect at $E(4,4)$. What is the area of the shaded quadrilateral $OBEC$? [asy]\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,13));\ndraw((-1,0)--(10,0));\n\nfill((0,0)--(0,8)--(8,0)--cycle,gray);\nfill((0,0)--(0,12)--(6,0)--cycle,gray);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,12)--(6,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,8)--(8,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"O\",(0,0),SE);\nlabel(\"A\",(6,0),S);\nlabel(\"C(8,0)\",(9.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"E(4,4)\",(4,4),NE);\nlabel(\"B\",(0,12),W);\nlabel(\"D\",(0,8),W);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we can create a square with the points $O$ and $E$ as opposite corners. Label the other two points as $X$ and $Y$ with $X$ on $OC$ and $Y$ on $OB$. We get that $X$ is $(4,0)$ and $Y$ is $(0,4)$.\n\nWe can find the area of the figure by finding the area of the square and the two triangles created.\n\nThe area of the square is $4 \\cdot 4 =16.$\n\nThe two triangles are right triangles. The first one, $XCE$, has legs $XC$ and $XE$ of length $4$, so the area is $\\frac{4 \\cdot 4}{2}=8$.\nTo find the area of the other triangle, we must find the coordinates of $B (0,y)$. The slope of $BE$ is of slope $-2$. Therefore, $\\frac{y-4}{0-4}=-2$.\n\nSolving for $y$, we get $y=12.$ Then, the leg of the second triangle $BY$ is $12-4=8$. The area of the triangle $YEB$ is thus $\\frac{8 \\cdot 4}{2}=16.$\n\nAdding the areas of the three areas together, $16+16+8=\\boxed{40}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area enclosed by the graph of $|x| + |2y|$ = 10 shown here?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,-10)--(0,10),Arrows);\ndraw((-15,0)--(15,0),Arrows);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,10),NE);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(15,0),SE);\ndraw((10,0)--(0,5)--(-10,0)--(0,-5)--cycle);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The x and y axis of this graph break it down into four triangles each with the same area. We find that the x and y intercepts of this graph are $(0,5)$, $(0,-5)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$. This means that the area of each triangle is $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot5\\cdot10=25.$$ Therefore, the total area is $4\\cdot25=\\boxed{100}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle whose vertices are at $(4, -1)$, $(10, 3)$ and $(4, 5)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$.  Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Regions I, II and III are bounded by squares. The perimeter of region I is 12 units and the perimeter of region II is 24 units. What is the ratio of the area of region I to the area of region III? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--(0,0)--cycle,linewidth(2));\ndraw((9,0)--(15,0)--(15,6)--(9,6)--(9,0)--cycle,linewidth(2));\ndraw((9,6)--(12,6)--(12,9)--(9,9)--cycle,linewidth(2));\nlabel(\"III\",(4.5,4.5));\nlabel(\"II\",(12,3));\nlabel(\"I\",(10.5,7.5));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A side of square I has length 3, while a side of square II has length 6 (all sides have equal length).  Therefore, a side of square III has length 9.  Since the side length of square I is $\\frac{1}{3}$ that of square III, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their side lengths, the ratio of the area of square I to square III is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9}$.   Alternately, you can just calculate the areas: square I has an area of 9, square III has an area of 81, thus, the ratio of their areas is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangular region is enclosed by the lines with equations $y = \\frac{1}{2} x + 3$, $y = -2x + 6$ and $y = 1$. What is the area of the triangular region? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The vertices of the triangle are the points where two of the lines intersect. The line  $y=\\frac{1}{2}x+3$ intersects $y=1$ when  $$\\frac{1}{2}x+3=1\\Rightarrow x=-4.$$ The line $y=-2x+6$ intersects $y=1$ when  $$-2x+6=1\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{5}{2}.$$  The line $y=\\frac{1}{2}x+3$ intersects $y=-2x+6$ when  $$\\frac{1}{2}x+3=-2x+6\\Rightarrow x=\\frac{6}{5}.$$ and  $$y=-2\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right)+6=\\frac{18}{5}$$\n\nThus the vertices of the triangle are $(-4,1)$, $\\left(\\frac{5}{2},1\\right)$, and $\\left(\\frac{6}{5},\\frac{18}{5}\\right)$. We can let the base of the triangle lie along the line $y=1$.  It will have length  $$4+\\frac{5}{2}=\\frac{13}{2}.$$  The altitude from $\\left(\\frac{6}{5},\\frac{18}{5}\\right)$ to this line will have length  $$\\frac{18}{5}-1=\\frac{13}{5}.$$ Thus the area of the triangle is $$\\frac{1}{2}*\\frac{13}{2}*\\frac{13}{5}=\\frac{169}{20}=\\boxed{8.45}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of square units in the area of trapezoid ABCD with vertices A(0,0), B(0,-2), C(4,0), and D(4,6)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plot the plots and observe that the bases of the trapezoid are $AB$ and $CD$.  The area of the trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the bases times the height: $\\frac{1}{2}(AB+CD)(AC)=\\frac{1}{2}(2+6)(4)=\\boxed{16}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\npair A=(0,0), B=(0,-2), C=(4,0), D=(4,6);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\nxaxis(-3,8,Arrows(4));\nyaxis(-3,8,Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Three coplanar squares with sides of lengths two, four and six units, respectively, are arranged side-by-side, as shown so that one side of each square lies on line $AB$ and a segment connects the bottom left corner of the smallest square to the upper right corner of the largest square.

Since all three triangles share an angle, it follows that they must be similar. Notice that the base of $T_3$ is equal to $2+4+6 = 12$, and its height is equal to $6$. This, the height-to-base ratio of each of $T_1$ and $T_2$ is equal to $6/12 = 1/2$. Since the base of $T_1$ is $2$ and the base of $T_2$ is $2+4 = 6$, it follows that their heights are, respectively, $2 \\cdot (1/2) = 1$ and $6 \\cdot (1/2) = 3$. The shaded region is a trapezoid with bases $1$ and $3$ and altitude $4$, and area $\\frac{4(1+3)}{2} = \\boxed{8}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of the interior region formed by the lines $y = 4x - 6, y = -2x +12$ and the $y$-axis?\n\nAnswer:\n",
