Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The side length of the regular hexagon is 10 cm. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the shaded region? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\n\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\nfill(B--C--E--F--cycle,heavycyan);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label points $A$, $B$, $C$ as shown below, and let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$. [asy]\n\nsize(120);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\nfill(B--C--E--F--cycle,heavycyan); pair H=(E+C)/2; draw(D--H); draw(E--C); label(\"$A$\",C,NW);label(\"$B$\",D,W);label(\"$C$\",E,SW);label(\"$H$\",H,ESE);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy] Since the hexagon is regular, $\\angle ABC = 120^\\circ$ and $\\angle ABH = \\angle CBH = 120^\\circ / 2 = 60^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\triangle ABH$ and $\\triangle CBH$ are congruent $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangles.  These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince $AB=BC=10$, we have $BH = AB/2 = 5$ and $AH = CH = \\sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $BH$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $AC = 2\\cdot 5\\sqrt{3} = 10\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe shaded region is a rectangle with base length $10$ and height length $10\\sqrt{3}$; its area is $10\\cdot 10\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{100\\sqrt{3}}$ square cm.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the number of units in the length of diagonal $DA$ of the regular hexagon shown. Express your answer in simplest radical form.

Thus, $\\triangle AXY$ and $\\triangle DXY$ are congruent $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangles.  These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince the side length of the hexagon is 10, we have $AX=XD=10$.  It follows that $XY = AX/2 = 5$ and $AY = DY = \\sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $XY$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $DA = 2\\cdot 5\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{10\\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The figure shows a square in the interior of a regular hexagon.  The square and regular hexagon share a common side. What is the degree measure of $\\angle ABC$? [asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;\nA=(0,.866);\nB=(.5,1.732);\nC=(1.5,1.732);\nD=(2,.866);\nE=(1.5,0);\nF=(.5,0);\nG=(.5,1);\nH=(1.5,1);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--E);\ndraw(E--F);\ndraw(F--A);\ndraw(F--G);\ndraw(G--H);\ndraw(H--E);\ndraw(D--H);\nlabel(\"A\", C, N);\nlabel(\"B\", D, E);\nlabel(\"C\", H, N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label the lower right corner of the square point $D$ and the lower left corner $E$. The interior angles of a regular hexagon are 120 degrees and the interior angles of a square are 90 degrees. Thus, $m\\angle BDC=m \\angle BDE - m\\angle CDE=120^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 30^\\circ$. In addition, because the square and regular hexagon share a side and all of their sides have the same length, segments $CD$ and $BD$ have the same length. Thus, triangle $BCD$ is isosceles.\n\nBecause the base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent, $m\\angle BCD = m \\angle CBD=x$. In addition, because the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have  \\begin{align*}\n180^\\circ &= m\\angle BDC+m\\angle BCD + m\\angle CBD \\\\\n&=30^\\circ + x + x \\\\\n150^\\circ &= 2x \\\\\n75^\\circ = x\n\\end{align*} Thus, $m\\angle CBD=75^\\circ$. Finally, we calculate $m\\angle ABC=m\\angle ABD- m\\angle CBD=120^\\circ-75^\\circ=\\boxed{45}^\\circ$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular hexagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 2 units. In square units, what is the area of the hexagon? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect opposite pairs of vertices of the regular hexagon with line segments as shown.  Since each angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees, the six triangles produced are equilateral.  The diameter of the circle circumscribed around the hexagon is equal to twice the side length of each of the triangles.  Therefore, each triangle has side length 2 units.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ units is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$ square units.  (To show this, divide the equilateral triangle into two smaller 30-60-90 triangles.)  Substituting $s=2$, we find that the area of each triangle is $\\sqrt{3}$ square units.  Therefore, area of the hexagon is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(3.5cm);\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\n\nfor(i=0;i<=5;i=i+1)\n\n{\n\ndot((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\ndraw((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6))--(cos(2*pi*(i+1)/6),sin(2*pi*(i+1)/6)));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\n}\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The midpoints of the sides of a regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ are joined to form a smaller hexagon.

Then, since $\\angle ROS=60^\\circ$, quadrilateral  $ORES$ encloses $1/6$ of the area of  $ABCDEF$, $\\triangle ORS$  encloses $1/6$  of the area of the smaller hexagon, and $\\triangle ORS$ is equilateral. Let $T$ be the center of $\\triangle ORS$. Then triangles $TOR$, $TRS$, and $TSO$ are congruent isosceles  triangles with largest angle $120^\\circ$. Triangle $ERS$ is an isosceles triangle with largest angle $120^\\circ$ and a side in common with $\\triangle TRS$, so $ORES$ is partitioned into four congruent triangles, exactly three of which form $\\triangle ORS$. Since the ratio of the area enclosed by the small regular hexagon to the area of $ABCDEF$ is the same as the ratio of the area enclosed by $\\triangle ORS$ to the area enclosed by $ORES$, the ratio is $\\boxed{\\frac{3}{4}}$.

Since $\\triangle ABG$ consists of two small triangles, $[\\triangle ABG]= 2K$.  Similarly, $\\triangle ACE$ is built from six small triangles, so $[\\triangle ACE] = 6K$.  Hence the ratio of these areas is $2K/6K = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $A = (0,0)$ and $B = (b,2)$ be points on the coordinate plane. Let $ABCDEF$ be a convex equilateral hexagon such that $\\angle FAB = 120^\\circ,$ $\\overline{AB}\\parallel \\overline{DE},$ $\\overline{BC}\\parallel \\overline{EF,}$ $\\overline{CD}\\parallel \\overline{FA},$ and the y-coordinates of its vertices are distinct elements of the set $\\{0,2,4,6,8,10\\}.$ The area of the hexagon can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and n is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The y-coordinate of $F$ must be $4$. All other cases yield non-convex and/or degenerate hexagons, which violate the problem statement.\nLetting $F = (f,4)$, and knowing that $\\angle FAB = 120^\\circ$, we can use rewrite $F$ using complex numbers: $f + 4 i = (b + 2 i)\\left(e^{i(2 \\pi / 3)}\\right) = (b + 2 i)\\left(-1/2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i\\right) = -\\frac{b}{2}-\\sqrt{3}+\\left(\\frac{b\\sqrt{3}}{2}-1\\right)i$. We solve for $b$ and $f$ and find that $F = \\left(-\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}, 4\\right)$ and that $B = \\left(\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}}, 2\\right)$.\nThe area of the hexagon can then be found as the sum of the areas of two congruent triangles ($EFA$ and $BCD$, with height $8$ and base $\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}$) and a parallelogram ($ABDE$, with height $8$ and base $\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}}$).\n$A = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}} + 8 \\times \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{144}{\\sqrt{3}} = 48\\sqrt{3}$.\nThus, $m+n = \\boxed{51}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of square units in the area of the hexagon below?\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor = 4;\nint i,j;\nfor(i=0;i<=4;++i)\n\n{\n\nfor(j=-3;j<=3;++j)\n\n{\n\ndot((i,j));\n\n}\n\n}\n\nfor(i=1;i<=4;++i)\n\n{\n\ndraw((i,-1/3)--(i,1/3));\n\n}\nfor(j=1;j<=3;++j)\n\n{\n\ndraw((-1/3,j)--(1/3,j));\n\ndraw((-1/3,-j)--(1/3,-j));\n\n}\n\nreal eps = 0.2;\n\ndraw((3,3.5+eps)--(3,3.5-eps));\ndraw((4,3.5+eps)--(4,3.5-eps));\ndraw((3,3.5)--(4,3.5));\n\nlabel(\"1 unit\",(3.5,4));\n\ndraw((4.5-eps,2)--(4.5+eps,2));\ndraw((4.5-eps,3)--(4.5+eps,3));\ndraw((4.5,2)--(4.5,3));\n\nlabel(\"1 unit\",(5.2,2.5));\n\ndraw((-1,0)--(5,0));\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,4));\ndraw((0,0)--(1,3)--(3,3)--(4,0)--(3,-3)--(1,-3)--cycle,linewidth(2));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each of the four shaded triangles in the diagram below has area $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(3)=\\frac{3}{2}$ square units, and the shaded triangles along with the hexagon form a rectangular region whose area is $6\\cdot4=24$ square units.

Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that since the area is $\\pi r^2 = 324 \\pi$, where $r$ is the radius, we must have $r=\\sqrt{324}=18$. Thus the distance from the center of the hexagon to a vertex is $18$, and we can break up the hexagon into $6$ equilateral triangles, each of which has side length $18$. The area of an equilateral triangle of side length $s$ is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$, so the area of each equilateral triangle is $81 \\sqrt{3}$, making the total $6(81 \\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{486 \\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A wire is cut into two pieces, one of length $a$ and the other of length $b$. The piece of length $a$ is bent to form an equilateral triangle, and the piece of length $b$ is bent to form a regular hexagon. The triangle and the hexagon have equal area. What is $\\frac{a}{b}$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The side length of the triangle and hexagon are $\\frac{a}{3}$ and $\\frac{b}{6},$ respectively, so their areas are \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\left(\\frac{a}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a^2 \\sqrt3}{36} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{3\\sqrt3}{2} \\left(\\frac{b}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{b^2\\sqrt3}{24},\\]respectively. Therefore, we have \\[\\frac{a^2\\sqrt3}{36} = \\frac{b^2\\sqrt3}{24},\\]so \\[\\frac{a^2}{b^2} = \\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{3}{2}.\\]Taking the square root of both sides, we get \\[\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{\\sqrt3}{\\sqrt2} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt6}2}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n By joining alternate vertices of a regular hexagon with edges $4$ inches long, two equilateral triangles are formed, as shown.
