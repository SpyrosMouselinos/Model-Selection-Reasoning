Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ is the base of pyramid $PABCD$.

Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ is the base of pyramid $PABCD$.

To find this length, consider right triangle $PAB$.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem gives $PA = \\sqrt{PB^2 - AB^2} = 15$.\n\nThe area of the base is $[ABCD] = (AB)(BC) = 32$, so the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac13(32)(15) = \\boxed{160}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The rectangle $ABCD$ below has dimensions $AB = 12 \\sqrt{3}$ and $BC = 13 \\sqrt{3}$.

We set points $C$ and $D$ as $(6\\sqrt {3}, 0, 0)$ and $( - 6\\sqrt {3}, 0, 0)$, respectively. Using Pythagoras, we find $A$ as $(0, \\sqrt {399}, 0)$. We know that the vertex of the tetrahedron ($P$) has to be of the form $(x, y, z)$, where $z$ is the altitude of the tetrahedron. Since the distance from $P$ to points $A$, $B$, and $C$ is $\\frac {\\sqrt {939}}{2}$, we can write three equations using the distance formula:\n\\begin{align*} x^{2} + (y - \\sqrt {399})^{2} + z^{2} &= \\frac {939}{4}\\\\ (x - 6\\sqrt {3})^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} &= \\frac {939}{4}\\\\ (x + 6\\sqrt {3})^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} &= \\frac {939}{4} \\end{align*}\nSubtracting the last two equations, we get $x = 0$. Solving for $y,z$ with a bit of effort, we eventually get $x = 0$, $y = \\frac {291}{2\\sqrt {399}}$, $z = \\frac {99}{\\sqrt {133}}$. Since the area of a triangle is $\\frac {1}{2}\\cdot bh$, we have the base area as $18\\sqrt {133}$. Thus, the volume is $V = \\frac {1}{3}\\cdot18\\sqrt {133}\\cdot\\frac {99}{\\sqrt {133}} = 6\\cdot99 = \\boxed{594}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid is formed on a $6\\times 8$ rectangular base. The four edges joining the apex to the corners of the rectangular base each have length $13$. What is the volume of the pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know the rectangular base of the pyramid has area $48$. To find the volume, we must also determine the height.\n\nLet the rectangular base be $ABCD$. Let the apex of the pyramid be $X$, and let $O$ be the foot of the perpendicular drawn from $X$ to face $ABCD$: [asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport three;\ntriple A = (-3,-4,0);\ntriple B = (-3,4,0);\ntriple C = (3,4,0);\ntriple D = (3,-4,0);\ntriple O = (0,0,0);\ntriple X = (0,0,12);\ndraw(B--C--D--A--B--X--D);\ndraw(X--C); draw(A--X--O--D,dashed);\ndot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(O); dot(X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,W);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,ESE);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,N);\ndraw(O+(X-O)/19.2--O+(X-O)/19.2+(D-O)/8--O+(D-O)/8);\n[/asy] Then by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\begin{align*}\n13^2 &= OX^2+OA^2 = OX^2+OB^2 \\\\\n&= OX^2+OC^2 = OX^2+OD^2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $OA=OB=OC=OD$, so $O$ must be the center of the rectangle (where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet). This is also the point where the diagonals of $ABCD$ bisect each other. Each diagonal of $ABCD$ has length $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$, so we have $OA=OB=OC=OD=5$.\n\nThus $OX=\\sqrt{13^2-OD^2} = \\sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$, and so the height of the pyramid is $12$. The volume is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac 13\\cdot (\\text{area of base})\\cdot (\\text{height}) &= \\frac 13\\cdot 48\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= 16\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{192}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Consider the paper triangle whose vertices are $(0,0), (34,0),$ and $(16,24).$ The vertices of its midpoint triangle are the midpoints of its sides.

Suppose $P$ is the apex of the tetrahedron, and let $O$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to $\\triangle ABC$. The crux of this problem is the following lemma.\nLemma: The point $O$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nProof. Observe that\\[OF^2 - OE^2 = PF^2 - PE^2 = AF^2 - AE^2;\\]the first equality follows by the Pythagorean Theorem, while the second follows from $AF = FP$ and $AE = EP$. Thus, by the Perpendicularity Lemma, $AO$ is perpendicular to $FE$ and hence $BC$. Analogously, $O$ lies on the $B$-altitude and $C$-altitude of $\\triangle ABC$, and so $O$ is, indeed, the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nTo find the coordinates of $O$, we need to find the intersection point of altitudes $BE$ and $AD$. The equation of $BE$ is simply $x=16$. $AD$ is perpendicular to line $BC$, so the slope of $AD$ is equal to the negative reciprocal of the slope of $BC$. $BC$ has slope $\\frac{24-0}{16-34}=-\\frac{4}{3}$, therefore $y=\\frac{3}{4} x$. These two lines intersect at $(16,12)$, so that's the base of the height of the tetrahedron.\nLet $S$ be the foot of altitude $BS$ in $\\triangle BPQ$. From the Pythagorean Theorem, $h=\\sqrt{BS^2-SO^2}$. However, since $S$ and $O$ are, by coincidence, the same point, $SO=0$ and $h=12$.\nThe area of the base is $102$, so the volume is $\\frac{102*12}{3}=\\boxed{408}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $T$ are in space such that each of $\\overline{TA}$, $\\overline{TB}$, and $\\overline{TC}$ is perpendicular to the other two.  If $TA = TB = 10$ and $TC = 9$, then what is the volume of pyramid $TABC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (4,8,0);\ntriple B= (4,0,0);\ntriple C = (0,0,0);\ntriple D = (0,8,0);\ntriple P = (4,8,6);\ndraw(B--P--D--A--B);\ndraw(A--P);\ndraw(B--D,dashed);\nlabel(\"$T$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$A$\",P,N);\n[/asy]\n\nWe can think of $TAB$ as the base of the pyramid, and $\\overline{CT}$ as the height from apex $C$ to the base, since $\\overline{CT}$ is perpendicular to face $ABT$.  The area of right triangle $ABT$ is $(10)(10)/2 = 50$ square units, so the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac13([ABT])(CT) = \\frac13(50)(9) = \\boxed{150}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ is the base of right pyramid $\\allowbreak PABCDEF$.  If $PAD$ is an equilateral triangle with side length 8, then what is the volume of the pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (1,0,0);\ntriple B = (0.5,sqrt(3)/2,0);\ntriple C = (-0.5,sqrt(3)/2,0);\ntriple D = (-1,0,0);\ntriple EE = (-0.5,-sqrt(3)/2,0);\ntriple F = (0.5,-sqrt(3)/2,0);\n\ntriple P = (0,0,1);\n\ndraw(F--A--B--C);\ndraw(C--D--EE--F,dashed);\ndraw(A--P--C);\ndraw(EE--P--D,dashed);\ndraw(B--P--F);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\nlabel(\"$E$\",EE,S);\ndraw(A--D,dashed);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,W);\ndraw(EE--B,dashed);\ndraw(C--F,dashed);\ntriple O = (0,0,0);\ndraw(P--O,dashed);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,S);\n[/asy]\n\nDrawing the long diagonals of a regular hexagon divides the hexagon into equilateral triangles with side length equal to half the length of each long diagonal.  So, the area of the base equals 6 times the area of an equilateral triangle with side length 4.  An equilateral triangle with side length 4 has area $4^2\\sqrt{3}/4 = 4\\sqrt{3}$, so the area of the base of the pyramid is $6(4\\sqrt{3}) = 24\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nLet $O$ be the center of the hexagon, so $\\overline{PO}$ is the altitude from the apex of the pyramid.  Since triangle $PAD$ is an equilateral triangle, triangle $POA$ is a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse 8.  $\\overline{PO}$ is opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle in this triangle, so $PO = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFinally, the volume of the pyramid is  \\[\\frac13\\cdot [ABCDEF] \\cdot PO = \\frac13\\cdot 24\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 4\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{96}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid with volume 40 cubic inches has a rectangular base. If the length of the base is doubled, the width tripled and the height increased by $50\\%$, what is the volume of the new pyramid, in cubic inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the volume of a pyramid is linear in each of length, width, and height (in particular, $V = \\frac{1}{3} lwh$), multiplying any of these dimensions by a scalar multiplies the volume by the same scalar.  So the new volume is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 1.50 = 9$ times the old one, or $\\boxed{360}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid with a square base has total surface area 432 square units.  The area of each triangular face is half the area of the square face. What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $ABCD$ be the base of the pyramid and let $P$ be the pyramid's apex.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport three;\n\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\n\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\n\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\n\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\n\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\n\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\n\ndraw(P--C);\n\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\n\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\n\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\n\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\n\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\n\ndraw(P--F--M,dashed);\n\ndraw(P--M);\n\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\n\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,SW);\n\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base and $M$ be the midpoint of an edge of the square, as shown.  There are four triangular faces, each with area half the area of the square face.  So, the total surface area of the pyramid is 3 times the area of the square face.  Therefore, the area of the square face is $432/3=144$ square units, which means that each side of the square has length 12.\n\nSince the area of the triangle is half the area of the square, we have $(BC)(PM)/2 = 72$, so $(BC)(PM) = 144$, which means $PM = 144/12 = 12$.  Since $F$ is the center of the square base, we have $FM = 6$, so $PF = \\sqrt{12^2 - 6^2} = 6\\sqrt{3}$.  Finally, the volume of the pyramid is \\[\\frac{[ABCD]\\cdot PF}{3} = \\frac{144\\cdot 6\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\boxed{288\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $ABCD$, a rectangle with $AB = 12$ and $BC = 16$, is the base of pyramid $P$, which has a height of $24$. A plane parallel to $ABCD$ is passed through $P$, dividing $P$ into a frustum $F$ and a smaller pyramid $P'$. Let $X$ denote the center of the circumsphere of $F$, and let $T$ denote the apex of $P$. If the volume of $P$ is eight times that of $P'$, then the value of $XT$ can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute the value of $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n As we are dealing with volumes, the ratio of the volume of $P'$ to $P$ is the cube of the ratio of the height of $P'$ to $P$.\nThus, the height of $P$ is $\\sqrt [3]{8} = 2$ times the height of $P'$, and thus the height of each is $12$.\nThus, the top of the frustum is a rectangle $A'B'C'D'$ with $A'B' = 6$ and $B'C' = 8$.\nNow, consider the plane that contains diagonal $AC$ as well as the altitude of $P$. Taking the cross section of the frustum along this plane gives the trapezoid $ACC'A'$, inscribed in an equatorial circular section of the sphere. It suffices to consider this circle.\nFirst, we want the length of $AC$. This is given by the Pythagorean Theorem over triangle $ABC$ to be $20$. Thus, $A'C' = 10$. Since the height of this trapezoid is $12$, and $AC$ extends a distance of $5$ on either direction of $A'C'$, we can use a 5-12-13 triangle to determine that $AA' = CC' = 13$.\nNow, we wish to find a point equidistant from $A$, $A'$, and $C$. By symmetry, this point, namely $X$, must lie on the perpendicular bisector of $AC$. Let $X$ be $h$ units from $A'C'$ in $ACC'A'$. By the Pythagorean Theorem twice,\\begin{align*} 5^2 + h^2 & = r^2 \\\\ 10^2 + (12 - h)^2 & = r^2 \\end{align*}Subtracting gives $75 + 144 - 24h = 0 \\Longrightarrow h = \\frac {73}{8}$. Thus $XT = h + 12 = \\frac {169}{8}$ and $m + n = \\boxed{177}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ is the base of pyramid $PABCD$. If $AB = 3$, $BC = 2$, $\\overline{PA}\\perp \\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{PA}\\perp \\overline{AB}$, and $PC = 5$, then what is the volume of $PABCD$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
