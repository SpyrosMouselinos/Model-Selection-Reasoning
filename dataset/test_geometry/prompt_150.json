Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The truncated right circular cone has a large base radius 8 cm and a small base radius of 4 cm. The height of the truncated cone is 6 cm.

We don't know the height of the small cone, so call it $x$.  Since the small and large cone are similar, we have $x/4=(x+6)/8$; solving yields $x=6$.  Hence the small cone has radius 4, height 6, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(4^2)(6)=32\\pi$ and the large cone has radius 8, height 12, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(8^2)(12)=256\\pi$.  The frustum's volume is the difference of these two volumes, or $256\\pi-32\\pi=\\boxed{224\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn.

The ratio of the base to the height of an equilateral triangle is 1 to $\\sqrt{3}/2$. In terms of the radius, $r$, the base is $2r$ and the height is $2r\\sqrt{3}/2$, or $r\\sqrt{3}$. Since we know the volume of the cone, we can use the volume formula and solve the equation  \\[(1/3) \\times \\pi \\times r^2 \\times r\\sqrt{3} = 12288\\pi\\]  for $r$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $\\pi$ gives  $(1/3)r^3\\sqrt{3} = 12288$. Tripling both sides, we get $r^3\\sqrt{3} = 36,\\!864$. Now, we want $r\\sqrt{3},$ so we multiply both sides by $3$ to get $r^3\\cdot(\\sqrt{3})^3 = (r\\sqrt{3})^3 = 36,\\!864 \\cdot 3 = 110,\\!592.$ Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $r\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{48.0}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a cylinder is $54\\pi$ $\\text{cm}^3$. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone with the same radius and height as the cylinder? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$. [asy]\nimport solids; currentprojection=orthographic(0,100,25); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nrevolution cyl = cylinder((5,0,0),1,5,Z);\nrevolution cone = cone((0,0,0),1,5,Z);\ndraw(cyl,backpen=dashed);\ndraw(cone,backpen=dashed);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $(1/3)\\pi r^2 h$; a cylinder with the same radius and height has volume $\\pi r^2 h$.  Thus we see the volume of the corresponding cone has 1/3 the volume of the cylinder, which is $(1/3)(54\\pi = \\boxed{18\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A solid in the shape of a right circular cone is 4 inches tall and its base has a 3-inch radius. The entire surface of the cone, including its base, is painted. A plane parallel to the base of the cone divides the cone into two solids, a smaller cone-shaped solid $C$ and a frustum-shaped solid $F,$ in such a way that the ratio between the areas of the painted surfaces of $C$ and $F$ and the ratio between the volumes of $C$ and $F$ are both equal to $k$. Given that $k=\\frac m n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Our original solid has volume equal to $V = \\frac13 \\pi r^2 h = \\frac13 \\pi 3^2\\cdot 4 = 12 \\pi$ and has surface area $A = \\pi r^2 + \\pi r \\ell$, where $\\ell$ is the slant height of the cone. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we get $\\ell = 5$ and $A = 24\\pi$.\nLet $x$ denote the radius of the small cone. Let $A_c$ and $A_f$ denote the area of the painted surface on cone $C$ and frustum $F$, respectively, and let $V_c$ and $V_f$ denote the volume of cone $C$ and frustum $F$, respectively. Because the plane cut is parallel to the base of our solid, $C$ is similar to the uncut solid and so the height and slant height of cone $C$ are $\\frac{4}{3}x$ and $\\frac{5}{3}x$, respectively. Using the formula for lateral surface area of a cone, we find that $A_c=\\frac{1}{2}c\\cdot \\ell=\\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi x)\\left(\\frac{5}{3}x\\right)=\\frac{5}{3}\\pi x^2$. By subtracting $A_c$ from the surface area of the original solid, we find that $A_f=24\\pi - \\frac{5}{3}\\pi x^2$.\nNext, we can calculate $V_c=\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2h=\\frac{1}{3}\\pi x^2 \\left(\\frac{4}{3}x\\right)=\\frac{4}{9}\\pi x^3$. Finally, we subtract $V_c$ from the volume of the original cone to find that $V_f=12\\pi - \\frac{4}{9}\\pi x^3$. We know that $\\frac{A_c}{A_f}=\\frac{V_c}{V_f}=k.$ Plugging in our values for $A_c$, $A_f$, $V_c$, and $V_f$, we obtain the equation $\\frac{\\frac{5}{3}\\pi x^2}{24\\pi - \\frac{5}{3}\\pi x^2}=\\frac{\\frac{4}{9}\\pi x^3}{12\\pi - \\frac{4}{9}\\pi x^3}$. We can take reciprocals of both sides to simplify this equation to $\\frac{72}{5x^2} - 1 = \\frac{27}{x^3} - 1$ and so $x = \\frac{15}{8}$. Then $k = \\frac{\\frac{5}{3}\\pi x^2}{24\\pi - \\frac{5}{3}\\pi x^2}= \\frac{125}{387} = \\frac mn$ so the answer is $m+n=125+387=\\boxed{512}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone is sliced into four pieces by planes parallel to its base, as shown in the figure. All of these pieces have the same height. What is the ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to the volume of the largest piece? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, w, x, y, z;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(.25,.75);\nC=(.5,1.5);\nD=(.75,2.25);\nE=(1,3);\nF=(1.25,2.25);\nG=(1.5,1.5);\nH=(1.75,.75);\nI=(2,0);\nw=(A+I)/2;\nx=(B+H)/2;\ny=(C+G)/2;\nz=(D+F)/2;\ndraw(ellipse(w, 1, .25));\ndraw(ellipse(x, .75, .1875));\ndraw(ellipse(y, .5, .125));\ndraw(ellipse(z, .25, .0625));\ndraw(A--E--I);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the smallest cone (the one on top) be $h$ and let the radius of the circular base of that cone be $r$. Consider the 4 cones in the diagram: the smallest one on top (cone A), the top 2 pieces (cone B), the top 3 pieces (cone C), and all 4 pieces together (cone D). Because each piece of the large cone has the same height as the smallest cone and the same angle and vertex at the top, each of the 4 cones is a dilation of the smaller cone at the top. In other words, all four cones are similar. Because cone B has height twice that of cone A, its circular base has twice the radius as that of A. Likewise, cone C has three times the height, and thus 3 times the radius, and cone D has 4 times the height and 4 times the radius. Thus, using the formula for the volume of a cone, we get  \\begin{align*}\nV_B&=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (2r)^2 (2h)=\\frac{8}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\\\\nV_C&=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (3r)^2 (3h)=\\frac{27}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\\\\nV_D&=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (4r)^2 (4h)=\\frac{64}{3} \\pi r^2 h \n\\end{align*}Looking at the diagram, we can see that the largest piece will be the volume of cone D minus that of cone C: \\[V_{1}=\\frac{64}{3} \\pi r^2 h-\\frac{27}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{64-27}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{37}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\]Also notice that the volume of the second largest piece is the volume of cone C minus that of cone B: \\[V_{2}=\\frac{27}{3} \\pi r^2 h-\\frac{8}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{27-8}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{19}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\]Thus, the ratio of the volume of the second largest piece to that of the largest piece is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{V_2}{V_1}=\\frac{\\frac{19}{3} \\pi r^2 h}{\\frac{37}{3} \\pi r^2 h} \n=\\frac{\\frac{19}{\\cancel{3}} \\cancel{\\pi} \\cancel{r^2} \\cancel{h}}{\\frac{37}{\\cancel{3}} \\cancel{\\pi} \\cancel{r^2} \\cancel{h}} \n=\\boxed{\\frac{19}{37}}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone having a diameter of 10cm and a height of 6cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The radius of the base of the cone is $10/2 = 5$, so the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{50 \\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A truncated cone has horizontal bases with radii 18 and 2. A sphere is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surface of the truncated cone. What is the radius of the sphere?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{DC}$ be parallel diameters of the bottom and top bases, respectively. A great circle of the sphere is tangent to all four sides of trapezoid $ABCD$. Let $E,F$, and $G$ be the points of tangency on $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CD}$, respectively. Then \\[\nFB= EB= 18 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad FC= GC= 2,\n\\]so $BC=20$. If $H$ is on $\\overline{AB}$ such that $\\angle CHB$ is a right angle, then $HB= 18-2=16.$ Thus \\[\nCH=\\sqrt{20^{2}-16^{2}}=12,\n\\]and the radius of the sphere is $(1/2)(12)=\\boxed{6}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.2cm);\npair A,B,C,D,I,F,G,H;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(36,0);\nI=(18,0);\nH=(20,0);\nD=(16,12);\nC=(20,12);\nG=(18,12);\nF=(21.6,10.8);\ndot(F);\ndot(I);\ndot(G);\ndraw(Circle((18,6),6),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(G--I,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(C--H,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"2\",(19,12),N);\ndraw((20,-2)--(36,-2));\ndraw((18,-4)--(36,-4));\ndraw((20,-2.5)--(20,-1.5));\ndraw((36,-2.5)--(36,-1.5));\ndraw((18,-3.5)--(18,-4.5));\ndraw((36,-3.5)--(36,-4.5));\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 16}\",(28,-2),S);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 18}\",(27,-4),S);\nlabel(\"12\",(20,6),E);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I,S);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny $H$}\",H,SE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,NE);\nlabel(\"$G$\",G,SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The truncated right circular cone below has a large base radius 8 cm and a small base radius of 4 cm.
