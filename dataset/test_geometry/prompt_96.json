    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with angle $B$ congruent to angle $C$. The measure of angle $C$ is four times the measure of angle $A$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $B$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $x$ be the number of degrees in $\\angle A$. Then $\\angle C=4x^\\circ$, and $\\angle B$ is also $4x^\\circ$ (since $\\angle B$ is congruent to $\\angle C$).\n\nSince the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we have $$x + 4x + 4x = 180,$$ which we can solve for $x=20$. Therefore, $\\angle B = 4\\cdot 20 = \\boxed{80}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measures of angles $A$ and $B$ are both positive, integer numbers of degrees. The measure of angle $A$ is a multiple of the measure of angle $B$, and angles $A$ and $B$ are complementary angles. How many measures are possible for angle $A$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The given information tells us that $A = 90^\\circ -B$ and $A=kB$ for some $k\\ge1$.  Therefore, we have $kB = 90^\\circ - B$. This simplifies to $(k+1)B=90^\\circ$. $k+1$ can be any factor of $90$ except one, since $k+1\\ge2$. $90=2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$ has $2\\cdot3\\cdot2=12$ factors, so there are 11 possible values of $k$. Each value of $k$ uniquely determines the value of $B$ and therefore the value of $A$, so there are $\\boxed{11}$ possible measures for $A$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The angles of quadrilateral $ABCD$ satisfy  $\\angle A = 2\\angle B =\n3\\angle C = 4\\angle D$.  What is the degree measure of $\\angle A$, rounded to the nearest whole number?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $x$ be the degree measure of $\\angle A$.  Then the degree measures of angles $B$, $C$,  and $D$ are $x/2$, $x/3$, and $x/4$, respectively.  The degree measures of the four angles have a sum of 360, so \\[\n360 = x+\\frac{x}{2}+\\frac{x}{3}+\\frac{x}{4} =\n\\frac{25x}{12}.\n\\]Thus $x=(12\\cdot 360)/25 = 172.8\\approx \\boxed{173}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with angle $A$ congruent to angle $B$. The measure of angle $C$ is 30 degrees more than the measure of angle $A$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $C$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $x$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $A$.  Then angle $B$ measures $x$ degrees as well and angle $C$ measures $x+30$ degrees.  Since the sum of the interior angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we solve $x+x+x+30=180$ to find $x=50$.  Therefore, angle $C$ measures $x+30=50+30=\\boxed{80}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AX = XY = YB = BC$ and the measure of angle $ABC$ is 120 degrees. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$?\n\n[asy]\npair A,X,Y,B,C;\nX = A + dir(30); Y = X + dir(0); B = Y + dir(60); C = B + dir(-30);\ndraw(B--Y--X--B--C--A--X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$X$\",X,NW); label(\"$Y$\",Y,S); label(\"$B$\",B,N); label(\"$C$\",C,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $t$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$ (which is what we want to compute).\n\nSince $AX=XY$, we have $\\angle AYX = \\angle YAX = \\angle BAC = t^\\circ$. Then, since the sum of angles in $\\triangle AXY$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle AXY = (180-2t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AXY$ and $\\angle BXY$ add to form a straight angle, so they are supplementary; $\\angle BXY = (180-(180-2t))^\\circ = (2t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $XY=YB$, we have $\\angle XBY = \\angle BXY = (2t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle XYB$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle XYB = (180-4t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AYX$, $\\angle XYB$, and $\\angle BYC$ add to form a straight angle, so their sum is $180^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle BYC = (180-t-(180-4t))^\\circ = (3t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $YB=BC$, we have $\\angle YCB = \\angle BYC = (3t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle YBC$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle YBC = (180-6t)^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, $\\angle ABC = \\angle XBY + \\angle YBC = (2t)^\\circ + (180-6t)^\\circ = (180-4t)^\\circ$. We know this is equal to $120^\\circ$, so we solve the equation $$180-4t = 120$$ to obtain $t=\\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measure of each exterior angle of a regular polygon is $30$ degrees. What is the sum of the measures of the interior angles, in degrees?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Taking one exterior angle per vertex, the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$. If each exterior angle is $30^\\circ$, then the polygon has $\\frac{360}{30}=12$ sides. The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$, so for a polygon with 12 sides, the sum of the interior angles is $180(12-2)=\\boxed{1800}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB=AC$ and $D$ is a point on $\\overline{AC}$ so that $\\overline{BD}$ bisects angle $ABC$. If $BD=BC$, what is the measure, in degrees, of angle $A$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $AB=AC$, triangle $ABC$ must be an isosceles triangle and the measures of $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle ACB$ must be equal. Continuing, since $\\overline{BD}$ bisects angle $ABC$, we have that the measures of $\\angle ABD$ and $\\angle BDC$ are equal. Finally, since $BD=BC$, triangle $BDC$ must also be an isosceles triangle so the measures of $\\angle BDC = \\angle BCD$. Now if we consider triangle $BDC$, we know that angles $BDC$ and $BCD$ have equal angle measures and angle $DBC$ has an angle measure that is half that of the other two. Since these three angle measures must add up to $180^\\circ$, we have that $\\angle DBC$ has measure $36^\\circ$ and angles $BDC$ and $BCD$ have measures $72 ^\\circ$.\n\nNow, since $\\angle ABC \\cong \\angle ACB$ and $\\angle ACB$ has measure $72^\\circ$, we know that $\\angle A$ must have an angle measure of $180-72-72=\\boxed{36}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles, obtuse triangle has one angle with a degree measure that is 50$\\%$ larger than the measure of a right angle. What is the measure, in degrees, of one of the two smallest angles in the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n An angle with measure $50\\%$ larger than the measure of a right angle has measure $\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot 90^{\\circ}=135^{\\circ}$.\n\nThus the other two angles have a combined measure of $45^{\\circ}$. Each one has a measure of\n\n$$\\frac{45^{\\circ}}{2}=\\boxed{22.5^{\\circ}}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, the angle bisectors are $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$, which intersect at the incenter $I$.  If $\\angle ACB = 38^\\circ$, then find the measure of $\\angle AIE$, in degrees.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $AD$ is an angle bisector, $\\angle BAI = \\angle BAC/2$.  Since $BE$ is an angle bisector, $\\angle ABI = \\angle ABC/2$.  As an angle that is external to triangle $ABI$, $\\angle AIE = \\angle BAI + \\angle ABI = \\angle BAC/2 + \\angle ABC/2$.\n\n[asy]\nimport geometry;\n\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, I;\n\nA = (2,12);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (14,0);\nI = incenter(A,B,C);\nD = extension(A,I,B,C);\nE = extension(B,I,C,A);\nF = extension(C,I,A,B);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"$I$\", I, NNE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle ACB = 38^\\circ$, \\[\\angle AIE = \\frac{\\angle BAC + \\angle ABC}{2} = \\frac{180^\\circ - \\angle ACB}{2} = \\frac{180^\\circ - 38^\\circ}{2} = \\boxed{71^\\circ}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular polygon has exterior angles each measuring 15 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The measure of each exterior angle in a regular $n$-gon is $360/n$ degrees.  Setting this expression equal to 15, we find $n=\\boxed{24}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If all angles are measured in degrees, the ratio of three times the measure of $\\angle A$ to four times the measure of the complement of $\\angle A$ to half the measure of the supplement of $\\angle A$ is $3:14:4$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of the complement of $\\angle A$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
