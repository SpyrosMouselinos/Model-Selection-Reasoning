    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone having a diameter of 10cm and a height of 6cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The radius of the base of the cone is $10/2 = 5$, so the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{50 \\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a given sphere is $36\\pi$ cubic inches. How many square inches are in its surface area? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Here, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=36\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\\pi(3^2)=\\boxed{36\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cones with radius 12 cm and height 12 cm are enclosed within a cylinder. The base of each cone is a base of the cylinder, and the height of the cylinder is 24 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cylinder not occupied by the cones? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylinder has volume $\\pi (12)^2 (24)$ cubic cm.  Each cone has volume $(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12)$ cubic cm.  Hence the volume of the space in the cylinder not occupied by the cones is  \\begin{align*}\n\\pi (12)^2 (24) - (2)(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12) &= 12^3\\pi(2-2/3)\\\\\n&=12^3\\pi(4/3)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{2304\\pi} \\text{ cubic cm}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The surface area of a particular sphere is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a cylinder is $54\\pi$ $\\text{cm}^3$. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone with the same radius and height as the cylinder? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$. [asy]\nimport solids; currentprojection=orthographic(0,100,25); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nrevolution cyl = cylinder((5,0,0),1,5,Z);\nrevolution cone = cone((0,0,0),1,5,Z);\ndraw(cyl,backpen=dashed);\ndraw(cone,backpen=dashed);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $(1/3)\\pi r^2 h$; a cylinder with the same radius and height has volume $\\pi r^2 h$.  Thus we see the volume of the corresponding cone has 1/3 the volume of the cylinder, which is $(1/3)(54\\pi = \\boxed{18\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The slant height of a cone is 13 cm, and the height from the vertex to the center of the base is 12 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cone? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We create a right triangle with the slant height as the hypotenuse, the height from the vertex to the center of the base as one of the legs, and a radius as the other leg.  By Pythagorean theorem, the radius measures $\\sqrt{13^2-12^2}=5$ cm.  It follows that the volume of the cone is $(1/3)\\pi(5^2)(12)=\\boxed{100\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone has a volume of $12\\pi$ cubic centimeters. The height of the cone is 4 cm. How many centimeters is the circumference of the base of the cone, in terms of $\\pi$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. We're given that the volume is $12\\pi$ and the height is $4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 = 12\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$. Therefore, the circumference of the base is $2\\pi r = \\boxed{6\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The areas of three of the faces of a right, rectangular prism are $24 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2$, $32 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2$, and $48 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2$. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the three dimensions of the prism (length, width, and height, although not necessarily in that order) be $x,y,z$ such that $xy = 24$, $xz = 32$, and $yz = 48$.  Then the volume of the prism is $xyz$.  Multiplying our three equations together and taking the square root of both sides, we find that $xyz = \\sqrt{24\\cdot 32\\cdot 48} = \\boxed{192}$ cubic centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Increasing the radius of a cylinder by $6$ units increased the volume by $y$ cubic units. Increasing the height of the cylinder by $6$ units also increases the volume by $y$ cubic units. If the original height is $2$, then the original radius is:\n$\\text{(A) } 2 \\qquad \\text{(B) } 4 \\qquad \\text{(C) } 6 \\qquad \\text{(D) } 6\\pi \\qquad \\text{(E) } 8$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that the volume of a cylinder is equal to $\\pi r^2h$, where $r$ and $h$ are the radius and height, respectively. So we know that $2\\pi (r+6)^2-2\\pi r^2=y=\\pi r^2(2+6)-2\\pi r^2$. Expanding and rearranging, we get that $2\\pi (12r+36)=6\\pi r^2$. Divide both sides by $6\\pi$ to get that $4r+12=r^2$, and rearrange to see that $r^2-4r-12=0$. This factors to become $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=6$ or $r=-2$. Obviously, the radius cannot be negative, so our answer is $\\boxed{6}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylinder with a height of 5 inches has a radius of 2 inches. What is the area of the curved surface of the cylinder, in square inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The lateral area of a cylinder is $2\\pi rh$. Since $h = 5$ and $r = 2$, our answer is $2\\pi\\cdot 2\\cdot 5 = \\boxed{20\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lateral surface area of a cylindrical tube with a height of 6 cm is $48\\pi$ square centimeters. In cubic centimeters, what is the tube's volume? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nAnswer:\n",
