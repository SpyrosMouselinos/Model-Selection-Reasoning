    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a cylinder is $54\\pi$ $\\text{cm}^3$. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone with the same radius and height as the cylinder? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$. [asy]\nimport solids; currentprojection=orthographic(0,100,25); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nrevolution cyl = cylinder((5,0,0),1,5,Z);\nrevolution cone = cone((0,0,0),1,5,Z);\ndraw(cyl,backpen=dashed);\ndraw(cone,backpen=dashed);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $(1/3)\\pi r^2 h$; a cylinder with the same radius and height has volume $\\pi r^2 h$.  Thus we see the volume of the corresponding cone has 1/3 the volume of the cylinder, which is $(1/3)(54\\pi = \\boxed{18\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cones with radius 12 cm and height 12 cm are enclosed within a cylinder. The base of each cone is a base of the cylinder, and the height of the cylinder is 24 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cylinder not occupied by the cones? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylinder has volume $\\pi (12)^2 (24)$ cubic cm.  Each cone has volume $(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12)$ cubic cm.  Hence the volume of the space in the cylinder not occupied by the cones is  \\begin{align*}\n\\pi (12)^2 (24) - (2)(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12) &= 12^3\\pi(2-2/3)\\\\\n&=12^3\\pi(4/3)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{2304\\pi} \\text{ cubic cm}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The slant height of a cone is 13 cm, and the height from the vertex to the center of the base is 12 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cone? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We create a right triangle with the slant height as the hypotenuse, the height from the vertex to the center of the base as one of the legs, and a radius as the other leg.  By Pythagorean theorem, the radius measures $\\sqrt{13^2-12^2}=5$ cm.  It follows that the volume of the cone is $(1/3)\\pi(5^2)(12)=\\boxed{100\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The truncated right circular cone has a large base radius 8 cm and a small base radius of 4 cm. The height of the truncated cone is 6 cm. How many $\\text{cm}^3$ are in the volume of this solid?  [asy]\n\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\n\ndraw(ellipse((0,0),4,1)); draw(ellipse((0,3),2,1/2));\n\ndraw((-3.97,.1)--(-1.97,3.1)^^(3.97,.1)--(1.97,3.1));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\ndraw(ellipse((0,0),4,1)); draw(ellipse((0,3),2,1/2),gray(.7));\n// draw((-3.97,.1)--(-1.97,3.1)^^(3.97,.1)--(1.97,3.1));\ndraw((-3.97,.1)--(0,6.07)--(3.97,.1));\n\ndraw((4,0)--(0,0)--(0,6.07),linewidth(0.8));\ndraw((2,3)--(0,3),linewidth(0.8));\nlabel(\"4\",(2,3)--(0,3),S);\nlabel(\"8\",(4,0)--(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"6\",(0,0)--(0,3),W);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(0,2)--(0,6.07),W);\n[/asy]\n\nWe \"complete\" the truncated cone by adding a smaller, similar cone atop the cut, forming a large cone.  We don't know the height of the small cone, so call it $x$.  Since the small and large cone are similar, we have $x/4=(x+6)/8$; solving yields $x=6$.  Hence the small cone has radius 4, height 6, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(4^2)(6)=32\\pi$ and the large cone has radius 8, height 12, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(8^2)(12)=256\\pi$.  The frustum's volume is the difference of these two volumes, or $256\\pi-32\\pi=\\boxed{224\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the cylinder. Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nimport solids; size(150); import three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); currentprojection = orthographic(5,0,3);\nrevolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), 1, 3);\nrevolution c2 = cone((0,0,0), 1,1.5);\ndraw(c,black);\ndraw(c2,black);\n\ndraw((1.5,0)--(1.5,2.5),Arrows(TeXHead));\nlabel(\"12\",(1.5,0)--(1.5,2.5),E);\ndraw((-1.5,0)--(-1.5,1.25),Arrows(TeXHead));\nlabel(\"6\",(-1.5,0)--(-1.5,1.25),W);\n\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0),Arrows(TeXHead));\nlabel(\"4\",(0,0)--(1,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is $(1/3) \\pi r^2 h$; the volume of a cylinder with similar dimensions is $\\pi r^2 h$.  The cone has the same radius as the cylinder and half the height, so it has $1/3$ the volume of half the cylinder and thus has $1/2\\cdot 1/3 = 1/6$ the volume of the whole cylinder.  Hence the desired ratio is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone having a diameter of 10cm and a height of 6cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The radius of the base of the cone is $10/2 = 5$, so the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{50 \\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone has a volume of $12\\pi$ cubic centimeters. The height of the cone is 4 cm. How many centimeters is the circumference of the base of the cone, in terms of $\\pi$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. We're given that the volume is $12\\pi$ and the height is $4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 = 12\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$. Therefore, the circumference of the base is $2\\pi r = \\boxed{6\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone is inscribed in a right prism as shown. What is the ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the prism? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$. [asy]\nimport three; import graph3;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nsize(200);\ndraw((0,0,0)--(1,0,0)--(1,1,0)--(0,1,0)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0,1)--(1,0,1)--(1,1,1)--(0,1,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0,0)--(0,0,1)); draw((1,0,0)--(1,0,1)); draw((1,1,0)--(1,1,1)); draw((0,1,0)--(0,1,1));\ndraw(Circle((0.5,0.5,0),0.5),dashed);\ndraw((0.5,0.5,1)--(0.5,0,0),dashed); draw((0.5,0.5,1)--(0.5,1,0),dashed); draw((0.5,0.5,1)--(1,0.5,0),dashed); draw((0.5,0.5,1)--(0,0.5,0),dashed);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the cone is tangent to all sides of the base of the prism, the base of the prism is a square.  Furthermore, if the radius of the base of the cone is $r$, then the side length of the square is $2r$.\n\nLet $h$ be the common height of the cone and the prism.  Then the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h,\\] and the volume of the prism is $(2r)^2 h = 4r^2 h$, so the desired ratio is \\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h}{4r^2 h} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{12}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cone has a volume of $12288\\pi$ cubic inches and the vertex angle of the vertical cross section is 60 degrees. What is the height of the cone? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy]\n\nimport markers;\nsize(150);\nimport geometry;\ndraw(scale(1,.2)*arc((0,0),1,0,180),dashed);\ndraw(scale(1,.2)*arc((0,0),1,180,360));\ndraw((-1,0)--(0,sqrt(3))--(1,0));\n\n//draw(arc(ellipse((2.5,0),1,0.2),0,180),dashed);\ndraw(shift((2.5,0))*scale(1,.2)*arc((0,0),1,0,180),dashed);\ndraw((1.5,0)--(2.5,sqrt(3))--(3.5,0)--cycle);\n\n//line a = line((2.5,sqrt(3)),(1.5,0));\n//line b = line((2.5,sqrt(3)),(3.5,0));\n//markangle(\"$60^{\\circ}$\",radius=15,a,b);\n//markangle(\"$60^{\\circ}$\",radius=15,(1.5,0),(2.5,sqrt(3)),(1.5,0));\nmarkangle(Label(\"$60^{\\circ}$\"),(1.5,0),(2.5,sqrt(3)),(3.5,0),radius=15);\n//markangle(Label(\"$60^{\\circ}$\"),(1.5,0),origin,(0,1),radius=20);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cross section of the cone is an equilateral triangle. The ratio of the base to the height of an equilateral triangle is 1 to $\\sqrt{3}/2$. In terms of the radius, $r$, the base is $2r$ and the height is $2r\\sqrt{3}/2$, or $r\\sqrt{3}$. Since we know the volume of the cone, we can use the volume formula and solve the equation  \\[(1/3) \\times \\pi \\times r^2 \\times r\\sqrt{3} = 12288\\pi\\]  for $r$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $\\pi$ gives  $(1/3)r^3\\sqrt{3} = 12288$. Tripling both sides, we get $r^3\\sqrt{3} = 36,\\!864$. Now, we want $r\\sqrt{3},$ so we multiply both sides by $3$ to get $r^3\\cdot(\\sqrt{3})^3 = (r\\sqrt{3})^3 = 36,\\!864 \\cdot 3 = 110,\\!592.$ Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $r\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{48.0}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone is inscribed in a right circular cylinder.
