    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base that measures 10 cm on each side. Its peak is 12 cm above the center of its base. What is the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"12\",(6.5,5),E);\n\ndraw((6.6,15)..(6.7,14.9)..(6.8,14.7)--(6.8,5.3)..(6.9,5.2)..(7,5)..(6.9,4.8)..(6.8,4.7)--(6.8,1.8)..(6.7,1.6)..(6.6,1.5),linewidth(.7));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To start, we can draw in a line from where the altitude meets the base to one of the bottom corners as shown:\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,1.5)--(10,0),linewidth(.7));\n[/asy]\n\nThe length of this segment will be half the length of the diagonal of the base.  The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A prism has 15 edges. How many faces does the prism have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If a prism has 2 bases and $L$ lateral faces, then each base is an $L$-gon, so the two bases collectively have $2L$ edges.  Also, there are $L$ edges connecting corresponding vertices of the two bases, for a total of $3L$ edges.  Solving $3L=15$, we find that the prism has 5 lateral faces and hence $5+2=\\boxed{7}$ faces in total.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid is formed on a $6\\times 8$ rectangular base. The four edges joining the apex to the corners of the rectangular base each have length $13$. What is the volume of the pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know the rectangular base of the pyramid has area $48$. To find the volume, we must also determine the height.\n\nLet the rectangular base be $ABCD$. Let the apex of the pyramid be $X$, and let $O$ be the foot of the perpendicular drawn from $X$ to face $ABCD$: [asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport three;\ntriple A = (-3,-4,0);\ntriple B = (-3,4,0);\ntriple C = (3,4,0);\ntriple D = (3,-4,0);\ntriple O = (0,0,0);\ntriple X = (0,0,12);\ndraw(B--C--D--A--B--X--D);\ndraw(X--C); draw(A--X--O--D,dashed);\ndot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(O); dot(X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,W);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,ESE);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,N);\ndraw(O+(X-O)/19.2--O+(X-O)/19.2+(D-O)/8--O+(D-O)/8);\n[/asy] Then by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\begin{align*}\n13^2 &= OX^2+OA^2 = OX^2+OB^2 \\\\\n&= OX^2+OC^2 = OX^2+OD^2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $OA=OB=OC=OD$, so $O$ must be the center of the rectangle (where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet). This is also the point where the diagonals of $ABCD$ bisect each other. Each diagonal of $ABCD$ has length $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$, so we have $OA=OB=OC=OD=5$.\n\nThus $OX=\\sqrt{13^2-OD^2} = \\sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$, and so the height of the pyramid is $12$. The volume is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac 13\\cdot (\\text{area of base})\\cdot (\\text{height}) &= \\frac 13\\cdot 48\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= 16\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{192}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n One of the five faces of the triangular prism shown here will be used as the base of a new pyramid. The numbers of exterior faces, vertices and edges of the resulting shape (the fusion of the prism and pyramid) are added. What is the maximum value of this sum?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(9,12)--(25,0)--cycle);\ndraw((9,12)--(12,14)--(28,2)--(25,0));\ndraw((12,14)--(3,2)--(0,0),dashed);\ndraw((3,2)--(28,2),dashed);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The original prism has 5 faces, 9 edges, and 6 vertices.  If the new pyramid is added to a triangular face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 3 new faces.  If instead the new pyramid is added to a quadrilateral face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 4 new edges, and 4 new faces.  So, we maximize the sum by adding a pyramid to a quadrilateral face.  This gives us a solid with $5-1+4 = 8$ faces, $9+4=13$ edges, and $6 + 1 = 7$ vertices.  The sum of these is $\\boxed{28}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the sum of the number of faces, edges and vertices of a triangular prism?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(10,0)--(5,8.7)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(20,20),dashed);\ndraw((10,0)--(30,20));\ndraw((5,8.7)--(25,28.7));\ndraw((25,28.7)--(30,20)--(20,20)--cycle,dashed);\ndraw((25,28.7)--(30,20));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Faces: There are $3$ on the sides, a top face, and a bottom face, so $5$.\n\nEdges: There are $3$ on the top, $3$ on the bottom, and $3$ connecting them, for $9$.\n\nVertices: There are $3$ on the top and $3$ on the bottom, for $6$.\n\nSo $5+9+6=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $ABCD$, a rectangle with $AB = 12$ and $BC = 16$, is the base of pyramid $P$, which has a height of $24$. A plane parallel to $ABCD$ is passed through $P$, dividing $P$ into a frustum $F$ and a smaller pyramid $P'$. Let $X$ denote the center of the circumsphere of $F$, and let $T$ denote the apex of $P$. If the volume of $P$ is eight times that of $P'$, then the value of $XT$ can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute the value of $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n As we are dealing with volumes, the ratio of the volume of $P'$ to $P$ is the cube of the ratio of the height of $P'$ to $P$.\nThus, the height of $P$ is $\\sqrt [3]{8} = 2$ times the height of $P'$, and thus the height of each is $12$.\nThus, the top of the frustum is a rectangle $A'B'C'D'$ with $A'B' = 6$ and $B'C' = 8$.\nNow, consider the plane that contains diagonal $AC$ as well as the altitude of $P$. Taking the cross section of the frustum along this plane gives the trapezoid $ACC'A'$, inscribed in an equatorial circular section of the sphere. It suffices to consider this circle.\nFirst, we want the length of $AC$. This is given by the Pythagorean Theorem over triangle $ABC$ to be $20$. Thus, $A'C' = 10$. Since the height of this trapezoid is $12$, and $AC$ extends a distance of $5$ on either direction of $A'C'$, we can use a 5-12-13 triangle to determine that $AA' = CC' = 13$.\nNow, we wish to find a point equidistant from $A$, $A'$, and $C$. By symmetry, this point, namely $X$, must lie on the perpendicular bisector of $AC$. Let $X$ be $h$ units from $A'C'$ in $ACC'A'$. By the Pythagorean Theorem twice,\\begin{align*} 5^2 + h^2 & = r^2 \\\\ 10^2 + (12 - h)^2 & = r^2 \\end{align*}Subtracting gives $75 + 144 - 24h = 0 \\Longrightarrow h = \\frac {73}{8}$. Thus $XT = h + 12 = \\frac {169}{8}$ and $m + n = \\boxed{177}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many non-congruent triangles with only integer side lengths have a perimeter of 15 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In a triangle, the lengths of any two sides must add up to a value larger than the third length's side.  This is known as the Triangle Inequality.  Keeping this in mind, we list out cases based on the length of the shortest side.\n\nCase 1:  shortest side has length $1$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $7$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{1,7,7\\}$.\n\nCase 2:  shortest side has length $2$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $6$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{2,6,7\\}$.\n\nCase 3:  shortest side has length $3$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $6$ and $6$ or $5$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{3,6,6\\}$ and $\\{3,5,7\\}$.\n\nCase 4:  shortest side has length $4$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $5$ and $6$ or $4$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{4,5,6\\}$ and $\\{4,4,7\\}$.\n\nCase 5:  shortest side has length $5$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $5$ and $5$.  This leads to the set $\\{5,5,5\\}$.\n\nHence there are $\\boxed{7}$ sets of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of $15$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the total area, in square units, of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid that has base edges measuring 6 units and lateral edges measuring 5 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The triangular faces are isosceles triangles.  We drop an altitude from the apex to the base, and, since the triangle is isosceles, it will also be a median.  So it forms a right triangle with hypotenuse $5$ and one leg $3$, and thus the other leg, the altitude, is $4$.  The area of the triangle is then $\\frac{4(6)}{2}=12$.  Since there are $4$ triangular faces, the total area is $4(12)=\\boxed{48}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has eight vertices (corners) and twelve edges. A segment, such as $x$, which joins two vertices not joined by an edge is called a diagonal. Segment $y$ is also a diagonal. How many diagonals does a cube have? [asy]\n/* AMC8 1998 #17 Problem */\npair A=(0,48), B=(0,0), C=(48,0), D=(48,48);\npair E=(24,72), F=(24,24), G=(72,24), H=(72,72);\npen d = linetype(\"8 8\");\n\ndraw(A--D--C--B--cycle);\ndraw(D--H--G--C);\ndraw(A--E--H);\n\ndraw(B--F--E);\ndraw(F--G);\ndraw(H--A--G, d);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (40, 61), N);\nlabel(\"$y$\", (40, 35), N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are two diagonals, such as $x$, in each of the six faces for a total of twelve face diagonals. There are also four space diagonals, such as $y$, which are within the cube. This makes a total of $\\boxed{16}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Consider the paper triangle whose vertices are $(0,0), (34,0),$ and $(16,24).$ The vertices of its midpoint triangle are the midpoints of its sides. A triangular pyramid is formed by folding the triangle along the sides of its midpoint triangle. What is the volume of this pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]defaultpen(fontsize(9)+linewidth(0.63)); pair A=(0,0), B=(16,24), C=(34,0), P=(8,12), Q=(25,12), R=(17,0); draw(A--B--C--A);draw(P--Q--R--P); draw(A--foot(A,B,C));draw(B--foot(B,A,C));draw(C--foot(C,A,B)); label(\"\\(A\\)\",A,SW);label(\"\\(B\\)\",B,NW);label(\"\\(C\\)\",C,SE); label(\"\\(D\\)\",foot(A,B,C),NE);label(\"\\(E\\)\",foot(B,A,C),SW);label(\"\\(F\\)\",foot(C,A,B),NW);label(\"\\(P\\)\",P,NW);label(\"\\(Q\\)\",Q,NE);label(\"\\(R\\)\",R,SE);[/asy][asy]import three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.6)); currentprojection=orthographic(1/2,-1,1/2); triple A=(0,0,0), B=(16,24,0), C=(34,0,0), P=(8,12,0), Q=(25,12,0), R=(17,0,0), S=(16,12,12); draw(A--B--C--A); draw(P--Q--R--P); draw(S--P..S--Q..S--R); draw(S--(16,12,0)); [/asy]\nAs shown in the image above, let $D$, $E$, and $F$ be the midpoints of $\\overline{BC}$, $\\overline{CA}$, and $\\overline{AB}$, respectively. Suppose $P$ is the apex of the tetrahedron, and let $O$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to $\\triangle ABC$. The crux of this problem is the following lemma.\nLemma: The point $O$ is the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nProof. Observe that\\[OF^2 - OE^2 = PF^2 - PE^2 = AF^2 - AE^2;\\]the first equality follows by the Pythagorean Theorem, while the second follows from $AF = FP$ and $AE = EP$. Thus, by the Perpendicularity Lemma, $AO$ is perpendicular to $FE$ and hence $BC$. Analogously, $O$ lies on the $B$-altitude and $C$-altitude of $\\triangle ABC$, and so $O$ is, indeed, the orthocenter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nTo find the coordinates of $O$, we need to find the intersection point of altitudes $BE$ and $AD$. The equation of $BE$ is simply $x=16$. $AD$ is perpendicular to line $BC$, so the slope of $AD$ is equal to the negative reciprocal of the slope of $BC$. $BC$ has slope $\\frac{24-0}{16-34}=-\\frac{4}{3}$, therefore $y=\\frac{3}{4} x$. These two lines intersect at $(16,12)$, so that's the base of the height of the tetrahedron.\nLet $S$ be the foot of altitude $BS$ in $\\triangle BPQ$. From the Pythagorean Theorem, $h=\\sqrt{BS^2-SO^2}$. However, since $S$ and $O$ are, by coincidence, the same point, $SO=0$ and $h=12$.\nThe area of the base is $102$, so the volume is $\\frac{102*12}{3}=\\boxed{408}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If a pyramid has $14$ edges, how many vertices does it have?\n\nAnswer:\n",
