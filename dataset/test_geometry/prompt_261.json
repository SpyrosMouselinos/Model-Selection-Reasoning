    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 22, AC=12,$ and $BC=14$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=24$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24\\cdot 2\\cdot 12\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 24\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$24\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 24,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle ABC$ be a right triangle such that $B$ is a right angle. A circle with diameter of $BC$ meets side $AC$ at $D.$ If the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $150$ and $AC = 25,$ then what is $BD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We might try sketching a diagram: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO, pD;\npA = (-15, 0);\npB = (0, 0);\npC = (0, 20);\npO = (0, 10);\npD = (-9.6, 7.2);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pD--pB);\ndraw(circle(pO, 10));\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, S);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", pD, W);\n[/asy] Since $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, that makes $\\angle BDC$ a right angle. That means that $BD$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC.$ Then, we use the area formula to find $150 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC \\cdot BD,$ where $AC = 25.$ Solving, we have $BD = \\boxed{12}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 7$, $AC = 15$, and the length of median $AM$ is 10.  Find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Extend $AM$ to $D$ so that $MD = MA$.  Then triangles $AMB$ and $DMC$ are congruent, so triangles $ABC$ and $ACD$ have equal area.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, M;\n\nA = (-7/sqrt(37),42/sqrt(37));\nB = (0,0);\nC = (2*sqrt(37),0);\nM = (B + C)/2;\nD = 2*M - A;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D--C);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$7$\", (A + B)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$15$\", (A + C)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (A + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (D + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$7$\", (C + D)/2, E);\n[/asy]\n\nThe semi-perimeter of triangle $ACD$ is $(7 + 15 + 20)/2 = 21$, so by Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ACD$ is $$\\sqrt{21 (21 - 7)(21 - 15)(21 - 20)} = \\boxed{42}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 5, AC=6, BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=9$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{9\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{3^3\\cdot 2^3} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{6}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{6} = r\\cdot 9,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the diameter of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 11,$ $AC=6,$ and $BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $d$ be the diameter of the inscribed circle, and let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=12$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{12\\cdot 1\\cdot 6\\cdot 5} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{6^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 12,$$which yields the radius $r=\\frac {\\sqrt{10}}{2}$. This yields the diameter $d = \\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 9$, $BC = 12$, $AC = 15$, and $CD$ is the angle bisector.  Find the length of $CD$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n $\\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle, since $9^2 + 12^2 = 15^2$. Thus, $\\angle ABC = 90^\\circ$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D;\n\nA = (0,9);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (12,0);\nD = (0,4);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--D);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, W);\n[/asy]\n\nBy the angle bisector theorem, $BD/AD = BC/AC$, so \\[BD = \\frac{BC}{BC + AC} \\cdot AB = \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot 9 = 4.\\] Then by use of the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $BCD$, $CD = \\sqrt{BC^2 + BD^2} = \\sqrt{12^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{160} = \\boxed{4 \\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the area of rhombus $ABCD$ given that the radii of the circles circumscribed around triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$ are $12.5$ and $25$, respectively.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The diagonals of the rhombus perpendicularly bisect each other. Call half of diagonal BD $a$ and half of diagonal AC $b$. The length of the four sides of the rhombus is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.\nThe area of any triangle can be expressed as $\\frac{a\\cdot b\\cdot c}{4R}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides and $R$ is the circumradius. Thus, the area of $\\triangle ABD$ is $ab=2a(a^2+b^2)/(4\\cdot12.5)$. Also, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $ab=2b(a^2+b^2)/(4\\cdot25)$. Setting these two expressions equal to each other and simplifying gives $b=2a$. Substitution yields $a=10$ and $b=20$, so the area of the rhombus is $20\\cdot40/2=\\boxed{400}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right $\\triangle ABC$ with hypotenuse $\\overline{AB}$, $AC = 12$, $BC = 35$, and $\\overline{CD}$ is the altitude to $\\overline{AB}$. Let $\\omega$ be the circle having $\\overline{CD}$ as a diameter. Let $I$ be a point outside $\\triangle ABC$ such that $\\overline{AI}$ and $\\overline{BI}$ are both tangent to circle $\\omega$. The ratio of the perimeter of $\\triangle ABI$ to the length $AB$ can be expressed in the form $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $O$ be center of the circle and $P$,$Q$ be the two points of tangent such that $P$ is on $BI$ and $Q$ is on $AI$. We know that $AD:CD = CD:BD = 12:35$.\nSince the ratios between corresponding lengths of two similar diagrams are equal, we can let $AD = 144, CD = 420$ and $BD = 1225$. Hence $AQ = 144, BP = 1225, AB = 1369$ and the radius $r = OD = 210$.\nSince we have $\\tan OAB = \\frac {35}{24}$ and $\\tan OBA = \\frac{6}{35}$ , we have $\\sin {(OAB + OBA)} = \\frac {1369}{\\sqrt {(1801*1261)}},$$\\cos {(OAB + OBA)} = \\frac {630}{\\sqrt {(1801*1261)}}$.\nHence $\\sin I = \\sin {(2OAB + 2OBA)} = \\frac {2*1369*630}{1801*1261}$. let $IP = IQ = x$ , then we have Area$(IBC)$ = $(2x + 1225*2 + 144*2)*\\frac {210}{2}$ = $(x + 144)(x + 1225)* \\sin {\\frac {I}{2}}$. Then we get $x + 1369 = \\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261}$.\nNow the equation looks very complex but we can take a guess here. Assume that $x$ is a rational number (If it's not then the answer to the problem would be irrational which can't be in the form of $\\frac {m}{n}$) that can be expressed as $\\frac {a}{b}$ such that $(a,b) = 1$. Look at both sides; we can know that $a$ has to be a multiple of $1369$ and not of $3$ and it's reasonable to think that $b$ is divisible by $3$ so that we can cancel out the $3$ on the right side of the equation.\nLet's see if $x = \\frac {1369}{3}$ fits. Since $\\frac {1369}{3} + 1369 = \\frac {4*1369}{3}$, and $\\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261} = \\frac {3*1369* \\frac {1801}{3} * \\frac {1261*4}{3}} {1801*1261} = \\frac {4*1369}{3}$. Amazingly it fits!\nSince we know that $3*1369*144*1225 - 1369*1801*1261 < 0$, the other solution of this equation is negative which can be ignored. Hence $x = 1369/3$.\nHence the perimeter is $1225*2 + 144*2 + \\frac {1369}{3} *2 = 1369* \\frac {8}{3}$, and $BC$ is $1369$. Hence $\\frac {m}{n} = \\frac {8}{3}$, $m + n = \\boxed{11}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $\\triangle ABC$ has a right angle at $C$, $\\angle A = 60^\\circ$, and $AC=10$.  Find the radius of the incircle of $\\triangle ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We begin by drawing a diagram:\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\npair A,B,C;\nreal x = sqrt(3);\nC=(0,0); A=(10,0); B=(0,10*x);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(rightanglemark(B,C,A,30));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SE); label(\"$C$\",C,SW); label(\"$B$\",B,NW); label(\"10\",(A+C)/2,S);\n\nreal r = 5*sqrt(3) - 5;\ndraw(Circle((r,r),r));\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle A = 60^\\circ$, we have $\\angle B = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 30^\\circ$.  Then $\\triangle ABC$ is a $30 - 60 - 90$ triangle, so $BC=AC\\sqrt{3}=10\\sqrt{3}$ and $AB=2AC=20$.  We can compute the area of $\\triangle ABC$ as \\[ [\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{1}{2}(AC)(BC)=\\frac{1}{2}(10)(10\\sqrt{3}) = 50\\sqrt{3}.\\]Let the incircle of $\\triangle ABC$ have radius $r$.  A triangle with inradius $r$ and semiperimeter $s$ has \\[\\text{area} = rs,\\]so we have  \\[ [\\triangle ABC] = r \\left( \\frac{10+10\\sqrt{3}+20}{2} \\right) = r(15+5\\sqrt{3}).\\]Setting these two area expressions equal gives \\[50\\sqrt{3}=r(15+5\\sqrt{3}).\\]Solving for $r$ gives  \\[r = \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}(3-\\sqrt{3})}{9-3} = \\boxed{5(\\sqrt{3}-1)}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 5$, $BC = 8$, and the length of median $AM$ is 4.  Find $AC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $BC = 8$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $BM = CM = 4$.  But $AM = 4$, so $M$ is the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$.  Furthermore, $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, so $\\angle BAC = 90^\\circ$.\n\n[asy]\n\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, M;\n\nA = dir(110);\n\nB = (-1,0);\n\nC = (1,0);\n\nM = (0,0);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\n\ndraw(A--M);\n\ndraw(Circle(M,1));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\n\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\n\ndot(\"$M$\", M, S);\n\n[/asy]\n\nThen by Pythagoras on right triangle $ABC$, $AC = \\sqrt{BC^2 - AB^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 - 5^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 25} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{39}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 15,$ $AC = 41,$ and $BC = 52$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
