    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has side-lengths $AB = 12, BC = 24,$ and $AC = 18.$ The line through the incenter of $\\triangle ABC$ parallel to $\\overline{BC}$ intersects $\\overline{AB}$ at $M$ and $\\overline{AC}$ at $N.$ What is the perimeter of $\\triangle AMN?$\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 27 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 30 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\  33 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 36 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 42$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $O$ be the incenter of $\\triangle{ABC}$. Because $\\overline{MO} \\parallel \\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{BO}$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle{ABC}$, we have\n\\[\\angle{MBO} = \\angle{CBO} = \\angle{MOB} = \\frac{1}{2}\\angle{MBC}\\]\nIt then follows due to alternate interior angles and base angles of isosceles triangles that $MO = MB$. Similarly, $NO = NC$. The perimeter of $\\triangle{AMN}$ then becomes\\begin{align*} AM + MN + NA &= AM + MO + NO + NA \\\\ &= AM + MB + NC + NA \\\\ &= AB + AC \\\\ &= \\boxed{30} \\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and a point $K$ on $BC$ such that $AK$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$. If $AC = 10,$ $BK = 7$, and $BC = 13,$ then what is the area of $\\triangle ABC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we sketch! [asy]\npair A, B, C, K;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-7, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nK = (0, 0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--K);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$K$\", K, NE);\nlabel(\"10\", C--A, NE);\nlabel(\"7\", B--K, N);\nlabel(\"13\", B--C, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,K,B,10));\n[/asy] We now see that $CK = BC - BK = 6.$ That means $\\triangle AKC$ is a $3:4:5$ right triangle, so $AK = 8.$ At this point, we can see that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AK \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{52}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has positive integer side lengths with $AB=AC$. Let $I$ be the intersection of the bisectors of $\\angle B$ and $\\angle C$. Suppose $BI=8$. Find the smallest possible perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $D$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$. Then by SAS Congruence, $\\triangle ABD \\cong \\triangle ACD$, so $\\angle ADB = \\angle ADC = 90^o$.\nNow let $BD=y$, $AB=x$, and $\\angle IBD = \\dfrac{\\angle ABD}{2} = \\theta$.\nThen $\\mathrm{cos}{(\\theta)} = \\dfrac{y}{8}$\nand $\\mathrm{cos}{(2\\theta)} = \\dfrac{y}{x} = 2\\mathrm{cos^2}{(\\theta)} - 1 = \\dfrac{y^2-32}{32}$.\nCross-multiplying yields $32y = x(y^2-32)$.\nSince $x,y>0$, $y^2-32$ must be positive, so $y > 5.5$.\nAdditionally, since $\\triangle IBD$ has hypotenuse $\\overline{IB}$ of length $8$, $BD=y < 8$.\nTherefore, given that $BC=2y$ is an integer, the only possible values for $y$ are $6$, $6.5$, $7$, and $7.5$.\nHowever, only one of these values, $y=6$, yields an integral value for $AB=x$, so we conclude that $y=6$ and $x=\\dfrac{32(6)}{(6)^2-32}=48$.\nThus the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ must be $2(x+y) = \\boxed{108}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $B$ is on $\\overline{AC}$ with $AB = 9$ and $BC = 21.$ Point $D$ is not on $\\overline{AC}$ so that $AD = CD,$ and $AD$ and $BD$ are integers. Let $s$ be the sum of all possible perimeters of $\\triangle ACD$. Find $s.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] size(220); pointpen = black; pathpen = black + linewidth(0.7); pair O=(0,0),A=(-15,0),B=(-6,0),C=(15,0),D=(0,8); D(D(MP(\"A\",A))--D(MP(\"C\",C))--D(MP(\"D\",D,NE))--cycle); D(D(MP(\"B\",B))--D); D((0,-4)--(0,12),linetype(\"4 4\")+linewidth(0.7)); MP(\"6\",B/2); MP(\"15\",C/2); MP(\"9\",(A+B)/2); [/asy]\nDenote the height of $\\triangle ACD$ as $h$, $x = AD = CD$, and $y = BD$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find that $h^2 = y^2 - 6^2$ and $h^2 = x^2 - 15^2$. Thus, $y^2 - 36 = x^2 - 225 \\Longrightarrow x^2 - y^2 = 189$. The LHS is difference of squares, so $(x + y)(x - y) = 189$. As both $x,\\ y$ are integers, $x+y,\\ x-y$ must be integral divisors of $189$.\nThe pairs of divisors of $189$ are $(1,189)\\ (3,63)\\ (7,27)\\ (9,21)$. This yields the four potential sets for $(x,y)$ as $(95,94)\\ (33,30)\\ (17,10)\\ (15,6)$. The last is not a possibility since it simply degenerates into a line. The sum of the three possible perimeters of $\\triangle ACD$ is equal to $3(AC) + 2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) = 90 + 2(95 + 33 + 17) = \\boxed{380}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $ABC$, $AB=10$, $AC=6$ and $BC=8$ units.  What is the distance from $C$ to the midpoint of segment $AB$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse.  Therefore, the desired distance is $10/2 = \\boxed{5}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In $\\triangle ABC$, we have $AC=BC=7$  and $AB=2$. Suppose that  $D$ is a point on line $AB$ such that $B$ lies between $A$ and $D$ and $CD=8$. What is  $BD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $\\overline{CH}$  be an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\\triangle CHB$ and to $\\triangle CHD$ produces \\[\n8^2 - (BD +1)^2 = CH^2 = 7^2 - 1^2 = 48, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad (BD+1)^2 = 16.\n\\] Thus $BD = \\boxed{3}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5cm);\npair A,B,C,D,H;\nA=(0,0);\nH=(1,0);\nB=(2,0);\nD=(5,0);\nC=(1,6);\ndraw(A--C--D--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(H--C--B--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"1\",(0.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"1\",(1.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"7\",(0.5,3),NW);\nlabel(\"7\",(1.5,3),NE);\nlabel(\"8\",(3.5,3),NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\nlabel(\"$H$\",H,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of the sides of a triangle are 6 cm, 7 cm and 9 cm.  In a similar triangle whose perimeter is 110 cm, what is the length of the longest side, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the ratio of side lengths between the similar triangle and the given triangle be $x$, so the lengths of the similar triangle are $6x$, $7x$, and $9x$.  We are given that $6x+7x+9x=110$; solving yields $x=\\frac{110}{(6+7+9)} = \\frac{110}{22}=5$.  The length of the longest side is thus $9x = 9 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{45}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right $\\triangle ABC$ with hypotenuse $\\overline{AB}$, $AC = 12$, $BC = 35$, and $\\overline{CD}$ is the altitude to $\\overline{AB}$. Let $\\omega$ be the circle having $\\overline{CD}$ as a diameter. Let $I$ be a point outside $\\triangle ABC$ such that $\\overline{AI}$ and $\\overline{BI}$ are both tangent to circle $\\omega$. The ratio of the perimeter of $\\triangle ABI$ to the length $AB$ can be expressed in the form $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $O$ be center of the circle and $P$,$Q$ be the two points of tangent such that $P$ is on $BI$ and $Q$ is on $AI$. We know that $AD:CD = CD:BD = 12:35$.\nSince the ratios between corresponding lengths of two similar diagrams are equal, we can let $AD = 144, CD = 420$ and $BD = 1225$. Hence $AQ = 144, BP = 1225, AB = 1369$ and the radius $r = OD = 210$.\nSince we have $\\tan OAB = \\frac {35}{24}$ and $\\tan OBA = \\frac{6}{35}$ , we have $\\sin {(OAB + OBA)} = \\frac {1369}{\\sqrt {(1801*1261)}},$$\\cos {(OAB + OBA)} = \\frac {630}{\\sqrt {(1801*1261)}}$.\nHence $\\sin I = \\sin {(2OAB + 2OBA)} = \\frac {2*1369*630}{1801*1261}$. let $IP = IQ = x$ , then we have Area$(IBC)$ = $(2x + 1225*2 + 144*2)*\\frac {210}{2}$ = $(x + 144)(x + 1225)* \\sin {\\frac {I}{2}}$. Then we get $x + 1369 = \\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261}$.\nNow the equation looks very complex but we can take a guess here. Assume that $x$ is a rational number (If it's not then the answer to the problem would be irrational which can't be in the form of $\\frac {m}{n}$) that can be expressed as $\\frac {a}{b}$ such that $(a,b) = 1$. Look at both sides; we can know that $a$ has to be a multiple of $1369$ and not of $3$ and it's reasonable to think that $b$ is divisible by $3$ so that we can cancel out the $3$ on the right side of the equation.\nLet's see if $x = \\frac {1369}{3}$ fits. Since $\\frac {1369}{3} + 1369 = \\frac {4*1369}{3}$, and $\\frac {3*1369*(x + 144)(x + 1225)}{1801*1261} = \\frac {3*1369* \\frac {1801}{3} * \\frac {1261*4}{3}} {1801*1261} = \\frac {4*1369}{3}$. Amazingly it fits!\nSince we know that $3*1369*144*1225 - 1369*1801*1261 < 0$, the other solution of this equation is negative which can be ignored. Hence $x = 1369/3$.\nHence the perimeter is $1225*2 + 144*2 + \\frac {1369}{3} *2 = 1369* \\frac {8}{3}$, and $BC$ is $1369$. Hence $\\frac {m}{n} = \\frac {8}{3}$, $m + n = \\boxed{11}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In quadrilateral $ABCD$, $\\angle B$ is a right angle, diagonal $\\overline{AC}$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{CD}$, $AB=18$, $BC=21$, and $CD=14$. Find the perimeter of $ABCD$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n From the problem statement, we construct the following diagram:\n[asy] pointpen = black; pathpen = black + linewidth(0.65); pair C=(0,0), D=(0,-14),A=(-(961-196)^.5,0),B=IP(circle(C,21),circle(A,18)); D(MP(\"A\",A,W)--MP(\"B\",B,N)--MP(\"C\",C,E)--MP(\"D\",D,E)--A--C); D(rightanglemark(A,C,D,40)); D(rightanglemark(A,B,C,40)); [/asy]\nUsing the Pythagorean Theorem:\n$(AD)^2 = (AC)^2 + (CD)^2$\n$(AC)^2 = (AB)^2 + (BC)^2$\nSubstituting $(AB)^2 + (BC)^2$ for $(AC)^2$:\n$(AD)^2 = (AB)^2 + (BC)^2 + (CD)^2$\nPlugging in the given information:\n$(AD)^2 = (18)^2 + (21)^2 + (14)^2$\n$(AD)^2 = 961$\n$(AD)= 31$\nSo the perimeter is $18+21+14+31=84$, and the answer is $\\boxed{84}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and a point $K$ on segment $\\overline{BC}$ such that $AK$ is an altitude to $\\triangle ABC$. If $AK = 6,$ $BK = 8$, and $CK = 6,$ then what is the perimeter of the triangle?\n\nAnswer:\n",
