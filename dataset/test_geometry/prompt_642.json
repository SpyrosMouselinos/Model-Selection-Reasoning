    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has vertices at $(-3,2),(6,-2),(3,5)$. How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(200);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nreal x = 7;\npair A=(-3,2), B=(6,-2), C=(3,5);\nfill(A--C--(-3,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(B--C--(6,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(A--B--(-3,-2)--cycle,gray(0.6));\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\nxaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\nyaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(-3,2)$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$(6,-2)$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$(3,5)$\",C,N);\ndraw((-3,5)--(6,5)--(6,-2)--(-3,-2)--cycle,dotted);[/asy] We find the area of the given triangle by subtracting the sum of the areas of the three shaded triangles in the figure from the area of the rectangle formed by all four triangles.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $9(7)=63$ square units, and the sum of the areas of the shaded triangles is $$\\frac{1}{2}(6)(3)+\\frac{1}{2}(3)(7)+\\frac{1}{2}(4)(9)=37.5$$ square units.  The area of the fourth triangle is $63-37.5=\\boxed{25.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,5)$, and $(7,12)$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The base of the triangle lies on the $y$-axis, and is 5 units long. The height of the triangle is the horizontal distance from the point $(7,12)$ to the $y$-axis, and is 7 units long. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{5\\cdot7}{2}=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle in a Cartesian coordinate plane has vertices (5, -2), (10, 5) and (5, 5). How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the given points in a coordinate plane, we find that the triangle is a right triangle whose legs have length $5-(-2)=7$ and $10-5=5$ units.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(7)(5)=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(8));\ndotfactor = 4;\ndraw((-1,0)--(10,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,10),Arrows(4));\npair A=(5,-2), B=(10,5), C=(5,5);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(rotate(90)*\"$5-(-2)$\",(0,0.2)+(A+C)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$10-5$\",(B+C)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$(5,-2)$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$(10,5)$\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"$(5,5)$\",C,NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with legs $AB$ and $AC$. Points $X$ and $Y$ lie on legs $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, so that $AX:XB = AY:YC = 1:2$. If $BY = 16$ units, and $CX = 28$ units, what is the length of hypotenuse $BC$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $AB = x$ and $AC = y$. Then we can write two Pythagorean equations from the information given: $(x/3)^2 + y^2 = 28^2$ and $x^2 + (y/3)^2 = 16^2$. These equations become $x^2/9 + y^2 = 784$ and $x^2 + y^2/9 = 256$. Multiplying them both by 9, we get $x^2 + 9y^2= 7056$ and $9x^2 + y^2\n= 2304$. Now we add the two equations to get $10x^2 + 10y^2 = 9360$, which can be reduced to $x^2\n+ y^2 = 936$. We do not need to solve for $x$ and $y$ since 936 is the square of the hypotenuse $BC$. The length is thus $\\sqrt{936} = \\sqrt{(36 \\times 26)} = \\sqrt{36} \\times \\sqrt{26} = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{26}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has sides of length 5, 12 and 13 units, and triangle $DEF$ has sides of length 8, 15 and 17 units. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $DEF$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are both right, since their sides form Pythagorean triples. It follows that the desired ratio is $\\dfrac{(5\\cdot 12)/2}{(8\\cdot 15)/2} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $ABC$, $AB=10$, $AC=6$ and $BC=8$ units.  What is the distance from $C$ to the midpoint of segment $AB$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse.  Therefore, the desired distance is $10/2 = \\boxed{5}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $A(1, 1), B(6, 1), C(3, 7)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that $AB$ has length 5 and is parallel to the $x$-axis. Therefore, the height of the triangle is the difference in the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$, or $7-1 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = \\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the diameter of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 11,$ $AC=6,$ and $BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $d$ be the diameter of the inscribed circle, and let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=12$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{12\\cdot 1\\cdot 6\\cdot 5} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{6^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 12,$$which yields the radius $r=\\frac {\\sqrt{10}}{2}$. This yields the diameter $d = \\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $P$ is inside equilateral $\\triangle ABC$.  Points $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are the feet of the perpendiculars from $P$ to $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CA}$, respectively. Given that $PQ=1$, $PR=2$, and $PS=3$, what is $AB$ in terms of radicals?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the side length of $\\triangle ABC$ be $s$. Then the areas of $\\triangle APB$, $\\triangle BPC$, and $\\triangle CPA$ are, respectively, $s/2$, $s$, and $3s/2$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is the sum of these, which is $3s$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ may also be expressed as $(\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$, so $3s = (\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$. The unique positive solution for $s$ is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 22, AC=12,$ and $BC=14$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=24$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24\\cdot 2\\cdot 12\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 24\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$24\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 24,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle ABC has vertices $A(0, 0)$, $B(0, 3)$ and $C(5, 0)$. A point $P$ inside the triangle is $\\sqrt{10}$ units from point $A$ and $\\sqrt{13}$ units from point $B$. How many units is $P$ from point $C$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\nAnswer:\n",
