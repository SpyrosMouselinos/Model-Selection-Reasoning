    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A jar of peanut butter which is 3 inches in diameter and 4 inches high sells for $\\$$0.60. At the same rate, what would be the price for a jar that is 6 inches in diameter and 6 inches high?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The first jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{3}{2})^24=9\\pi$. The second jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{6}{2})^26=54\\pi$. Note that the volume of the second jar is 6 times greater than that of the first jar. Because peanut butter is sold by volume, the second jar will be six times more expensive than the first jar, for an answer of $\\$0.60\\times6=\\boxed{\\$3.60}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cylindrical glass is half full of lemonade. The ratio of lemon juice to water in the lemonade is 1:11. If the glass is 6 inches tall and has a diameter of 2 inches, what is the volume of lemon juice in the glass? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can begin by calculating the volume of the liquid in the glass.  Since the glass is half full, the portion filled with liquid has height 3 inches.  The volume will be $\\pi r^2 h=\\pi\\cdot 1^2 \\cdot 3 = 3\\pi$.  Now, since the ratio of lemon juice to water is 1:11, the ratio of lemon juice to the liquid will be 1:(1+11) which is 1:12.  So, the volume of lemon juice in the glass is: $$3\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{12}=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\approx .7854$$ So, the answer is $\\boxed{.79}$ to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Either increasing the radius or the height of a cylinder by six inches will result in the same volume. The original height of the cylinder is two inches. What is the original radius in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the original radius be $r$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased radius is $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased height is $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Since we are told these two volumes are the same, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2 = \\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Simplifying, we have $(r+6)^2=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2+12r+36=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2-4r-12=0$. Factoring, we have $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=\\boxed{6}$ (it cannot be negative because it is a physical length).\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cylinders each have radius 8 inches and height 3 inches. The radius of one cylinder and the height of the other are both increased by the same nonzero number of inches. The resulting volumes are equal. How many inches is the increase? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the increase measure $x$ inches.  The cylinder with increased radius now has volume  \\[\\pi (8+x)^2 (3)\\] and the cylinder with increased height now has volume \\[\\pi (8^2) (3+x).\\] Setting these two quantities equal and solving yields  \\[3(64+16x+x^2)=64(3+x) \\Rightarrow 3x^2-16x=x(3x-16)=0\\] so $x=0$ or $x=16/3$.  The latter is the valid solution, so the increase measures $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A $5 \\times 8$ rectangle can be rolled to form two different cylinders with different maximum volumes. What is the ratio of the larger volume to the smaller volume? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Holding the rectangle vertically, we can form a cylinder with height 8 and base circumference of 5.  Let this cylinder have volume $V_A$ and radius $r_A$; we have $2\\pi r_A = 5$ so $r_A = \\frac{5}{2\\pi}$ and $V_A = \\pi r_A ^2 h = \\pi \\left(\\frac{5}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 (8) = \\frac{50}{\\pi}$.\n\nHolding the rectangle horizontally, we can form a cylinder with height 5 and base circumference of 8.  Similarly, let this cylinder have volume $V_B$ and radius $r_B$; we have $2\\pi r_B = 8$ so $r_B = \\frac{4}{\\pi}$ and $V_B = \\pi r_B^2 h = \\pi \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^2 (5) = \\frac{80}{\\pi}$.\n\nHence, the ratio of the larger volume to the smaller volume is $\\frac{80/\\pi}{50/\\pi}=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{5}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When the height of a cylinder is doubled and its radius is increased by $200\\%$, the cylinder's volume is multiplied by a factor of $X$. What is the value of $X$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylinder's original volume is $\\pi r^2h$. The new height is $2h$ and the new radius is $r+\\frac{200}{100}r=3r$. That means the new volume is $\\pi (3r)^2(2h)=\\pi r^2h(9)(2)$. The new volume is the original volume multiplied by a factor of $\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two cylindrical cans have the same volume. The height of one can is triple the height of the other. If the radius of the narrower can is 12 units, how many units are in the length of the radius of the wider can? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the wide can be $h$ and the height of the narrow can be $3h$.  Let the wide can have radius $x$ units.  Since the two volumes are equal, we have \\[\\pi (12^2) (3h) = \\pi (x^2) (h).\\] Solving yields $x = 12\\sqrt{3}$ so the wide can has radius $\\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cone has a base with a circumference of $16\\pi$ inches and a height of 30 inches. The height of this cone is reduced while the circumference stays the same. The volume of the shorter cone is $192\\pi$ cubic inches. What is the ratio of the shorter height to the original height? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cone have radius $r$ inches; we have $2\\pi r = 16\\pi$, so $r = 8$.  Let the new height of the cone be $h$ inches.  We have $192\\pi = (1/3)\\pi(8^2)(h)$; solving yields $h = 9$.  Thus the ratio of the new height to the original height is $9/30 = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid with volume 40 cubic inches has a rectangular base. If the length of the base is doubled, the width tripled and the height increased by $50\\%$, what is the volume of the new pyramid, in cubic inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the volume of a pyramid is linear in each of length, width, and height (in particular, $V = \\frac{1}{3} lwh$), multiplying any of these dimensions by a scalar multiplies the volume by the same scalar.  So the new volume is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 1.50 = 9$ times the old one, or $\\boxed{360}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A company sells peanut butter in cylindrical jars. Marketing research suggests that using wider jars will increase sales. If the diameter of the jars is increased by $25\\%$ without altering the volume, by what percent must the height be decreased?\n\nAnswer:\n",
