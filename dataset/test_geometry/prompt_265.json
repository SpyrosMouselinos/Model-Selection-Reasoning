    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right triangle has a side length of 21 inches and a hypotenuse of 29 inches. A second triangle is similar to the first and has a hypotenuse of 87 inches. What is the length of the shortest side of the second triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we calculate that the other leg of the original right triangle must be $$\\sqrt{29^2 - 21^2} = \\sqrt{841 - 441} = \\sqrt{400} = 20$$ inches. Since 87 is 3 times 29, the length of the shortest side of the second triangle must be $3 \\times 20 = \\boxed{60\\text{ inches}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two similar right triangles have areas of 6 square inches and 150 square inches. The length of the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches. What is the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the smaller triangle has hypotenuse 5, we guess that it is a 3-4-5 triangle.  Sure enough, the area of a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4 is $(3)(4)/2 = 6$, so this works.  The area of the larger triangle is $150/6=25$ times the area of the smaller triangle, so its side lengths are $\\sqrt{25} = 5$ times as long as the side lengths of the smaller triangle.  Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle is $5(3+4) = \\boxed{35}$.\n\nProof that the only possibility for the smaller triangle is that it is a 3-4-5 triangle: Let's call the legs of the smaller triangle $a$ and $b$ (with $b$ being the longer leg) and the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle $c$. Similarly, let's call the corresponding legs of the larger triangle $A$ and $B$ and the hypotenuse of the larger triangle $C$. Since the area of the smaller triangle is 6 square inches, we can say  $$\\frac{1}{2}ab=6.$$ Additionally, we are told that the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches, so $c=5$ and $$a^2+b^2=25.$$ Because $\\frac{1}{2}ab=6$, we get $ab=12$ or $a=\\frac{12}{b}$. We can now write the equation in terms of $b$. We get \\begin{align*}\na^2+b^2&=25\\\\\n\\left(\\frac{12}{b}\\right)^{2}+b^2&=25\\\\\n12^2+b^4&=25b^2\\\\\nb^4-25b^2+144&=0.\n\\end{align*} Solving for $b$, we get  $$b^4-25b^2+144=(b-4)(b+4)(b-3)(b+3)=0.$$ Since we said that $b$ is the longer of the two legs, $b=4$ and $a=3$. Therefore, the triangle must be a 3-4-5 right triangle.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The longer leg of a right triangle is $1$ foot shorter than twice the length of the shorter leg. The area of the triangle is $60$ square feet. What is the length of the hypotenuse, in feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $x$ represents the length of the shorter leg, then the two legs are $x$ and $2x-1$. In a right triangle, the length of one leg is the base and the length of the other leg is the height, so the area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}bh=\\frac{1}{2}x(2x-1)$. We set this equal to 60 and solve for $x$. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}(2x^2-x)&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2x^2-x&=120\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2x^2-x-120&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(2x+15)(x-8)&=0\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ must be positive, we get that $x=8$. The shorter leg is 8 feet long and the longer leg is $2(8)-1=15$ feet long. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse or we recognize that 8 and 15 are part of the Pythagorean triple $8:15:17$. The hypotenuse of the right triangle is $\\boxed{17}$ feet long.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are consecutive whole numbers is 29 units. What is the sum of the lengths of the two legs?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let's call the length of the shorter leg $x$. Then the length of the longer leg is $x + 1$. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we write the equation $x^2 + (x + 1)^2 = 29^2$ and solve for $x$. Expanding $(x + 1)^2$, we get $x\n^2 + x^2 + 2x + 1 = 841$. This can be simplified to $2x^2 + 2x = 840$, or $x^2 + x = 420$. Factoring out $x$ on the left, we can rewrite it as $x(x + 1) = 420$. In other words, the product of these two consecutive numbers is 420, which means they must each be close to the square root of 420. Indeed, $20 \\times 21 = 420$, so the legs must be 20 and 21. Their sum is $20 + 21 = \\boxed{41}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse of an isosceles, right triangle is $10$ units.  What is the length of a leg of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse, so the hypotenuse is $10\\cdot2=20$ units long. Since the right triangle is isosceles, the length of a leg is $20/\\sqrt{2}=\\boxed{10\\sqrt{2}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of the sides of a triangle are 6 cm, 7 cm and 9 cm.  In a similar triangle whose perimeter is 110 cm, what is the length of the longest side, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the ratio of side lengths between the similar triangle and the given triangle be $x$, so the lengths of the similar triangle are $6x$, $7x$, and $9x$.  We are given that $6x+7x+9x=110$; solving yields $x=\\frac{110}{(6+7+9)} = \\frac{110}{22}=5$.  The length of the longest side is thus $9x = 9 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{45}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two sides of an isosceles triangle are 10 inches and 20 inches. If the shortest side of a similar triangle is 50 inches, what is the perimeter of the larger triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First of all, the third side of the smaller triangle cannot be 10 inches because sides of 10, 10 and 20 inches would not form a triangle. The smaller triangle must have sides of 10, 20 and 20 inches. If the shortest side of the similar triangle is 50 inches, then the other two sides are 100 inches and 100 inches. Thus, the perimeter of the larger triangle is $50 + 100 + 100 = \\boxed{250\\text{ inches}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with legs $AB$ and $AC$. Points $X$ and $Y$ lie on legs $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, so that $AX:XB = AY:YC = 1:2$. If $BY = 16$ units, and $CX = 28$ units, what is the length of hypotenuse $BC$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $AB = x$ and $AC = y$. Then we can write two Pythagorean equations from the information given: $(x/3)^2 + y^2 = 28^2$ and $x^2 + (y/3)^2 = 16^2$. These equations become $x^2/9 + y^2 = 784$ and $x^2 + y^2/9 = 256$. Multiplying them both by 9, we get $x^2 + 9y^2= 7056$ and $9x^2 + y^2\n= 2304$. Now we add the two equations to get $10x^2 + 10y^2 = 9360$, which can be reduced to $x^2\n+ y^2 = 936$. We do not need to solve for $x$ and $y$ since 936 is the square of the hypotenuse $BC$. The length is thus $\\sqrt{936} = \\sqrt{(36 \\times 26)} = \\sqrt{36} \\times \\sqrt{26} = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{26}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right triangle with legs $10$ and $8$ is similar to another right triangle with corresponding legs $x$ and $5$, respectively. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By similarity, we know that $\\frac{10}{x} = \\frac{8}{5}$, so therefore $x = \\frac{50}{8} = \\boxed{6.25}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If a triangle has two sides of lengths 5 and 7 units, then how many different integer lengths can the third side be?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $n$ be the length of the third side.  Then by the triangle inequality, \\begin{align*}\nn + 5 &> 7, \\\\\nn + 7 &> 5, \\\\\n5 + 7 &> n,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $n > 2$, $n > -2$, and $n < 12$.  Hence, the possible values of $n$ are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, for a total of $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right triangle has leg lengths of 7 and 24 units. A second triangle is similar to the first triangle and has a hypotenuse of 100 units. What is the length, in units, of the shorter leg of the second triangle?\n\nAnswer:\n",
