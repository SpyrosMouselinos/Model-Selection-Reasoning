    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $\\Delta ABC$ is isosceles with $AC = BC$. If $m\\angle C = 40^{\\circ}$, what is the number of degrees in $m\\angle CBD$? [asy] pair A,B,C,D,E;\nC = dir(65); B = C + dir(-65); D = (1.5,0); E = (2,0);\ndraw(B--C--A--E); dot(D);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S); label(\"$B$\",B,S); label(\"$D$\",D,S); label(\"$C$\",C,N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $x$ be the number of degrees in $\\angle ABC$. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles with $AC=BC$, we have $\\angle BAC=\\angle ABC$.\n\nSo, the three interior angles of $\\triangle ABC$ measure $x^\\circ$, $x^\\circ$, and $40^\\circ$. The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we have $$x+x+40 = 180,$$which we can solve to obtain $x=70$. Finally, $\\angle CBD$ is supplementary to angle $\\angle ABC$, so \\begin{align*}\nm\\angle CBD &= 180^\\circ - m\\angle ABC \\\\\n&= 180^\\circ - 70^\\circ \\\\\n&= \\boxed{110}^\\circ.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ are isosceles with $AB=BC$ and $AD=DC$. Point $D$ is inside $\\triangle ABC$, $\\angle ABC = 40^\\circ$, and $\\angle ADC = 140^\\circ$.  What is the degree measure of $\\angle\nBAD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, \\[\n\\angle BAC=\\frac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\left( 180^{\\circ}-\\angle ABC\\displaystyle\\right)=70^{\\circ}.\n\\] [asy]\npair A,B,C,D;\nA=(-5,0); B=(0,21); C=(5,0); D=(0,6);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw(A--D--C--cycle,linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$140^{\\circ}$\",(0,4),S);\nlabel(\"$40^{\\circ}$\",(0,15),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\n[/asy] Similarly, \\[\n\\angle DAC=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( 180^{\\circ}-\\angle\nADC\\right)=20^{\\circ}.\n\\]  Thus \\[\\angle BAD = \\angle BAC - \\angle DAC\n= \\boxed{50^{\\circ}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In $\\Delta ABC$, $AC = BC$, $m\\angle DCB = 40^{\\circ}$, and $CD \\parallel AB$. What is the number of degrees in $m\\angle ECD$?\n\n[asy] pair A,B,C,D,E; B = dir(-40); A = dir(-140); D = (.5,0); E = .4 * dir(40);\ndraw(C--B--A--E,EndArrow); draw(C--D,EndArrow);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$C$\",C,NW);label(\"$B$\",B,E);label(\"$D$\",D,E);label(\"$E$\",E,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Angles $\\angle DCB$ and $\\angle B$ are alternate interior angles, so they are congruent. Therefore, $m\\angle B=40^\\circ$.\n\nSince $AC=BC$, triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles with equal angles at $A$ and $B$. Therefore, $m\\angle A=40^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, $\\angle A$ and $\\angle ECD$ are corresponding angles, so $m\\angle ECD=m\\angle A = \\boxed{40}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB=AC$ and $D$ is a point on $\\overline{AC}$ so that $\\overline{BD}$ bisects angle $ABC$. If $BD=BC$, what is the measure, in degrees, of angle $A$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $AB=AC$, triangle $ABC$ must be an isosceles triangle and the measures of $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle ACB$ must be equal. Continuing, since $\\overline{BD}$ bisects angle $ABC$, we have that the measures of $\\angle ABD$ and $\\angle BDC$ are equal. Finally, since $BD=BC$, triangle $BDC$ must also be an isosceles triangle so the measures of $\\angle BDC = \\angle BCD$. Now if we consider triangle $BDC$, we know that angles $BDC$ and $BCD$ have equal angle measures and angle $DBC$ has an angle measure that is half that of the other two. Since these three angle measures must add up to $180^\\circ$, we have that $\\angle DBC$ has measure $36^\\circ$ and angles $BDC$ and $BCD$ have measures $72 ^\\circ$.\n\nNow, since $\\angle ABC \\cong \\angle ACB$ and $\\angle ACB$ has measure $72^\\circ$, we know that $\\angle A$ must have an angle measure of $180-72-72=\\boxed{36}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An equilateral triangle shares a common side with a square as shown. What is the number of degrees in $m\\angle CDB$? [asy] pair A,E,C,D,B; D = dir(60); C = dir(0); E = (0,-1); B = C+E; draw(B--D--C--B--E--A--C--D--A); label(\"D\",D,N); label(\"C\",C,dir(0)); label(\"B\",B,dir(0));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the square and the equilateral triangle share a side, all sides of the square are the same length as all sides of the equilateral triangle. Specifically, we have $CD=CB$, and so $\\triangle BCD$ is isosceles with equal angles at $B$ and $D$. Let $x$ denote the number of degrees in the measure of each of these two angles (that is, $x^\\circ=m\\angle CDB=m\\angle CBD$).\n\nAngle $\\angle BCD$ is equal to $90^\\circ+60^\\circ = 150^\\circ$ (since a square and an equilateral triangle have interior angles of $90^\\circ$ and $60^\\circ$, respectively). Since the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we have $$x + x + 150 = 180,$$ giving $x=\\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In an isosceles triangle, one of the angles opposite an equal side is $40^{\\circ}$. How many degrees are in the measure of the triangle's largest angle? [asy] draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(3,2)--(0,0)); label(\"$\\backslash$\",(1.5,1)); label(\"{/}\",(4.5,1));\nlabel(\"$40^{\\circ}$\",(.5,0),dir(45));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two angles opposite the equal sides of an isosceles triangle are congruent, so in this case, both are $40^\\circ$. Since the three angles of a triangle add up to $180^\\circ$, the third angle in this triangle is $(180-40-40)^\\circ = \\boxed{100}^\\circ$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle ABC$ be a right triangle such that $B$ is a right angle. A circle with diameter of $BC$ meets side $AC$ at $D.$ If the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $150$ and $AC = 25,$ then what is $BD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We might try sketching a diagram: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO, pD;\npA = (-15, 0);\npB = (0, 0);\npC = (0, 20);\npO = (0, 10);\npD = (-9.6, 7.2);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pD--pB);\ndraw(circle(pO, 10));\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, S);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", pD, W);\n[/asy] Since $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, that makes $\\angle BDC$ a right angle. That means that $BD$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC.$ Then, we use the area formula to find $150 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC \\cdot BD,$ where $AC = 25.$ Solving, we have $BD = \\boxed{12}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is circumscribed around $ABCD$ as follows: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pD, pO;\npO = (0, 0);\npA = pO + dir(-40);\npB = pO + dir(40);\npC = pO + dir(130);\npD = pO + dir(190);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pA--pD--pC--pA);\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SE);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, NW);\nlabel(\"$D$\", pD, SW);\ndraw(circle(pO, 1));\nlabel(\"$30^\\circ$\", pA + dir(150) * .45);\nlabel(\"$40^\\circ$\", pC + dir(-20) * .35);\n[/asy] How many degrees are in $\\angle CAB + \\angle ACD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can see that $\\angle ACB = 40^\\circ$ must be half of the central angle formed by the arc ${AB},$ or $80^\\circ.$ Likewise, $\\angle CAD = 30^\\circ$ must be half of the central angle formed by the arc ${CD},$ or $60^\\circ.$ Then, we can see that the angles formed by arcs ${BC}$ and ${DA}$ must sum to $360^\\circ - (80^\\circ + 60^\\circ) = 220^\\circ.$ That means the sum $\\angle CAB + \\angle ACD$ must be half of that, or $\\boxed{110^\\circ}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with $AC = BC$ and $\\angle ACB = 106^\\circ.$ Point $M$ is in the interior of the triangle so that $\\angle MAC = 7^\\circ$ and $\\angle MCA = 23^\\circ.$ Find the number of degrees in $\\angle CMB.$\n[asy] pointpen = black; pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); size(220);  /* We will WLOG AB = 2 to draw following */  pair A=(0,0), B=(2,0), C=(1,Tan(37)), M=IP(A--(2Cos(30),2Sin(30)),B--B+(-2,2Tan(23)));  D(MP(\"A\",A)--MP(\"B\",B)--MP(\"C\",C,N)--cycle); D(A--D(MP(\"M\",M))--B); D(C--M); [/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] pointpen = black; pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); size(220);  /* We will WLOG AB = 2 to draw following */  pair A=(0,0), B=(2,0), C=(1,Tan(37)), M=IP(A--(2Cos(30),2Sin(30)),B--B+(-2,2Tan(23))), N=(2-M.x,M.y);  D(MP(\"A\",A)--MP(\"B\",B)--MP(\"C\",C,N)--cycle); D(A--D(MP(\"M\",M))--B); D(C--M); D(C--D(MP(\"N\",N))--B--N--M,linetype(\"6 6\")+linewidth(0.7));  [/asy]\nTake point $N$ inside $\\triangle ABC$ such that $\\angle CBN = 7^\\circ$ and $\\angle BCN = 23^\\circ$.\n$\\angle MCN = 106^\\circ - 2\\cdot 23^\\circ = 60^\\circ$. Also, since $\\triangle AMC$ and $\\triangle BNC$ are congruent (by ASA), $CM = CN$. Hence $\\triangle CMN$ is an equilateral triangle, so $\\angle CNM = 60^\\circ$.\nThen $\\angle MNB = 360^\\circ - \\angle CNM - \\angle CNB = 360^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 150^\\circ = 150^\\circ$. We now see that $\\triangle MNB$ and $\\triangle CNB$ are congruent. Therefore, $CB = MB$, so $\\angle CMB = \\angle MCB = \\boxed{83^\\circ}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AX = XY = YB = BC$ and the measure of angle $ABC$ is 120 degrees. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$?\n\n[asy]\npair A,X,Y,B,C;\nX = A + dir(30); Y = X + dir(0); B = Y + dir(60); C = B + dir(-30);\ndraw(B--Y--X--B--C--A--X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$X$\",X,NW); label(\"$Y$\",Y,S); label(\"$B$\",B,N); label(\"$C$\",C,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $t$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$ (which is what we want to compute).\n\nSince $AX=XY$, we have $\\angle AYX = \\angle YAX = \\angle BAC = t^\\circ$. Then, since the sum of angles in $\\triangle AXY$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle AXY = (180-2t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AXY$ and $\\angle BXY$ add to form a straight angle, so they are supplementary; $\\angle BXY = (180-(180-2t))^\\circ = (2t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $XY=YB$, we have $\\angle XBY = \\angle BXY = (2t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle XYB$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle XYB = (180-4t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AYX$, $\\angle XYB$, and $\\angle BYC$ add to form a straight angle, so their sum is $180^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle BYC = (180-t-(180-4t))^\\circ = (3t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $YB=BC$, we have $\\angle YCB = \\angle BYC = (3t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle YBC$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle YBC = (180-6t)^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, $\\angle ABC = \\angle XBY + \\angle YBC = (2t)^\\circ + (180-6t)^\\circ = (180-4t)^\\circ$. We know this is equal to $120^\\circ$, so we solve the equation $$180-4t = 120$$ to obtain $t=\\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let us have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and a point $D$ on $BC$ such that $BD = DC = DA.$ If $\\angle ABC = 50^\\circ,$ then how many degrees are in $\\angle ACB$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
