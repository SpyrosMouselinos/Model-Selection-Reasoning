Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has sides of length 5, 12 and 13 units, and triangle $DEF$ has sides of length 8, 15 and 17 units. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $DEF$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are both right, since their sides form Pythagorean triples. It follows that the desired ratio is $\\dfrac{(5\\cdot 12)/2}{(8\\cdot 15)/2} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB=13$, $BC=15$ and $CA=17$. Point $D$ is on $\\overline{AB}$, $E$ is on $\\overline{BC}$, and $F$ is on $\\overline{CA}$. Let $AD=p\\cdot AB$, $BE=q\\cdot BC$, and $CF=r\\cdot CA$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are positive and satisfy $p+q+r=2/3$ and $p^2+q^2+r^2=2/5$. The ratio of the area of triangle $DEF$ to the area of triangle $ABC$ can be written in the form $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]  /* -- arbitrary values, I couldn't find nice values for pqr please replace if possible -- */  real p = 0.5, q = 0.1, r = 0.05;   /* -- arbitrary values, I couldn't find nice values for pqr please replace if possible -- */  pointpen = black; pathpen = linewidth(0.7) + black; pair A=(0,0),B=(13,0),C=IP(CR(A,17),CR(B,15)), D=A+p*(B-A), E=B+q*(C-B), F=C+r*(A-C); D(D(MP(\"A\",A))--D(MP(\"B\",B))--D(MP(\"C\",C,N))--cycle); D(D(MP(\"D\",D))--D(MP(\"E\",E,NE))--D(MP(\"F\",F,NW))--cycle); [/asy]\nWe let $[\\ldots]$ denote area; then the desired value is\n$\\frac mn = \\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = \\frac{[ABC] - [ADF] - [BDE] - [CEF]}{[ABC]}$\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle $\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C$, we find that\n$\\frac{[ADF]}{[ABC]} = \\frac{\\frac 12 \\cdot p \\cdot AB \\cdot (1-r) \\cdot AC \\cdot \\sin \\angle CAB}{\\frac 12 \\cdot AB \\cdot AC \\cdot \\sin \\angle CAB} = p(1-r)$\nand similarly that $\\frac{[BDE]}{[ABC]} = q(1-p)$ and $\\frac{[CEF]}{[ABC]} = r(1-q)$. Thus, we wish to find\\begin{align*}\\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} &= 1 - \\frac{[ADF]}{[ABC]} - \\frac{[BDE]}{[ABC]} - \\frac{[CEF]}{[ABC]}  \\\\ &= 1 - p(1-r) - q(1-p) - r(1-q)\\\\ &= (pq + qr + rp) - (p + q + r) + 1 \\end{align*}We know that $p + q + r = \\frac 23$, and also that $(p+q+r)^2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2(pq + qr + rp) \\Longleftrightarrow pq + qr + rp = \\frac{\\left(\\frac 23\\right)^2 - \\frac 25}{2} = \\frac{1}{45}$. Substituting, the answer is $\\frac 1{45} - \\frac 23 + 1 = \\frac{16}{45}$, and $m+n = \\boxed{61}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 16$, $AC = 24$, $BC = 19$, and $AD$ is an angle bisector.  Find the ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$.  (Express your answer as a fraction in lowest terms.)\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$ is $BD/CD$.  By the angle bisector theorem, $BD/CD = AB/AC = 16/24 = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $D$ lies on side $AC$ of equilateral triangle $ABC$ such that the measure of angle $DBC$ is $45$ degrees. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ADB$ to the area of triangle $CDB$? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] size(100); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); pen f = fontsize(10);\npair A=(0,0),B=(0.5,0.5*3^.5),C=(1,0),D=(1/(2+3^.5),0),E=foot(D,B,C);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(B--D--E);\n\ndraw(rightanglemark(D,E,B,2));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S,f); label(\"$B$\",B,N,f); label(\"$C$\",C,S,f); label(\"$D$\",D,S,f); label(\"$E$\",E,NE,f); label(\"$60^{\\circ}$\",C,(-1.8,1),f); label(\"$45^{\\circ}$\",B,(0.8,-6.2),f);\n[/asy] Let $s$ be the length of a side of equilateral triangle $ABC$, and let $E$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ to $\\overline{BC}$. It follows that $\\triangle BDE$ is a $45-45-90$ triangle and $\\triangle CDE$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle. It follows that $BE = DE$ and $CE = DE/\\sqrt{3}$, so $$s = BC = BE + EC = DE + DE/\\sqrt{3} = DE \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right).$$It follows that $DE = \\frac{s}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{s}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{1 + \\sqrt{3}},$ so $CE = DE/\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{s}{1+\\sqrt{3}}$ and $CD = 2CE = \\frac{2s}{1+\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nSince triangles $ADB$ and $CDB$ share the same height, it follows that the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases, namely $AD/CD$. Since $AD = s - CD$, then $$\\frac{AD}{CD}= \\frac{s}{CD} - 1 = \\frac{s}{\\frac{2s}{1+\\sqrt{3}}} - 1 = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}.$$Thus, the ratio of the area of triangle $ADB$ to the area of triangle $CDB$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}- 1}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $ABC$, $AB=9$, $BC=13$, and $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$.  Points $D$ and $E$ are midpoints of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{AC}$ respectively; $\\overline{CD}$ and $\\overline{BE}$ intersect at point $X$.  Compute the ratio of the area of quadrilateral $AEXD$ to the area of triangle $BXC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We begin by drawing a diagram: [asy]\npair A,B,C,D,E,X;\nA=(0,9); B=(0,0); C=(13,0); E=(A+C)/2; D=(A+B)/2; X = intersectionpoint(B--E,D--C); label(\"$X$\",X,N);\nfill(A--E--X--D--cycle,rgb(135,206,250));\n\nfill(B--X--C--cycle,rgb(107,142,35));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--D); draw(B--E);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,15));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW); label(\"$B$\",B,SW); label(\"$C$\",C,SE); label(\"$D$\",D,W); label(\"$E$\",E,NE);\n\nlabel(\"$13$\",(6.5,0),S); label(\"$9$\",(-2,4.5),W);\n\ndraw((-2.7,5.3)--(-2.7,9),EndArrow(TeXHead));draw((-2.7,3.7)--(-2.7,0),EndArrow(TeXHead));\n[/asy]\n\nSince $D$ and $E$ are midpoints, $\\overline{CD}$ and $\\overline{BE}$ are medians.  Let $F$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$; we draw median $\\overline{AF}$.  The medians of a triangle are always concurrent (pass through the same point), so $\\overline{AF}$ passes through $X$ as well.\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,D,E,X,F;\nA=(0,9); B=(0,0); C=(13,0); E=(A+C)/2; D=(A+B)/2; X = intersectionpoint(B--E,D--C); label(\"$X$\",X,N);\n\nF=(B+C)/2; draw(A--F,dashed); label(\"$F$\",F,S);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--D); draw(B--E);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,15));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW); label(\"$B$\",B,SW); label(\"$C$\",C,SE); label(\"$D$\",D,W); label(\"$E$\",E,NE);\n\n[/asy]\n\nThe three medians cut triangle $ABC$ into six smaller triangles.  These six smaller triangles all have the same area.  (To see why, look at $\\overline{BC}$ and notice that $\\triangle BXF$ and $\\triangle CXF$ have the same area since they share an altitude and have equal base lengths, and $\\triangle ABF$ and $\\triangle ACF$ have the same area for the same reason.  Thus, $\\triangle ABX$ and $\\triangle ACX$ have the same area.  We can repeat this argument with all three sizes of triangles built off the other two sides $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB}$, to see that the six small triangles must all have the same area.)\n\nQuadrilateral $AEXD$ is made up of two of these small triangles and triangle $BXC$ is made up of two of these small triangles as well.  Hence they have the same area (and this will hold true no matter what type of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is).  Thus, the ratio of the area of quadrilateral $AEXD$ to the area of triangle $BXC$ is $1/1=\\boxed{1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and a point $K$ on $BC$ such that $AK$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$. If $AC = 10,$ $BK = 7$, and $BC = 13,$ then what is the area of $\\triangle ABC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we sketch! [asy]\npair A, B, C, K;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-7, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nK = (0, 0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--K);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$K$\", K, NE);\nlabel(\"10\", C--A, NE);\nlabel(\"7\", B--K, N);\nlabel(\"13\", B--C, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,K,B,10));\n[/asy] We now see that $CK = BC - BK = 6.$ That means $\\triangle AKC$ is a $3:4:5$ right triangle, so $AK = 8.$ At this point, we can see that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AK \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{52}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,5)$, and $(7,12)$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The base of the triangle lies on the $y$-axis, and is 5 units long. The height of the triangle is the horizontal distance from the point $(7,12)$ to the $y$-axis, and is 7 units long. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{5\\cdot7}{2}=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In rectangle $ABCD$, side $AB$ measures $6$ units and side $BC$ measures $3$ units, as shown. Points $F$ and $G$ are on side $CD$ with segment $DF$ measuring $1$ unit and segment $GC$ measuring $2$ units, and lines $AF$ and $BG$ intersect at $E$. What is the area of triangle $AEB$? [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(6,0)--(6,3)--(0,3)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(2,6)--(6,0)--cycle);\ndot((0,0));\ndot((6,0));\ndot((6,3));\ndot((0,3));\ndot((1,3));\ndot((4,3));\ndot((2,6));\nlabel(\"A\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"B\",(6,0),SE);\nlabel(\"C\",(6,3),NE);\nlabel(\"D\",(0,3),NW);\nlabel(\"E\",(2,6),N);\nlabel(\"F\",(1,3),SE);\nlabel(\"G\",(4,3),SW);\nlabel(\"6\",(3,0),S);\nlabel(\"1\",(0.5,3),N);\nlabel(\"2\",(5,3),N);\nlabel(\"3\",(6,1.5),E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We first find the length of line segment $FG$. Since $DC$ has length $6$ and $DF$ and $GC$ have lengths $1$ and $2$ respectively, $FG$ must have length $3$. Next, we notice that $DC$ and $AB$ are parallel so $\\angle EFG \\cong \\angle EAB$ because they are corresponding angles. Similarly, $\\angle EGF \\cong \\angle EBA$. Now that we have two pairs of congruent angles, we know that $\\triangle FEG \\sim \\triangle AEB$ by Angle-Angle Similarity.\n\nBecause the two triangles are similar, we have that the ratio of the altitudes of $\\triangle FEG$ to $\\triangle AEB$ equals the ratio of the bases. $FG:AB=3:6=1:2$, so the the ratio of the altitude of $\\triangle FEG$ to that of $\\triangle AEB$ is also $1:2$. Thus, the height of the rectangle $ABCD$ must be half of the altitude of $\\triangle AEB$. Since the height of rectangle $ABCD$ is $3$, the altitude of $\\triangle AEB$ must be $6$. Now that we know that the base and altitude of $\\triangle AEB$ are both $6$, we know that the area of triangle $AEB$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$base $\\times$ height $= (\\frac{1}{2})(6)(6) = \\boxed{18}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In $\\triangle ABC$,  point $D$ is the midpoint of side $BC$.  Point $E$ is on $AC$ such that $AE:EC =1:2$. Point $F$ is on $AD$ such that $AF:FD=3:1$. If the area of $\\triangle DEF$ is 17, determine the area of $\\triangle ABC$.

Therefore, the height of the triangle is the difference in the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$, or $7-1 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = \\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $A(0,0), B(9,6)$ and $C(6,12)$ are vertices of triangle $ABC$. Point $D$ is on segment $AB$ such that $2(AD) = DB$, point $E$ is on segment $BC$ such that $2(BE) = EC$ and point $F$ is on segment $CA$ such that $2(CF) = FA$.
