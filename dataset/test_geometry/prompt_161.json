    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The diagonals of a regular hexagon have two possible lengths. What is the ratio of the shorter length to the longer length? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two possible diagonal lengths are $AB$ and $AC$.  The measure of an interior angle of a regular hexagon is $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees. Therefore, angle $BCA$ measures $120/2=60$ degrees.  Also, the base angles of the isosceles triangle with the marked 120-degree angle each measure $(180-120)/2=30$ degrees. This implies that $\\angle CBA$ is a right angle, so triangle $ABC$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.  Therefore, the ratio of $AB$ to $AC$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.

Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The side length of the regular hexagon is 10 cm. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the shaded region? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\n\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\nfill(B--C--E--F--cycle,heavycyan);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label points $A$, $B$, $C$ as shown below, and let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$. [asy]\n\nsize(120);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\nfill(B--C--E--F--cycle,heavycyan); pair H=(E+C)/2; draw(D--H); draw(E--C); label(\"$A$\",C,NW);label(\"$B$\",D,W);label(\"$C$\",E,SW);label(\"$H$\",H,ESE);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy] Since the hexagon is regular, $\\angle ABC = 120^\\circ$ and $\\angle ABH = \\angle CBH = 120^\\circ / 2 = 60^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\triangle ABH$ and $\\triangle CBH$ are congruent $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangles.  These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince $AB=BC=10$, we have $BH = AB/2 = 5$ and $AH = CH = \\sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $BH$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $AC = 2\\cdot 5\\sqrt{3} = 10\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe shaded region is a rectangle with base length $10$ and height length $10\\sqrt{3}$; its area is $10\\cdot 10\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{100\\sqrt{3}}$ square cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular hexagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 2 units. In square units, what is the area of the hexagon? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect opposite pairs of vertices of the regular hexagon with line segments as shown.  Since each angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees, the six triangles produced are equilateral.  The diameter of the circle circumscribed around the hexagon is equal to twice the side length of each of the triangles.  Therefore, each triangle has side length 2 units.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ units is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$ square units.  (To show this, divide the equilateral triangle into two smaller 30-60-90 triangles.)  Substituting $s=2$, we find that the area of each triangle is $\\sqrt{3}$ square units.  Therefore, area of the hexagon is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(3.5cm);\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\n\nfor(i=0;i<=5;i=i+1)\n\n{\n\ndot((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\ndraw((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6))--(cos(2*pi*(i+1)/6),sin(2*pi*(i+1)/6)));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\n}\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Side $AB$ of regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ is extended past $B$ to point $X$ such that $AX = 3AB$. Given that each side of the hexagon is $2$ units long, what is the length of segment $FX$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $P$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $F$ to the line containing $AB$. [asy]size(150);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7) + fontsize(10)); real lsf = 0.6;\npair C = (2,0), B = 2*dir(60), A = 2*dir(120), F = -C, E = -B, D = -A, P = foot(F,A,B), Y = B+(4,0);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--cycle); draw(F--P--Y--cycle); draw(rightanglemark(F,P,A,5));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,lsf*A); label(\"$B$\",B,lsf*B); label(\"$C$\",C,lsf*C); label(\"$D$\",D,lsf*D); label(\"$E$\",E,lsf*E); label(\"$F$\",F,lsf*F); label(\"$P$\",P,N); label(\"$X$\",Y,N);\n[/asy] Since $\\angle FAB = 120^{\\circ},$ then $\\angle PAF = 180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = 60^{\\circ}$, and it follows that $\\triangle PAF$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle. As $AF = 2$, it follows that $AP = 1$ and $PF = \\sqrt{3}$. Also, $AB = 2$ and so $AX = 3AB = 6$. Thus, $PX = AP + AX = 7$. In right triangle $FPX$, by the Pythagorean Theorem, it follows that $$FX^2 = PF^2 + PX^2 = (\\sqrt{3})^2 + (7)^2 = 52,$$and $FX = \\sqrt{52} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{13}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the number of units in the length of diagonal $DA$ of the regular hexagon shown. Express your answer in simplest radical form.

[asy]\n\nsize(120);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300); label(\"$10$\",(A+B)/2,NE);\npair H=(E+C)/2; draw(D--H); draw(E--C); label(\"$D$\",C,NW);label(\"$X$\",D,W);label(\"$A$\",E,SW);label(\"$Y$\",H,E);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy] Since the hexagon is regular, $\\angle DXA = 120^\\circ$ and $\\angle AXY = \\angle DXY = 120^\\circ / 2 = 60^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\triangle AXY$ and $\\triangle DXY$ are congruent $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangles.  These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince the side length of the hexagon is 10, we have $AX=XD=10$.  It follows that $XY = AX/2 = 5$ and $AY = DY = \\sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $XY$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $DA = 2\\cdot 5\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{10\\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle whose area is $324\\pi$ square units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that since the area is $\\pi r^2 = 324 \\pi$, where $r$ is the radius, we must have $r=\\sqrt{324}=18$. Thus the distance from the center of the hexagon to a vertex is $18$, and we can break up the hexagon into $6$ equilateral triangles, each of which has side length $18$. The area of an equilateral triangle of side length $s$ is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$, so the area of each equilateral triangle is $81 \\sqrt{3}$, making the total $6(81 \\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{486 \\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A parallelogram has adjacent sides of lengths $s$ units and $2s$ units forming a 45-degree angle. The area of the parallelogram is $8\\sqrt 2$ square units. What is the value of $s$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If we let the side of length $2s$ be the base of the parallelogram, we can use our 45-degree angle to find the height of the parallelogram. The height and sides of the parallelogram form a 45-45-90 triangle, with the side of length $s$ as the hypotenuse. Thus, the height of the parallelogram is $s/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nIt follows that the area of the parallelogram is $2s\\cdot (s/\\sqrt{2}) = s^2\\sqrt{2} = 8\\sqrt{2}$, so $s^2 = 8$. Taking the square root of both sides, we see that $s = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular hexagon is inscribed in a circle and another regular hexagon is circumscribed about the same circle. What is the ratio of the area of the larger hexagon to the area of the smaller hexagon? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Form a triangle whose first vertex is the center of the circle and whose other two vertices are the midpoint and one of the endpoints of a side of the larger hexagon, as shown in the diagram.  Since each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees, this triangle is a 30-60-90 right triangle.  Let $r$ be the radius of the circle.  The length of the longer leg of the triangle is $r$, so the length of the shorter leg is $r/\\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $2r/\\sqrt{3}$.  Since for the smaller hexagon the length of the segment connecting a vertex to the center is $r$, the dimensions of the larger hexagon are $2/\\sqrt{3}$ times larger than the dimensions of the smaller hexagon.  Therefore, the area of the larger triangle is $(2/\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$ times greater than the area of the smaller triangle.\n\n[asy]\nsize(5cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));\nfor(i=0;i<=5;++i)\n\n{\n\ndraw(dir(60*i)--dir(60*(i+1)));\n\ndraw(2/sqrt(3)*dir(60*i)--2/sqrt(3)*dir(60*(i+1)));\n\n}\ndraw(2/sqrt(3)*dir(0)--(0,0)--dir(30));\ndraw(0.93*dir(30)--dir(30)+0.07*dir(-60)+0.07*dir(210)--dir(30)+0.07*dir(-60));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many square units are in the area of the parallelogram with vertices at (0, 0), (6, 0), (2, 8) and (8, 8)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The measure of the base of the parallelogram is 6 units and the height of the parallelogram is 8 units.
