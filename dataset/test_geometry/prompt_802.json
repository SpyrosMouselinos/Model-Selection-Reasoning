    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the smallest possible area, in square units, of a right triangle with two sides measuring $4$ units and $5$ units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $5>4$, $4$ cannot be the length of the hypotenuse. Thus either $4$ and $5$ are the lengths of the two smaller sides, or $5$ is the hypotenuse, meaning the two smaller sides are $4$ and $3$. In this latter case, the area will be smaller, so the area is $\\frac{(3)(4)}{2} = \\boxed{6}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the total area, in square units, of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid that has base edges measuring 6 units and lateral edges measuring 5 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The triangular faces are isosceles triangles.  We drop an altitude from the apex to the base, and, since the triangle is isosceles, it will also be a median.  So it forms a right triangle with hypotenuse $5$ and one leg $3$, and thus the other leg, the altitude, is $4$.  The area of the triangle is then $\\frac{4(6)}{2}=12$.  Since there are $4$ triangular faces, the total area is $4(12)=\\boxed{48}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has vertices at $(-3,2),(6,-2),(3,5)$. How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(200);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nreal x = 7;\npair A=(-3,2), B=(6,-2), C=(3,5);\nfill(A--C--(-3,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(B--C--(6,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(A--B--(-3,-2)--cycle,gray(0.6));\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\nxaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\nyaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(-3,2)$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$(6,-2)$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$(3,5)$\",C,N);\ndraw((-3,5)--(6,5)--(6,-2)--(-3,-2)--cycle,dotted);[/asy] We find the area of the given triangle by subtracting the sum of the areas of the three shaded triangles in the figure from the area of the rectangle formed by all four triangles.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $9(7)=63$ square units, and the sum of the areas of the shaded triangles is $$\\frac{1}{2}(6)(3)+\\frac{1}{2}(3)(7)+\\frac{1}{2}(4)(9)=37.5$$ square units.  The area of the fourth triangle is $63-37.5=\\boxed{25.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle in a Cartesian coordinate plane has vertices (5, -2), (10, 5) and (5, 5). How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the given points in a coordinate plane, we find that the triangle is a right triangle whose legs have length $5-(-2)=7$ and $10-5=5$ units.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(7)(5)=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(8));\ndotfactor = 4;\ndraw((-1,0)--(10,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,10),Arrows(4));\npair A=(5,-2), B=(10,5), C=(5,5);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(rotate(90)*\"$5-(-2)$\",(0,0.2)+(A+C)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$10-5$\",(B+C)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$(5,-2)$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$(10,5)$\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"$(5,5)$\",C,NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle whose vertices are at $(4, -1)$, $(10, 3)$ and $(4, 5)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$.  Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two similar right triangles have areas of 6 square inches and 150 square inches. The length of the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches. What is the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the smaller triangle has hypotenuse 5, we guess that it is a 3-4-5 triangle.  Sure enough, the area of a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4 is $(3)(4)/2 = 6$, so this works.  The area of the larger triangle is $150/6=25$ times the area of the smaller triangle, so its side lengths are $\\sqrt{25} = 5$ times as long as the side lengths of the smaller triangle.  Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle is $5(3+4) = \\boxed{35}$.\n\nProof that the only possibility for the smaller triangle is that it is a 3-4-5 triangle: Let's call the legs of the smaller triangle $a$ and $b$ (with $b$ being the longer leg) and the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle $c$. Similarly, let's call the corresponding legs of the larger triangle $A$ and $B$ and the hypotenuse of the larger triangle $C$. Since the area of the smaller triangle is 6 square inches, we can say  $$\\frac{1}{2}ab=6.$$ Additionally, we are told that the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches, so $c=5$ and $$a^2+b^2=25.$$ Because $\\frac{1}{2}ab=6$, we get $ab=12$ or $a=\\frac{12}{b}$. We can now write the equation in terms of $b$. We get \\begin{align*}\na^2+b^2&=25\\\\\n\\left(\\frac{12}{b}\\right)^{2}+b^2&=25\\\\\n12^2+b^4&=25b^2\\\\\nb^4-25b^2+144&=0.\n\\end{align*} Solving for $b$, we get  $$b^4-25b^2+144=(b-4)(b+4)(b-3)(b+3)=0.$$ Since we said that $b$ is the longer of the two legs, $b=4$ and $a=3$. Therefore, the triangle must be a 3-4-5 right triangle.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,5)$, and $(7,12)$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The base of the triangle lies on the $y$-axis, and is 5 units long. The height of the triangle is the horizontal distance from the point $(7,12)$ to the $y$-axis, and is 7 units long. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{5\\cdot7}{2}=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If a triangle has two sides of lengths 5 and 7 units, then how many different integer lengths can the third side be?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $n$ be the length of the third side.  Then by the triangle inequality, \\begin{align*}\nn + 5 &> 7, \\\\\nn + 7 &> 5, \\\\\n5 + 7 &> n,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $n > 2$, $n > -2$, and $n < 12$.  Hence, the possible values of $n$ are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, for a total of $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $A(1, 1), B(6, 1), C(3, 7)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that $AB$ has length 5 and is parallel to the $x$-axis. Therefore, the height of the triangle is the difference in the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$, or $7-1 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = \\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of square units in the area of a triangle whose sides measure 5, 5 and 6 units?\n\nAnswer:\n",
