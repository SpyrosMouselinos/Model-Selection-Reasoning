    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a circle of radius $42$, two chords of length $78$ intersect at a point whose distance from the center is $18$. The two chords divide the interior of the circle into four regions. Two of these regions are bordered by segments of unequal lengths, and the area of either of them can be expressed uniquely in the form $m\\pi-n\\sqrt{d},$ where $m, n,$ and $d$ are positive integers and $d$ is not divisible by the square of any prime number. Find $m+n+d.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the center of the circle be $O$, and the two chords be $\\overline{AB}, \\overline{CD}$ and intersecting at $E$, such that $AE = CE < BE = DE$. Let $F$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$. Then $\\overline{OF} \\perp \\overline{AB}$.\n[asy] size(200); pathpen = black + linewidth(0.7); pen d = dashed+linewidth(0.7); pair O = (0,0), E=(0,18), B=E+48*expi(11*pi/6), D=E+48*expi(7*pi/6), A=E+30*expi(5*pi/6), C=E+30*expi(pi/6), F=foot(O,B,A); D(CR(D(MP(\"O\",O)),42)); D(MP(\"A\",A,NW)--MP(\"B\",B,SE)); D(MP(\"C\",C,NE)--MP(\"D\",D,SW)); D(MP(\"E\",E,N)); D(C--B--O--E,d);D(O--D(MP(\"F\",F,NE)),d); MP(\"39\",(B+F)/2,NE);MP(\"30\",(C+E)/2,NW);MP(\"42\",(B+O)/2); [/asy]\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, $OF = \\sqrt{OB^2 - BF^2} = \\sqrt{42^2 - 39^2} = 9\\sqrt{3}$, and $EF = \\sqrt{OE^2 - OF^2} = 9$. Then $OEF$ is a $30-60-90$ right triangle, so $\\angle OEB = \\angle OED = 60^{\\circ}$. Thus $\\angle BEC = 60^{\\circ}$, and by the Law of Cosines,\n$BC^2 = BE^2 + CE^2 - 2 \\cdot BE \\cdot CE \\cos 60^{\\circ} = 42^2.$\nIt follows that $\\triangle BCO$ is an equilateral triangle, so $\\angle BOC = 60^{\\circ}$. The desired area can be broken up into two regions, $\\triangle BCE$ and the region bounded by $\\overline{BC}$ and minor arc $\\stackrel{\\frown}{BC}$. The former can be found by Heron's formula to be $[BCE] = \\sqrt{60(60-48)(60-42)(60-30)} = 360\\sqrt{3}$. The latter is the difference between the area of sector $BOC$ and the equilateral $\\triangle BOC$, or $\\frac{1}{6}\\pi (42)^2 - \\frac{42^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = 294\\pi - 441\\sqrt{3}$.\nThus, the desired area is $360\\sqrt{3} + 294\\pi - 441\\sqrt{3} = 294\\pi - 81\\sqrt{3}$, and $m+n+d = \\boxed{378}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Centered at each lattice point in the coordinate plane are a circle radius $\\frac{1}{10}$ and a square with sides of length $\\frac{1}{5}$ whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. The line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(1001, 429)$ intersects $m$ of the squares and $n$ of the circles. Find $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First note that $1001 = 143 \\cdot 7$ and $429 = 143 \\cdot 3$ so every point of the form $(7k, 3k)$ is on the line. Then consider the line $l$ from $(7k, 3k)$ to $(7(k + 1), 3(k + 1))$. Translate the line $l$ so that $(7k, 3k)$ is now the origin. There is one square and one circle that intersect the line around $(0,0)$. Then the points on $l$ with an integral $x$-coordinate are, since $l$ has the equation $y = \\frac{3x}{7}$:\n\\[(0,0), \\left(1, \\frac{3}{7}\\right), \\left(2, \\frac{6}{7}\\right), \\left(3, 1 + \\frac{2}{7}\\right), \\left(4, 1 + \\frac{5}{7}\\right), \\left(5, 2 + \\frac{1}{7}\\right), \\left(6, 2 + \\frac{4}{7}\\right), (7,3).\\]\nWe claim that the lower right vertex of the square centered at $(2,1)$ lies on $l$. Since the square has side length $\\frac{1}{5}$, the lower right vertex of this square has coordinates $\\left(2 + \\frac{1}{10},  1 - \\frac{1}{10}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{21}{10}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right)$. Because $\\frac{9}{10} = \\frac{3}{7} \\cdot \\frac{21}{10}$, $\\left(\\frac{21}{10}, \\frac{9}{10}\\right)$ lies on $l$. Since the circle centered at $(2,1)$ is contained inside the square, this circle does not intersect $l$. Similarly the upper left vertex of the square centered at $(5,2)$ is on $l$. Since every other point listed above is farther away from a lattice point (excluding (0,0) and (7,3)) and there are two squares with centers strictly between $(0,0)$ and $(7,3)$ that intersect $l$. Since there are $\\frac{1001}{7} = \\frac{429}{3} = 143$ segments from $(7k, 3k)$ to $(7(k + 1), 3(k + 1))$, the above count is yields $143 \\cdot 2 = 286$ squares. Since every lattice point on $l$ is of the form $(3k, 7k)$ where $0 \\le k \\le 143$, there are $144$ lattice points on $l$. Centered at each lattice point, there is one square and one circle, hence this counts $288$ squares and circles. Thus $m + n = 286 + 288 = \\boxed{574}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ and a semicircle with diameter $AB$ are coplanar and have nonoverlapping interiors. Let $\\mathcal{R}$ denote the region enclosed by the semicircle and the rectangle. Line $\\ell$ meets the semicircle, segment $AB$, and segment $CD$ at distinct points $N$, $U$, and $T$, respectively. Line $\\ell$ divides region $\\mathcal{R}$ into two regions with areas in the ratio $1: 2$. Suppose that $AU = 84$, $AN = 126$, and $UB = 168$. Then $DA$ can be represented as $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\n[asy] import graph; defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10)); size(500); pen zzttqq = rgb(0.6,0.2,0); pen xdxdff = rgb(0.4902,0.4902,1);    /* segments and figures */ draw((0,-154.31785)--(0,0)); draw((0,0)--(252,0)); draw((0,0)--(126,0),zzttqq); draw((126,0)--(63,109.1192),zzttqq); draw((63,109.1192)--(0,0),zzttqq); draw((-71.4052,(+9166.01287-109.1192*-71.4052)/21)--(504.60925,(+9166.01287-109.1192*504.60925)/21)); draw((0,-154.31785)--(252,-154.31785)); draw((252,-154.31785)--(252,0)); draw((0,0)--(84,0)); draw((84,0)--(252,0)); draw((63,109.1192)--(63,0)); draw((84,0)--(84,-154.31785)); draw(arc((126,0),126,0,180));    /* points and labels */ dot((0,0)); label(\"$A$\",(-16.43287,-9.3374),NE/2); dot((252,0)); label(\"$B$\",(255.242,5.00321),NE/2); dot((0,-154.31785)); label(\"$D$\",(3.48464,-149.55669),NE/2); dot((252,-154.31785)); label(\"$C$\",(255.242,-149.55669),NE/2); dot((126,0)); label(\"$O$\",(129.36332,5.00321),NE/2); dot((63,109.1192)); label(\"$N$\",(44.91307,108.57427),NE/2); label(\"$126$\",(28.18236,40.85473),NE/2); dot((84,0)); label(\"$U$\",(87.13819,5.00321),NE/2); dot((113.69848,-154.31785)); label(\"$T$\",(116.61611,-149.55669),NE/2); dot((63,0)); label(\"$N'$\",(66.42398,5.00321),NE/2); label(\"$84$\",(41.72627,-12.5242),NE/2); label(\"$168$\",(167.60494,-12.5242),NE/2); dot((84,-154.31785)); label(\"$T'$\",(87.13819,-149.55669),NE/2); dot((252,0)); label(\"$I$\",(255.242,5.00321),NE/2); clip((-71.4052,-225.24323)--(-71.4052,171.51361)--(504.60925,171.51361)--(504.60925,-225.24323)--cycle); [/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The center of the semicircle is also the midpoint of $AB$. Let this point be O. Let $h$ be the length of $AD$.\nRescale everything by 42, so $AU = 2, AN = 3, UB = 4$. Then $AB = 6$ so $OA = OB = 3$.\nSince $ON$ is a radius of the semicircle, $ON = 3$. Thus $OAN$ is an equilateral triangle.\nLet $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be the areas of triangle $OUN$, sector $ONB$, and trapezoid $UBCT$ respectively.\n$X = \\frac {1}{2}(UO)(NO)\\sin{O} = \\frac {1}{2}(1)(3)\\sin{60^\\circ} = \\frac {3}{4}\\sqrt {3}$\n$Y = \\frac {1}{3}\\pi(3)^2 = 3\\pi$\nTo find $Z$ we have to find the length of $TC$. Project $T$ and $N$ onto $AB$ to get points $T'$ and $N'$. Notice that $UNN'$ and $TUT'$ are similar. Thus:\n$\\frac {TT'}{UT'} = \\frac {UN'}{NN'} \\implies \\frac {TT'}{h} = \\frac {1/2}{3\\sqrt {3}/2} \\implies TT' = \\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{9}h$.\nThen $TC = T'C - T'T = UB - TT' = 4 - \\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{9}h$. So:\n$Z = \\frac {1}{2}(BU + TC)(CB) = \\frac {1}{2}\\left(8 - \\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{9}h\\right)h = 4h - \\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{18}h^2$\nLet $L$ be the area of the side of line $l$ containing regions $X, Y, Z$. Then\n$L = X + Y + Z = \\frac {3}{4}\\sqrt {3} + 3\\pi + 4h - \\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{18}h^2$\nObviously, the $L$ is greater than the area on the other side of line $l$. This other area is equal to the total area minus $L$. Thus:\n$\\frac {2}{1} = \\frac {L}{6h + \\frac {9}{2}{\\pi} - L} \\implies 12h + 9\\pi = 3L$.\nNow just solve for $h$.\n\\begin{align*} 12h + 9\\pi & = \\frac {9}{4}\\sqrt {3} + 9\\pi + 12h - \\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{6}h^2 \\\\ 0 & = \\frac {9}{4}\\sqrt {3} - \\frac {\\sqrt {3}}{6}h^2 \\\\ h^2 & = \\frac {9}{4}(6) \\\\ h & = \\frac {3}{2}\\sqrt {6} \\end{align*}\nDon't forget to un-rescale at the end to get $AD = \\frac {3}{2}\\sqrt {6} \\cdot 42 = 63\\sqrt {6}$.\nFinally, the answer is $63 + 6 = \\boxed{69}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A solid in the shape of a right circular cone is 4 inches tall and its base has a 3-inch radius. The entire surface of the cone, including its base, is painted. A plane parallel to the base of the cone divides the cone into two solids, a smaller cone-shaped solid $C$ and a frustum-shaped solid $F,$ in such a way that the ratio between the areas of the painted surfaces of $C$ and $F$ and the ratio between the volumes of $C$ and $F$ are both equal to $k$. Given that $k=\\frac m n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Our original solid has volume equal to $V = \\frac13 \\pi r^2 h = \\frac13 \\pi 3^2\\cdot 4 = 12 \\pi$ and has surface area $A = \\pi r^2 + \\pi r \\ell$, where $\\ell$ is the slant height of the cone. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we get $\\ell = 5$ and $A = 24\\pi$.\nLet $x$ denote the radius of the small cone. Let $A_c$ and $A_f$ denote the area of the painted surface on cone $C$ and frustum $F$, respectively, and let $V_c$ and $V_f$ denote the volume of cone $C$ and frustum $F$, respectively. Because the plane cut is parallel to the base of our solid, $C$ is similar to the uncut solid and so the height and slant height of cone $C$ are $\\frac{4}{3}x$ and $\\frac{5}{3}x$, respectively. Using the formula for lateral surface area of a cone, we find that $A_c=\\frac{1}{2}c\\cdot \\ell=\\frac{1}{2}(2\\pi x)\\left(\\frac{5}{3}x\\right)=\\frac{5}{3}\\pi x^2$. By subtracting $A_c$ from the surface area of the original solid, we find that $A_f=24\\pi - \\frac{5}{3}\\pi x^2$.\nNext, we can calculate $V_c=\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2h=\\frac{1}{3}\\pi x^2 \\left(\\frac{4}{3}x\\right)=\\frac{4}{9}\\pi x^3$. Finally, we subtract $V_c$ from the volume of the original cone to find that $V_f=12\\pi - \\frac{4}{9}\\pi x^3$. We know that $\\frac{A_c}{A_f}=\\frac{V_c}{V_f}=k.$ Plugging in our values for $A_c$, $A_f$, $V_c$, and $V_f$, we obtain the equation $\\frac{\\frac{5}{3}\\pi x^2}{24\\pi - \\frac{5}{3}\\pi x^2}=\\frac{\\frac{4}{9}\\pi x^3}{12\\pi - \\frac{4}{9}\\pi x^3}$. We can take reciprocals of both sides to simplify this equation to $\\frac{72}{5x^2} - 1 = \\frac{27}{x^3} - 1$ and so $x = \\frac{15}{8}$. Then $k = \\frac{\\frac{5}{3}\\pi x^2}{24\\pi - \\frac{5}{3}\\pi x^2}= \\frac{125}{387} = \\frac mn$ so the answer is $m+n=125+387=\\boxed{512}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The perimeter of triangle $APM$ is $152$, and the angle $PAM$ is a right angle. A circle of radius $19$ with center $O$ on $\\overline{AP}$ is drawn so that it is tangent to $\\overline{AM}$ and $\\overline{PM}$. Given that $OP=m/n$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the circle intersect $\\overline{PM}$ at $B$. Then note $\\triangle OPB$ and $\\triangle MPA$ are similar. Also note that $AM = BM$ by power of a point. Using the fact that the ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their perimeters, we have\\[\\frac{19}{AM} = \\frac{152-2AM-19+19}{152} = \\frac{152-2AM}{152}\\]Solving, $AM = 38$. So the ratio of the side lengths of the triangles is 2. Therefore,\\[\\frac{PB+38}{OP}= 2 \\text{ and } \\frac{OP+19}{PB} = 2\\]so $2OP = PB+38$ and $2PB = OP+19.$ Substituting for $PB$, we see that $4OP-76 = OP+19$, so $OP = \\frac{95}3$ and the answer is $\\boxed{98}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A hexagon inscribed in a circle has three consecutive sides, each of length 3, and three consecutive sides, each of length 5. The chord of the circle that divides the hexagon into two trapezoids, one with three sides, each of length 3, and the other with three sides, each of length 5, has length equal to $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In hexagon $ABCDEF$, let $AB=BC=CD=3$ and let $DE=EF=FA=5$. Since arc $BAF$ is one third of the circumference of the circle, it follows that $\\angle BCF = \\angle BEF=60^{\\circ}$. Similarly, $\\angle CBE =\\angle CFE=60^{\\circ}$.

All these circles are homothetic with respect to a center at $(5,0)$.\n[asy] pair truck(pair P){  pair Q = IP(P--P+(7/10,24/10),(35/31,35/31)--(5,0));   D(P--Q,EndArrow(5)); D(CP(P,Q),linewidth(0.5));  return Q; } pointpen = black; pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); size(250); pair B=(5,0), C=(35/31,35/31); D(D(B)--D(C)--D(B*dir(90))--D(C*dir(90))--D(B*dir(180))--D(C*dir(180))--D(B*dir(270))--D(C*dir(270))--cycle); D((-6,0)--(6,0),Arrows(4)); D((0,-6)--(0,6),Arrows(4)); truck((1,0)); truck((2,0)); truck((3,0)); truck((4,0));  [/asy]     [asy]  pointpen = black; pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); size(250); pair O=(0,0), B=(5,0), A=1.4*expi(atan(24/7)), C=1.4*expi(atan(7/24)); D(D(B)--D(A)--D(O)); D(O--D(C)--D(B*dir(90))--D(A*dir(90))--O--D(C*dir(90))--D(B*dir(180))--D(A*dir(180))--O--D(C*dir(180))--D(B*dir(270))--D(A*dir(270))--O--D(C*dir(270))--B,linewidth(0.5)); D(CR(O,1.4));  D((-6,0)--(6,0),Arrows(4)); D((0,-6)--(0,6),Arrows(4)); MP(\"A\",A,N); MP(\"B\",B); MP(\"(5,0)\",B,N); D(MP(\"\\left(\\frac{35}{31},\\frac{35}{31}\\right)\",(35/31,35/31),NE)); D(rightanglemark(O,A,B)); [/asy]\nNow consider the circle at $(0,0)$. Draw a line tangent to it at $A$ and passing through $B (5,0)$. By the Pythagorean Theorem $AB^2+AO^2=OB^2 \\Longrightarrow AB=\\sqrt{OB^2-AO^2}=\\sqrt{5^2-1.4^2}=\\frac{24}{5}$. Then $\\tan(\\angle ABO)=\\frac{OA}{AB}=\\frac{7}{24}$, so the slope of line $AB$ is $\\frac{-7}{24}$. Since it passes through $(5,0)$ its equation is $y=\\frac{-7}{24}(x-5)$.\nThis line and the x and y axis bound the region the truck can go if it moves in the positive x direction. Similarly, the line $y=5-\\frac{24}{7}x$ bounds the region the truck can go if it moves in positive y direction. The intersection of these two lines is $\\left(\\frac{35}{31},\\frac{35}{31}\\right)$. The bounded region in Quadrant I is made up of a square and two triangles. $A=x^2+x(5-x)=5x$. By symmetry, the regions in the other quadrants are the same, so the area of the whole region is $20x=\\frac{700}{31}$ so the answer is $700+31=\\boxed{731}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $ABCDE$ be a convex pentagon with $AB \\parallel CE, BC \\parallel AD, AC \\parallel DE, \\angle ABC=120^\\circ, AB=3, BC=5,$ and $DE = 15.$ Given that the ratio between the area of triangle $ABC$ and the area of triangle $EBD$ is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the intersection of $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{CE}$ be $F$. Since $AB \\parallel CE, BC \\parallel AD,$ it follows that $ABCF$ is a parallelogram, and so $\\triangle ABC \\cong \\triangle CFA$. Also, as $AC \\parallel DE$, it follows that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle EFD$.\n[asy] pointpen = black; pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7);  pair D=(0,0), E=(15,0), F=IP(CR(D, 75/7), CR(E, 45/7)), A=D+ (5+(75/7))/(75/7) * (F-D), C = E+ (3+(45/7))/(45/7) * (F-E), B=IP(CR(A,3), CR(C,5));  D(MP(\"A\",A,(1,0))--MP(\"B\",B,N)--MP(\"C\",C,NW)--MP(\"D\",D)--MP(\"E\",E)--cycle); D(D--A--C--E); D(MP(\"F\",F)); MP(\"5\",(B+C)/2,NW); MP(\"3\",(A+B)/2,NE); MP(\"15\",(D+E)/2); [/asy]\nBy the Law of Cosines, $AC^2 = 3^2 + 5^2 - 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cos 120^{\\circ} = 49 \\Longrightarrow AC = 7$. Thus the length similarity ratio between $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle EFD$ is $\\frac{AC}{ED} = \\frac{7}{15}$.\nLet $h_{ABC}$ and $h_{BDE}$ be the lengths of the altitudes in $\\triangle ABC, \\triangle BDE$ to $AC, DE$ respectively. Then, the ratio of the areas $\\frac{[ABC]}{[BDE]} = \\frac{\\frac 12 \\cdot h_{ABC} \\cdot AC}{\\frac 12 \\cdot h_{BDE} \\cdot DE} = \\frac{7}{15} \\cdot \\frac{h_{ABC}}{h_{BDE}}$.\nHowever, $h_{BDE} = h_{ABC} + h_{CAF} + h_{EFD}$, with all three heights oriented in the same direction. Since $\\triangle ABC \\cong \\triangle CFA$, it follows that $h_{ABC} = h_{CAF}$, and from the similarity ratio, $h_{EFD} = \\frac{15}{7}h_{ABC}$. Hence $\\frac{h_{ABC}}{h_{BDE}} = \\frac{h_{ABC}}{2h_{ABC} + \\frac {15}7h_{ABC}} = \\frac{7}{29}$, and the ratio of the areas is $\\frac{7}{15} \\cdot \\frac 7{29} = \\frac{49}{435}$. The answer is $m+n = \\boxed{484}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n One hundred concentric circles with radii $1,2,3,\\ldots,100$ are drawn in a plane. The interior of the circle of radius $1$ is colored red, and each region bounded by consecutive circles is colored either red or green, with no two adjacent regions the same color. The ratio of the total area of the green regions to the area of the circle of radius 100 can be expressed as $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n\nAnswer:\n",
