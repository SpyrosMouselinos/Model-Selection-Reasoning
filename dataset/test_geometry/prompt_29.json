    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles, obtuse triangle has one angle with a degree measure that is 50$\\%$ larger than the measure of a right angle. What is the measure, in degrees, of one of the two smallest angles in the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n An angle with measure $50\\%$ larger than the measure of a right angle has measure $\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot 90^{\\circ}=135^{\\circ}$.\n\nThus the other two angles have a combined measure of $45^{\\circ}$. Each one has a measure of\n\n$$\\frac{45^{\\circ}}{2}=\\boxed{22.5^{\\circ}}.$$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The consecutive angles of a particular trapezoid form an arithmetic sequence.  If the largest angle measures $120^{\\circ}$, what is the measure of the smallest angle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the angles be $a$, $a + d$, $a + 2d$, and $a + 3d$, from smallest to largest. Note that the sum of the measures of the smallest and largest angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the second smallest and second largest angles. This means that the sum of the measures of the smallest and largest angles is equal to half of the total degrees in the trapezoid, or $180^\\circ$. Since the largest angle measures $120^\\circ$, the smallest must measure $180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = \\boxed{60^\\circ}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with angle $B$ congruent to angle $C$. The measure of angle $C$ is four times the measure of angle $A$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $B$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $x$ be the number of degrees in $\\angle A$. Then $\\angle C=4x^\\circ$, and $\\angle B$ is also $4x^\\circ$ (since $\\angle B$ is congruent to $\\angle C$).\n\nSince the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we have $$x + 4x + 4x = 180,$$ which we can solve for $x=20$. Therefore, $\\angle B = 4\\cdot 20 = \\boxed{80}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measure of each exterior angle of a regular polygon is $30$ degrees. What is the sum of the measures of the interior angles, in degrees?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Taking one exterior angle per vertex, the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$. If each exterior angle is $30^\\circ$, then the polygon has $\\frac{360}{30}=12$ sides. The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$, so for a polygon with 12 sides, the sum of the interior angles is $180(12-2)=\\boxed{1800}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ are isosceles with $AB=BC$ and $AD=DC$. Point $D$ is inside $\\triangle ABC$, $\\angle ABC = 40^\\circ$, and $\\angle ADC = 140^\\circ$.  What is the degree measure of $\\angle\nBAD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, \\[\n\\angle BAC=\\frac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\left( 180^{\\circ}-\\angle ABC\\displaystyle\\right)=70^{\\circ}.\n\\] [asy]\npair A,B,C,D;\nA=(-5,0); B=(0,21); C=(5,0); D=(0,6);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw(A--D--C--cycle,linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$140^{\\circ}$\",(0,4),S);\nlabel(\"$40^{\\circ}$\",(0,15),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\n[/asy] Similarly, \\[\n\\angle DAC=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( 180^{\\circ}-\\angle\nADC\\right)=20^{\\circ}.\n\\]  Thus \\[\\angle BAD = \\angle BAC - \\angle DAC\n= \\boxed{50^{\\circ}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In an isosceles triangle, one of the angles opposite an equal side is $40^{\\circ}$. How many degrees are in the measure of the triangle's largest angle? [asy] draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(3,2)--(0,0)); label(\"$\\backslash$\",(1.5,1)); label(\"{/}\",(4.5,1));\nlabel(\"$40^{\\circ}$\",(.5,0),dir(45));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two angles opposite the equal sides of an isosceles triangle are congruent, so in this case, both are $40^\\circ$. Since the three angles of a triangle add up to $180^\\circ$, the third angle in this triangle is $(180-40-40)^\\circ = \\boxed{100}^\\circ$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles trapezoid is circumscribed around a circle. The longer base of the trapezoid is $16$, and one of the base angles is $\\arcsin(.8)$. Find the area of the trapezoid.\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 72\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 75\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 80\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 90\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{not uniquely determined}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the trapezium have diagonal legs of length $x$ and a shorter base of length $y$. Drop altitudes from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base to form two right-angled triangles, which are congruent since the trapezium is isosceles. Thus using the base angle of $\\arcsin(0.8)$ gives the vertical side of these triangles as $0.8x$ and the horizontal side as $0.6x$. Now notice that the sides of the trapezium can be seen as being made up of tangents to the circle, and thus using the fact that \"the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length\" gives $2y + 0.6x + 0.6x = 2x$. Also, using the given length of the longer base tells us that $y + 0.6x + 0.6x = 16$. Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x=10$ and $y=4$, so the height of the trapezium is $0.8 \\times 10 = 8$. Thus the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(4+16)(8) = \\boxed{80}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is an obtuse, isosceles triangle. Angle $A$ measures 20 degrees. What is number of degrees in the measure of the largest interior angle of triangle $ABC$?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((-20,0)--(0,8)--(20,0)--cycle);\nlabel(\"$20^{\\circ}$\",(-13,-0.7),NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-20,0),W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,8),N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(20,0),E);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, $\\angle C = 20$ degrees. Thus, $\\angle B = 180 - 20 - 20 = 140$ degrees. So the largest interior angle is $\\boxed{140}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The degree measures of the angles in a convex 18-sided polygon form an increasing arithmetic sequence with integer values. Find the degree measure of the smallest angle.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The average angle in an 18-gon is $160^\\circ$. In an arithmetic sequence the average is the same as the median, so the middle two terms of the sequence average to $160^\\circ$. Thus for some positive (the sequence is increasing and thus non-constant) integer $d$, the middle two terms are $(160-d)^\\circ$ and $(160+d)^\\circ$. Since the step is $2d$ the last term of the sequence is $(160 + 17d)^\\circ$, which must be less than $180^\\circ$, since the polygon is convex. This gives $17d < 20$, so the only suitable positive integer $d$ is 1. The first term is then $(160-17)^\\circ = \\boxed{143}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An equilateral triangle has sides 8 units long. An equilateral triangle with sides 4 units long is cut off at the top, leaving an isosceles trapezoid. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the trapezoid? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect the midpoints of the sides of the equilateral triangle as shown.  The triangle is divided into four congruent equilateral triangles, and the isosceles trapezoid is made up of 3 of these 4 triangles.  Therefore, the ratio of the area of one of the triangles to the area of the trapezoid is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(12mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=3;\n\ndraw((0,0)--dir(0)--2*dir(0)--dir(60)+(1,0)--dir(60)--cycle);\n\ndraw(dir(60)+(1,0)--dir(0)--dir(60)--2*dir(60)--cycle);\n\ndot((0,0));\ndot(2*dir(0));\ndot(2*dir(60));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The largest interior angle in an isosceles trapezoid is 4 times the measure of the smallest interior angle.
