    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When a right triangle is rotated about one leg, the volume of the cone produced is $800\\pi \\;\\textrm{ cm}^3$. When the triangle is rotated about the other leg, the volume of the cone produced is $1920\\pi \\;\\textrm{ cm}^3$. What is the length (in cm) of the hypotenuse of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let one leg of the triangle have length $a$ and let the other leg have length $b$. When we rotate around the leg of length $a$, the result is a cone of height $a$ and radius $b$, and so of volume $\\frac 13 \\pi ab^2 = 800\\pi$. Likewise, when we rotate around the leg of length $b$ we get a cone of height $b$ and radius $a$ and so of volume $\\frac13 \\pi b a^2 = 1920 \\pi$. If we divide this equation by the previous one, we get $\\frac ab = \\frac{\\frac13 \\pi b a^2}{\\frac 13 \\pi ab^2} = \\frac{1920}{800} = \\frac{12}{5}$, so $a = \\frac{12}{5}b$. Then $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{12}{5}b\\right)b^2 = 800\\pi$ so $b^3 = 1000$ and $b = 10$ so $a = 24$. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse has length $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\boxed{26}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn.

So, the sector has arc length $2\\cdot \\pi \\cdot 6 = 12\\pi$ and radius $10$.  A full circle with radius 10 has arc length $2\\cdot \\pi \\cdot 10 = 20\\pi$, so the sector has $\\frac{12\\pi}{20\\pi}=\\frac{3}{5}$ of the circle's arc length and thus has 3/5 of the circle's area.

The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.

If the area of the upper base (which is also the base of the small cone) is $25\\pi$ sq cm, then its radius is $5$ cm, and the radius of the lower base is $15$ cm.   The upper base, therefore, has a radius that is $\\frac{1}{3}$ the size of the radius of the smaller base.  Because the slope of the sides of a cone is uniform, the frustum must have been cut off $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way up the cone, so $x$ is $\\frac13$ of the total height of the cone, $H$.  We can now solve for $x$, because we know that the height of the frustum, $24$ cm is $\\frac23$ of the total height. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2}{3}H&=24\\\\\nH&=36\\\\\nx&=H\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx&=36\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx&=12\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the height of the small cone is $\\boxed{12}$ centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylinder with a height of 5 inches has a radius of 2 inches.

The height of the cone is 4 cm. How many centimeters is the circumference of the base of the cone, in terms of $\\pi$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. We're given that the volume is $12\\pi$ and the height is $4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 = 12\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$.

The ratio of the base to the height of an equilateral triangle is 1 to $\\sqrt{3}/2$. In terms of the radius, $r$, the base is $2r$ and the height is $2r\\sqrt{3}/2$, or $r\\sqrt{3}$.

Dividing both sides of the equation by $\\pi$ gives  $(1/3)r^3\\sqrt{3} = 12288$. Tripling both sides, we get $r^3\\sqrt{3} = 36,\\!864$. Now, we want $r\\sqrt{3},$ so we multiply both sides by $3$ to get $r^3\\cdot(\\sqrt{3})^3 = (r\\sqrt{3})^3 = 36,\\!864 \\cdot 3 = 110,\\!592.$ Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $r\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{48.0}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A section is cut out of a circular piece of paper having radius four inches, as shown.
