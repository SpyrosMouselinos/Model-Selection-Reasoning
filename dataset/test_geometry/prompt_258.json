    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Parallelogram $ABCD$ with $A(2,5)$, $B(4,9)$, $C(6,5)$, and $D(4,1)$ is reflected across the $x$-axis to $A'B'C'D'$ and then $A'B'C'D'$ is reflected across the line $y=x+1$ to $A''B''C''D''$. This is done such that $D'$ is the image of $D$, and $D''$ is the image of $D'$. What is the ordered pair of $D''$ in the coordinate plane?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Reflecting a point across the $x$-axis multiplies its $y$-coordinate by $-1$.  Therefore, $D'=(4,-1)$.  To reflect $D'$ across the line $y=x+1$, we first translate both the line and the point down one unit so that the equation of the translated line is $y=x$ and the coordinates of the translated point are $(4,-2)$.  To reflect across $y=x$, we switch the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate to obtain $(-2,4)$.  Translating this point one unit up, we find that $D''=\\boxed{(-2,5)}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $(1,-5)$ and $(11,7)$ are the opposite vertices of a parallelogram.  What are the coordinates of the point where the diagonals of the parallelogram intersect?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The diagonals of a parallelogram intersect at the midpoint of each diagonal. So, we simply find the midpoint of $(1,-5)$ and $(11,7)$, which is $\\left(\\frac{1+11}{2}, \\frac{-5+7}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{(6,1)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $A(-4,1), B(-1,4)$ and $C(-1,1)$ are the vertices of $\\triangle ABC$. What will be the coordinates of the image of point A if $\\triangle ABC$ is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n When we rotate images $90^{\\circ}$ the coordinates switch places, and the signs are adjusted based on whether or not an axis was crossed. In this case, rotating point $A$ $90^{\\circ}$ will bring it across the $y$-axis into Quadrant I, which means both the $x$ and $y$ will be positive. The original point $A$ was at $(-4, 1)$ so the final image will be at $(1, 4)$. We also could solve this problem by seeing that the slope of the segment from the origin to $A$ is $-1/4$. If $A$ is moving to a location that is a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation about the origin, it will move to a point on the segment perpendicular to the one that currently connects it to the origin. This will be the segment that has a slope of 4/1 or $-4/-1$ from the origin which puts us at $(1, 4)$ or $(-1, -4)$. The point $\\boxed{(1, 4)}$ is in the clockwise direction we need.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Each vertex of this parallelogram has integer coordinates. The perimeter of this parallelogram is $p$ units, while the area is $a$ square units. What is the value of the sum $p + a$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(5cm,5cm);\ndraw((-2,0)--(11,0));\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,4)--(10,4)--(7,0)--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(3,4)$\",(3,4),NW);\nlabel(\"$(7,0)$\",(7,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the bottom side of the parallelogram is 7 units, and the length of the left side of the parallelogram is $\\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5$ units, by the Pythagorean theorem.  Since the opposite two sides are congruent to these two, the perimeter of the parallelogram is $5+7+5+7=24$ units.  The area of the parallelogram is equal to its base times its height, which is $(7)(4)=28$ square units.  Therefore, $p+a=24+28=\\boxed{52}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In parallelogram $ABCD$, $AB = 38$ cm, $BC = 3y^3$ cm, $CD = 2x +4$ cm, and $AD = 24$ cm. What is the product of $x$ and $y$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since opposite sides of a parallelogram have the same length, we have the equations $$AB=CD\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad38=2x+4\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad x=17$$and $$BC=AD\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad3y^3=24\\qquad\\Rightarrow\\qquad y=2.$$The product of $x$ and $y$ is then $17\\cdot2=\\boxed{34}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $F$ is taken on the extension of side $AD$ of parallelogram $ABCD$. $BF$ intersects diagonal $AC$ at $E$ and side $DC$ at $G$. If $EF = 32$ and $GF = 24$, then $BE$ equals:\n[asy] size(7cm); pair A = (0, 0), B = (7, 0), C = (10, 5), D = (3, 5), F = (5.7, 9.5); pair G = intersectionpoints(B--F, D--C)[0]; pair E = intersectionpoints(A--C, B--F)[0]; draw(A--D--C--B--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(D--F--B); label(\"$A$\", A, SW); label(\"$B$\", B, SE); label(\"$C$\", C, NE); label(\"$D$\", D, NW); label(\"$F$\", F, N); label(\"$G$\", G, NE); label(\"$E$\", E, SE); //Credit to MSTang for the asymptote[/asy]\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 4 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 8\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 10 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 12 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 16$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $BE = x$ and $BC = y$. Since $AF \\parallel BC$, by AA Similarity, $\\triangle AFE \\sim \\triangle CBE$. That means $\\frac{AF}{CB} = \\frac{FE}{BE}$. Substituting in values results in\\[\\frac{AF}{y} = \\frac{32}{x}\\]Thus, $AF = \\frac{32y}{x}$, so $FD = \\frac{32y - xy}{x}$.\nIn addition, $DC \\parallel AB$, so by AA Similarity, $\\triangle FDG = \\triangle FAB$. That means\\[\\frac{\\frac{32y-xy}{x}}{\\frac{32y}{x}} = \\frac{24}{x+32}\\]Cross multiply to get\\[\\frac{y(32-x)}{x} (x+32) = \\frac{32y}{x} \\cdot 24\\]Since $x \\ne 0$ and $y \\ne 0$,\\[(32-x)(32+x) = 32 \\cdot 24\\]\\[32^2 - x^2 = 32 \\cdot 24\\]\\[32 \\cdot 8 = x^2\\]Thus, $x = \\boxed{16}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of square units in the area of trapezoid ABCD with vertices A(0,0), B(0,-2), C(4,0), and D(4,6)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plot the plots and observe that the bases of the trapezoid are $AB$ and $CD$.  The area of the trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the bases times the height: $\\frac{1}{2}(AB+CD)(AC)=\\frac{1}{2}(2+6)(4)=\\boxed{16}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\npair A=(0,0), B=(0,-2), C=(4,0), D=(4,6);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\nxaxis(-3,8,Arrows(4));\nyaxis(-3,8,Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Parallelogram $ABCD$ has vertices $A(3,3)$, $B(-3,-3)$, $C(-9,-3)$, and $D(-3,3)$. If a point is selected at random from the region determined by the parallelogram, what is the probability that the point is not above the $x$-axis? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let us first call the point where the $x$-axis intersects side $\\overline{AB}$ point $E$ and where it intersects $\\overline{CD}$ point $F$.

Since the height of each of these parallelograms is $3$ and the length of their bases equals $AD=BC=6$, both parallelograms must have the same area. Half of parallelogram $ABCD$'s area is above the $x$-axis and half is below, so there is a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that the point selected is not above the $x$-axis.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ has sides $\\overline {AB}$ of length 4 and $\\overline {CB}$ of length 3. Divide $\\overline {AB}$ into 168 congruent segments with points $A=P_0, P_1, \\ldots, P_{168}=B$, and divide $\\overline {CB}$ into 168 congruent segments with points $C=Q_0, Q_1, \\ldots, Q_{168}=B$. For $1 \\le k \\le 167$, draw the segments $\\overline {P_kQ_k}$. Repeat this construction on the sides $\\overline {AD}$ and $\\overline {CD}$, and then draw the diagonal $\\overline {AC}$.

For each $k$, $\\overline{P_kQ_k}$ is the hypotenuse of a $3-4-5$ right triangle with sides of $3 \\cdot \\frac{168-k}{168}, 4 \\cdot \\frac{168-k}{168}$.
