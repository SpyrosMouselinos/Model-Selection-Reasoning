Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ is the base of pyramid $PABCD$.

The area of the base is $[ABCD] = (AB)(BC) = 32$, and the height from the apex to the base is 6, so the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac13(32)(6) = \\boxed{64}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ is the base of pyramid $PABCD$. If $AB = 8$, $BC = 4$, $\\overline{PA}\\perp \\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{PA}\\perp \\overline{AB}$, and $PB = 17$, then what is the volume of $PABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (4,8,0);\ntriple B= (4,0,0);\ntriple C = (0,0,0);\ntriple D = (0,8,0);\ntriple P = (4,8,6);\ndraw(B--P--D--A--B);\ndraw(A--P);\ndraw(C--P, dashed);\ndraw(B--C--D,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\overline{PA}$ is perpendicular to both $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{AD}$, the segment $\\overline{PA}$ is the altitude from the apex to the base of the pyramid.   To find this length, consider right triangle $PAB$.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem gives $PA = \\sqrt{PB^2 - AB^2} = 15$.\n\nThe area of the base is $[ABCD] = (AB)(BC) = 32$, so the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac13(32)(15) = \\boxed{160}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ is the base of right pyramid $\\allowbreak PABCDEF$.  If $PAD$ is an equilateral triangle with side length 8, then what is the volume of the pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (1,0,0);\ntriple B = (0.5,sqrt(3)/2,0);\ntriple C = (-0.5,sqrt(3)/2,0);\ntriple D = (-1,0,0);\ntriple EE = (-0.5,-sqrt(3)/2,0);\ntriple F = (0.5,-sqrt(3)/2,0);\n\ntriple P = (0,0,1);\n\ndraw(F--A--B--C);\ndraw(C--D--EE--F,dashed);\ndraw(A--P--C);\ndraw(EE--P--D,dashed);\ndraw(B--P--F);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\nlabel(\"$E$\",EE,S);\ndraw(A--D,dashed);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,W);\ndraw(EE--B,dashed);\ndraw(C--F,dashed);\ntriple O = (0,0,0);\ndraw(P--O,dashed);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,S);\n[/asy]\n\nDrawing the long diagonals of a regular hexagon divides the hexagon into equilateral triangles with side length equal to half the length of each long diagonal.  So, the area of the base equals 6 times the area of an equilateral triangle with side length 4.  An equilateral triangle with side length 4 has area $4^2\\sqrt{3}/4 = 4\\sqrt{3}$, so the area of the base of the pyramid is $6(4\\sqrt{3}) = 24\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nLet $O$ be the center of the hexagon, so $\\overline{PO}$ is the altitude from the apex of the pyramid.  Since triangle $PAD$ is an equilateral triangle, triangle $POA$ is a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse 8.  $\\overline{PO}$ is opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle in this triangle, so $PO = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFinally, the volume of the pyramid is  \\[\\frac13\\cdot [ABCDEF] \\cdot PO = \\frac13\\cdot 24\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 4\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{96}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid is formed on a $6\\times 8$ rectangular base. The four edges joining the apex to the corners of the rectangular base each have length $13$. What is the volume of the pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know the rectangular base of the pyramid has area $48$. To find the volume, we must also determine the height.\n\nLet the rectangular base be $ABCD$. Let the apex of the pyramid be $X$, and let $O$ be the foot of the perpendicular drawn from $X$ to face $ABCD$: [asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport three;\ntriple A = (-3,-4,0);\ntriple B = (-3,4,0);\ntriple C = (3,4,0);\ntriple D = (3,-4,0);\ntriple O = (0,0,0);\ntriple X = (0,0,12);\ndraw(B--C--D--A--B--X--D);\ndraw(X--C); draw(A--X--O--D,dashed);\ndot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(O); dot(X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,W);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,ESE);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,N);\ndraw(O+(X-O)/19.2--O+(X-O)/19.2+(D-O)/8--O+(D-O)/8);\n[/asy] Then by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\begin{align*}\n13^2 &= OX^2+OA^2 = OX^2+OB^2 \\\\\n&= OX^2+OC^2 = OX^2+OD^2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $OA=OB=OC=OD$, so $O$ must be the center of the rectangle (where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet). This is also the point where the diagonals of $ABCD$ bisect each other. Each diagonal of $ABCD$ has length $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$, so we have $OA=OB=OC=OD=5$.\n\nThus $OX=\\sqrt{13^2-OD^2} = \\sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$, and so the height of the pyramid is $12$. The volume is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac 13\\cdot (\\text{area of base})\\cdot (\\text{height}) &= \\frac 13\\cdot 48\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= 16\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{192}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The rectangle $ABCD$ below has dimensions $AB = 12 \\sqrt{3}$ and $BC = 13 \\sqrt{3}$. Diagonals $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{BD}$ intersect at $P$. If triangle $ABP$ is cut out and removed, edges $\\overline{AP}$ and $\\overline{BP}$ are joined, and the figure is then creased along segments $\\overline{CP}$ and $\\overline{DP}$, we obtain a triangular pyramid, all four of whose faces are isosceles triangles. Find the volume of this pyramid.\n[asy] pair D=origin, A=(13,0), B=(13,12), C=(0,12), P=(6.5, 6); draw(B--C--P--D--C^^D--A); filldraw(A--P--B--cycle, gray, black); label(\"$A$\", A, SE); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, NW); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$P$\", P, N); label(\"$13\\sqrt{3}$\", A--D, S); label(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\", A--B, E);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $\\triangle{ABC}$ (or the triangle with sides $12\\sqrt {3}$, $13\\sqrt {3}$, $13\\sqrt {3}$) be the base of our tetrahedron. We set points $C$ and $D$ as $(6\\sqrt {3}, 0, 0)$ and $( - 6\\sqrt {3}, 0, 0)$, respectively. Using Pythagoras, we find $A$ as $(0, \\sqrt {399}, 0)$. We know that the vertex of the tetrahedron ($P$) has to be of the form $(x, y, z)$, where $z$ is the altitude of the tetrahedron. Since the distance from $P$ to points $A$, $B$, and $C$ is $\\frac {\\sqrt {939}}{2}$, we can write three equations using the distance formula:\n\\begin{align*} x^{2} + (y - \\sqrt {399})^{2} + z^{2} &= \\frac {939}{4}\\\\ (x - 6\\sqrt {3})^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} &= \\frac {939}{4}\\\\ (x + 6\\sqrt {3})^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} &= \\frac {939}{4} \\end{align*}\nSubtracting the last two equations, we get $x = 0$. Solving for $y,z$ with a bit of effort, we eventually get $x = 0$, $y = \\frac {291}{2\\sqrt {399}}$, $z = \\frac {99}{\\sqrt {133}}$. Since the area of a triangle is $\\frac {1}{2}\\cdot bh$, we have the base area as $18\\sqrt {133}$. Thus, the volume is $V = \\frac {1}{3}\\cdot18\\sqrt {133}\\cdot\\frac {99}{\\sqrt {133}} = 6\\cdot99 = \\boxed{594}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of one lateral face of a right pyramid with an equilateral triangular base is 75 square meters. If the slant height is 30 meters, what is the length of the side of its base, in meters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $s$ represent the sidelength of the equilateral triangular base. Each face of the pyramid has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}bh=75$, where $b$ is the sidelength of the base and $h$ is the slant height of 30 meters. We have  $$75=\\frac{1}{2}s(30)=15s.$$So, $s=5$ and the sidelength of the base is $\\boxed{5}$ meters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle PQR$ be a triangle in the plane, and let $S$ be a point outside the plane of $\\triangle PQR$, so that $SPQR$ is a pyramid whose faces are all triangles.\n\nSuppose that every edge of $SPQR$ has length $18$ or $41$, but no face of $SPQR$ is equilateral. Then what is the surface area of $SPQR$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since all edges of pyramid $SPQR$ have length $18$ or $41$, each triangular face must be isosceles: either $18$-$18$-$41$ or $18$-$41$-$41$. But the first of these two sets of side lengths violates the triangle inequality, since $18+18<41$. Therefore, every face of $SPQR$ must have sides of lengths $18,$ $41,$ and $41$.\n\nTo find the area of each face, we draw an $18$-$41$-$41$ triangle with altitude $h$: [asy]\nsize(4cm);\npair a=(0,40); pair b=(-9,0); pair c=(9,0); pair o=(0,0);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); draw(a--b--c--a); draw(a--o,dashed); draw(rightanglemark(a,o,c,60));\nlabel(\"$h$\",(a+2*o)/3,SE);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+c)/2,E);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+c)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+b)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+b)/2,N);\n[/asy] Since the triangle is isosceles, we know the altitude bisects the base (as marked above). By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $9^2+h^2=41^2$ and thus $h=40$. So, the triangle has area $\\frac 12\\cdot 18\\cdot 40 = 360$.\n\nThe surface area of pyramid $SPQR$ is made up of four such triangles, so it amounts to $4\\cdot 360 = \\boxed{1440}$.\n\n${\\bf Remark.}$  One might wonder whether a pyramid with the properties enumerated in the problem actually exists. The answer is yes! To form such a pyramid, imagine attaching two $18$-$41$-$41$ triangles (like that in the diagram) along their short edges, so that the triangles are free to rotate around that hinge: [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple a=(9,0,0); triple b=-a; triple c=(0,sqrt(1519),-9); triple d=(0,sqrt(1519),9);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); dot(d);\ndraw(surface(a--b--c--cycle),orange,nolight);\ndraw(b--c--a);\ndraw(surface(a--b--d--cycle),yellow,nolight);\ndraw(b--d--a--b);\ndraw(c--d,dashed);\n[/asy] Now you can adjust the distance between the two \"free\" vertices (the dotted line in the diagram above) so that it is $18$. Adding that edge to the diagram and filling in, we have a pyramid with the desired properties.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $ABCD$, a rectangle with $AB = 12$ and $BC = 16$, is the base of pyramid $P$, which has a height of $24$. A plane parallel to $ABCD$ is passed through $P$, dividing $P$ into a frustum $F$ and a smaller pyramid $P'$. Let $X$ denote the center of the circumsphere of $F$, and let $T$ denote the apex of $P$. If the volume of $P$ is eight times that of $P'$, then the value of $XT$ can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute the value of $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n As we are dealing with volumes, the ratio of the volume of $P'$ to $P$ is the cube of the ratio of the height of $P'$ to $P$.\nThus, the height of $P$ is $\\sqrt [3]{8} = 2$ times the height of $P'$, and thus the height of each is $12$.\nThus, the top of the frustum is a rectangle $A'B'C'D'$ with $A'B' = 6$ and $B'C' = 8$.\nNow, consider the plane that contains diagonal $AC$ as well as the altitude of $P$. Taking the cross section of the frustum along this plane gives the trapezoid $ACC'A'$, inscribed in an equatorial circular section of the sphere. It suffices to consider this circle.\nFirst, we want the length of $AC$. This is given by the Pythagorean Theorem over triangle $ABC$ to be $20$. Thus, $A'C' = 10$. Since the height of this trapezoid is $12$, and $AC$ extends a distance of $5$ on either direction of $A'C'$, we can use a 5-12-13 triangle to determine that $AA' = CC' = 13$.\nNow, we wish to find a point equidistant from $A$, $A'$, and $C$. By symmetry, this point, namely $X$, must lie on the perpendicular bisector of $AC$. Let $X$ be $h$ units from $A'C'$ in $ACC'A'$. By the Pythagorean Theorem twice,\\begin{align*} 5^2 + h^2 & = r^2 \\\\ 10^2 + (12 - h)^2 & = r^2 \\end{align*}Subtracting gives $75 + 144 - 24h = 0 \\Longrightarrow h = \\frac {73}{8}$. Thus $XT = h + 12 = \\frac {169}{8}$ and $m + n = \\boxed{177}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid with a square base has total surface area 432 square units.  The area of each triangular face is half the area of the square face. What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $ABCD$ be the base of the pyramid and let $P$ be the pyramid's apex.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport three;\n\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\n\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\n\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\n\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\n\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\n\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\n\ndraw(P--C);\n\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\n\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\n\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\n\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\n\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\n\ndraw(P--F--M,dashed);\n\ndraw(P--M);\n\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\n\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,SW);\n\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base and $M$ be the midpoint of an edge of the square, as shown.  There are four triangular faces, each with area half the area of the square face.  So, the total surface area of the pyramid is 3 times the area of the square face.  Therefore, the area of the square face is $432/3=144$ square units, which means that each side of the square has length 12.\n\nSince the area of the triangle is half the area of the square, we have $(BC)(PM)/2 = 72$, so $(BC)(PM) = 144$, which means $PM = 144/12 = 12$.  Since $F$ is the center of the square base, we have $FM = 6$, so $PF = \\sqrt{12^2 - 6^2} = 6\\sqrt{3}$.  Finally, the volume of the pyramid is \\[\\frac{[ABCD]\\cdot PF}{3} = \\frac{144\\cdot 6\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\boxed{288\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base with perimeter 24 inches. Its apex is 9 inches from each of the other vertices. What is the height of the pyramid from its peak to the center of its square base, in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\ndraw(P--C);\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\ndraw(P--F--B,dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base.  Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFB$ is a right triangle.  The perimeter of the base of the pyramid is 24 inches, so the length of each side of the base is $6$ inches.  Since $F$ is the center of the base, $FB$ is half the diagonal of the base, or $(6\\sqrt{2})/2 = 3\\sqrt{2}$ inches.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $PFB$ gives  \\[PF = \\sqrt{PB^2 - FB^2} = \\sqrt{81 - 18} = \\sqrt{63} = \\boxed{3\\sqrt{7}} \\text{ inches}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Suppose $PABCD$ is a right square pyramid with apex $P$ and base $ABCD$.  If $PBD$ is an equilateral triangle with side length 6, then what is the volume of $PABCD$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
