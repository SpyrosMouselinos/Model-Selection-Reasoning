    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Six boys stood equally spaced on a circle of radius 40 feet. Each boy walked to all of the other non-adjacent persons on the circle, shook their hands and then returned to his original spot on the circle before the next boy started his trip to shake hands with all of the other non-adjacent boys on the circle. After all six boys had done this, what is the least distance in feet that could have been traveled? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The thicker solid line in the diagram shows the shortest path that one person could travel. The circle is equally divided into six 60-degree arcs, so the short distance is 40 feet, the same as a radius. The dotted line is a diameter that separates the quadrilateral into two 30-60-90 triangles. The longer leg is $(80\\sqrt {3})/2$, or $40\\sqrt{3}$ feet. Each person travels $40\\sqrt{3} + 40 + 40 + 40\\sqrt{3} = 80 + 80\\sqrt{3}$ feet. After all six people did this, $6(80 + 80\\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{480 + 480\\sqrt{3}\\text{ feet}}$ had been traveled.

Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the middle of a vast prairie, a firetruck is stationed at the intersection of two perpendicular straight highways. The truck travels at $50$ miles per hour along the highways and at $14$ miles per hour across the prairie. Consider the set of points that can be reached by the firetruck within six minutes. The area of this region is $m/n$ square miles, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the intersection of the highways be at the origin $O$, and let the highways be the x and y axes. We consider the case where the truck moves in the positive x direction.\nAfter going $x$ miles, $t=\\frac{d}{r}=\\frac{x}{50}$ hours has passed. If the truck leaves the highway it can travel for at most $t=\\frac{1}{10}-\\frac{x}{50}$ hours, or $d=rt=14t=1.4-\\frac{7x}{25}$ miles. It can end up anywhere off the highway in a circle with this radius centered at $(x,0)$. All these circles are homothetic with respect to a center at $(5,0)$.\n[asy] pair truck(pair P){  pair Q = IP(P--P+(7/10,24/10),(35/31,35/31)--(5,0));   D(P--Q,EndArrow(5)); D(CP(P,Q),linewidth(0.5));  return Q; } pointpen = black; pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); size(250); pair B=(5,0), C=(35/31,35/31); D(D(B)--D(C)--D(B*dir(90))--D(C*dir(90))--D(B*dir(180))--D(C*dir(180))--D(B*dir(270))--D(C*dir(270))--cycle); D((-6,0)--(6,0),Arrows(4)); D((0,-6)--(0,6),Arrows(4)); truck((1,0)); truck((2,0)); truck((3,0)); truck((4,0));  [/asy]     [asy]  pointpen = black; pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); size(250); pair O=(0,0), B=(5,0), A=1.4*expi(atan(24/7)), C=1.4*expi(atan(7/24)); D(D(B)--D(A)--D(O)); D(O--D(C)--D(B*dir(90))--D(A*dir(90))--O--D(C*dir(90))--D(B*dir(180))--D(A*dir(180))--O--D(C*dir(180))--D(B*dir(270))--D(A*dir(270))--O--D(C*dir(270))--B,linewidth(0.5)); D(CR(O,1.4));  D((-6,0)--(6,0),Arrows(4)); D((0,-6)--(0,6),Arrows(4)); MP(\"A\",A,N); MP(\"B\",B); MP(\"(5,0)\",B,N); D(MP(\"\\left(\\frac{35}{31},\\frac{35}{31}\\right)\",(35/31,35/31),NE)); D(rightanglemark(O,A,B)); [/asy]\nNow consider the circle at $(0,0)$. Draw a line tangent to it at $A$ and passing through $B (5,0)$. By the Pythagorean Theorem $AB^2+AO^2=OB^2 \\Longrightarrow AB=\\sqrt{OB^2-AO^2}=\\sqrt{5^2-1.4^2}=\\frac{24}{5}$. Then $\\tan(\\angle ABO)=\\frac{OA}{AB}=\\frac{7}{24}$, so the slope of line $AB$ is $\\frac{-7}{24}$. Since it passes through $(5,0)$ its equation is $y=\\frac{-7}{24}(x-5)$.\nThis line and the x and y axis bound the region the truck can go if it moves in the positive x direction. Similarly, the line $y=5-\\frac{24}{7}x$ bounds the region the truck can go if it moves in positive y direction. The intersection of these two lines is $\\left(\\frac{35}{31},\\frac{35}{31}\\right)$. The bounded region in Quadrant I is made up of a square and two triangles. $A=x^2+x(5-x)=5x$. By symmetry, the regions in the other quadrants are the same, so the area of the whole region is $20x=\\frac{700}{31}$ so the answer is $700+31=\\boxed{731}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A street has parallel curbs 40 feet apart. A crosswalk bounded by two parallel stripes crosses the street at an angle. The length of the curb between the stripes is 15 feet and each stripe is 50 feet long. Find the distance, in feet, between the stripes.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The crosswalk is in the shape of a parallelogram with base 15 feet and altitude 40 feet, so its area is $15 \\times 40 = 600\\; \\text{ft}^2$. But viewed another way, the parallelogram has base 50 feet and altitude equal to the distance between the stripes, so this distance must be $600/50=\\boxed{12}$ feet.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(10,0));\ndraw((0,7)--(10,7));\ndraw((0.5,0)--(0.5,7),Arrows);\nlabel(\"40\",(0.5,3.5),W);\nfill((3,0)--(6,0)--(8,7)--(5,7)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nlabel(\"15\",(4.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"15\",(6.5,7),N);\nlabel(\"50\",(4,3.5),W);\nlabel(\"50\",(7,3.5),E);\ndraw((3,0)--(6,0)--(8,7)--(5,7)--cycle);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle with center $O$ has radius 25. Chord $\\overline{AB}$ of length 30 and chord $\\overline{CD}$ of length 14 intersect at point $P$. The distance between the midpoints of the two chords is 12. The quantity $OP^2$ can be represented as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $m + n$ is divided by 1000.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $E$ and $F$ be the midpoints of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, respectively, such that $\\overline{BE}$ intersects $\\overline{CF}$.\nSince $E$ and $F$ are midpoints, $BE = 15$ and $CF = 7$.\n$B$ and $C$ are located on the circumference of the circle, so $OB = OC = 25$.\nThe line through the midpoint of a chord of a circle and the center of that circle is perpendicular to that chord, so $\\triangle OEB$ and $\\triangle OFC$ are right triangles (with $\\angle OEB$ and $\\angle OFC$ being the right angles). By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OE = \\sqrt{25^2 - 15^2} = 20$, and $OF = \\sqrt{25^2 - 7^2} = 24$.\nLet $x$, $a$, and $b$ be lengths $OP$, $EP$, and $FP$, respectively. OEP and OFP are also right triangles, so $x^2 = a^2 + 20^2 \\to a^2 = x^2 - 400$, and $x^2 = b^2 + 24^2 \\to b^2 = x^2 - 576$\nWe are given that $EF$ has length 12, so, using the Law of Cosines with $\\triangle EPF$:\n$12^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos (\\angle EPF) = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos (\\angle EPO + \\angle FPO)$\nSubstituting for $a$ and $b$, and applying the Cosine of Sum formula:\n$144 = (x^2 - 400) + (x^2 - 576) - 2 \\sqrt{x^2 - 400} \\sqrt{x^2 - 576} \\left( \\cos \\angle EPO \\cos \\angle FPO - \\sin \\angle EPO \\sin \\angle FPO \\right)$\n$\\angle EPO$ and $\\angle FPO$ are acute angles in right triangles, so substitute opposite/hypotenuse for sines and adjacent/hypotenuse for cosines:\n$144 = 2x^2 - 976 - 2 \\sqrt{(x^2 - 400)(x^2 - 576)} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 400}}{x} \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 576}}{x} - \\frac{20}{x} \\frac{24}{x} \\right)$\nCombine terms and multiply both sides by $x^2$: $144 x^2 = 2 x^4 - 976 x^2 - 2 (x^2 - 400) (x^2 - 576) + 960  \\sqrt{(x^2 - 400)(x^2 - 576)}$\nCombine terms again, and divide both sides by 64: $13 x^2 = 7200 - 15 \\sqrt{x^4 - 976 x^2 + 230400}$\nSquare both sides: $169 x^4 - 187000 x^2 + 51,840,000 = 225 x^4 - 219600 x^2 + 51,840,000$\nThis reduces to $x^2 = \\frac{4050}{7} = (OP)^2$; $4050 + 7 \\equiv \\boxed{57} \\pmod{1000}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles triangle has side lengths 8 cm, 8 cm and 10 cm.  The longest side of a similar triangle is 25 cm. What is the perimeter of the larger triangle, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the length of the longest sides of the small triangle to the large triangle is $10/25 = 2/5$, which must hold constant for all sides of the two triangles since they are similar.  Thus the perimeters of the two triangles are also in the ratio of $2/5$.  The small triangle has perimeter $8+8+10=26$, so the large triangle has perimeter $\\frac{5}{2}\\cdot 26 = \\boxed{65}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A park is in the shape of a regular hexagon $2$ km on a side. Starting at a corner, Alice walks along the perimeter of the park for a distance of $5$ km. How many kilometers is she from her starting point?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\sqrt{13}\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{14}\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ \\sqrt{15}\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\sqrt{16}\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\sqrt{17}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We imagine this problem on a coordinate plane and let Alice's starting position be the origin. We see that she will travel along two edges and then go halfway along a third. Therefore, her new $x$-coordinate will be $1 + 2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$ because she travels along a distance of $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1$ km because of the side relationships of an equilateral triangle, then $2$ km because the line is parallel to the $x$-axis, and the remaining distance is $\\frac{1}{2}$ km because she went halfway along and because of the logic for the first part of her route. For her $y$-coordinate, we can use similar logic to find that the coordinate is $\\sqrt{3} + 0 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} =  \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, her distance is\\[\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{49}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{52}{4}} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be circles defined by $$\n(x-10)^2+y^2=36\n$$and $$\n(x+15)^2+y^2=81,\n$$respectively. What is the length of the shortest line segment $\\overline{PQ}$ that is tangent to $C_1$ at $P$ and to $C_2$ at $Q$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The centers are at $A=(10,0)$ and $B=(-15,0)$, and the radii are 6 and 9, respectively. Since the internal tangent is shorter than the external tangent, $\\overline{PQ}$ intersects  $\\overline{AB}$ at a point $D$ that divides  $\\overline{AB}$ into parts proportional to the radii. The right triangles $\\triangle APD$ and $\\triangle BQD$ are similar with ratio of similarity $2:3$. Therefore, $D=(0,0), \\, PD=8,$ and $QD=12$. Thus $PQ=\\boxed{20}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.23cm);\npair Q,P,D;\nQ=(-9.6,7.2);\nP=(6.4,-4.8);\nD=(0,0);\ndraw(Q--P);\ndraw(Circle((-15,0),9));\ndraw(Circle((10,0),6));\ndraw((-15,0)--Q--P--(10,0));\ndraw((-25,0)--(17,0));\nlabel(\"$Q$\",Q,NE);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(-15,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$(-15,0)$\",(-15,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$(10,0)$\",(10,0),NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(10,0),NW);\nlabel(\"9\",(-12.1,3.6),NW);\nlabel(\"6\",(8,-2.4),SE);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right triangle with legs $10$ and $8$ is similar to another right triangle with corresponding legs $x$ and $5$, respectively. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By similarity, we know that $\\frac{10}{x} = \\frac{8}{5}$, so therefore $x = \\frac{50}{8} = \\boxed{6.25}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two noncongruent integer-sided isosceles triangles have the same perimeter and the same area. The ratio of the lengths of the bases of the two triangles is $8: 7$. Find the minimum possible value of their common perimeter.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the first triangle have side lengths $a$, $a$, $14c$, and the second triangle have side lengths $b$, $b$, $16c$, where $a, b, 2c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nEqual perimeter:\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} 2a+14c&=&2b+16c\\\\ a+7c&=&b+8c\\\\ c&=&a-b\\\\ \\end{array}$\nEqual Area:\n$\\begin{array}{cccl} 7c(\\sqrt{a^2-(7c)^2})&=&8c(\\sqrt{b^2-(8c)^2})&{}\\\\ 7(\\sqrt{(a+7c)(a-7c)})&=&8(\\sqrt{(b+8c)(b-8c)})&{}\\\\ 7(\\sqrt{(a-7c)})&=&8(\\sqrt{(b-8c)})&\\text{(Note that } a+7c=b+8c)\\\\ 49a-343c&=&64b-512c&{}\\\\ 49a+169c&=&64b&{}\\\\ 49a+169(a-b)&=&64b&\\text{(Note that } c=a-b)\\\\ 218a&=&233b&{}\\\\ \\end{array}$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integer, the minimum occurs when $a=233$, $b=218$, and $c=15$. Hence, the perimeter is $2a+14c=2(233)+14(15)=\\boxed{676}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle of radius $r$ has chords $\\overline{AB}$ of length $10$ and $\\overline{CD}$ of length 7. When $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are extended through $B$ and $C$, respectively, they intersect at $P$, which is outside of the circle. If $\\angle{APD}=60^\\circ$ and $BP=8$, then $r^2=$\n$\\text{(A) } 70\\quad \\text{(B) } 71\\quad \\text{(C) } 72\\quad \\text{(D) } 73\\quad \\text{(E) } 74$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]  import olympiad;  import cse5; import geometry; size(150); defaultpen(fontsize(10pt)); defaultpen(0.8); dotfactor = 4; path circ = Circle(origin, 1); pair A = dir(degrees(7pi/12)); pair D = dir(degrees(-5pi/12)); pair B = dir(degrees(2pi/12)); pair C = dir(degrees(-2pi/12)); pair P = extension(A, B, C, D); draw(circ); draw(A--P--D); label('$A$', A, N); label('$D$', D, S); label('$C$', C, SE); label('$B$', B, NE); label('$P$', P, E); label('$60^\\circ$', P, 2 * (dir(P--A) + dir(P--D))); label('$10$', A--B, S); label('$8$', B--P, NE); label('$7$', C--D, N);  [/asy]\nApplying Power of a Point on $P$, we find that $PC=9$ and thus $PD=16$. Observing that $PD=2BP$ and that $\\angle BPD=60^{\\circ}$, we conclude that $BPD$ is a $30-60-90$ right triangle with right angle at $B$. Thus, $BD=8\\sqrt{3}$ and triangle $ABD$ is also right. Using that fact that the circumcircle of a right triangle has its diameter equal to the hypotenuse, we compute using the Pythagorean Theorem $AD=2r=2\\sqrt{73}$. From here we see that $r^2=\\boxed{73}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport is 8 miles southwest of downtown St. Paul and 10 miles southeast of downtown Minneapolis.
