    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the total volume in cubic feet of three boxes if each box is a cube with edge length 4 feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each box has volume $4^3=64$ cubic feet. Thus, three boxes have volume $64\\cdot3=\\boxed{192}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume, in cubic inches, of a rectangular box, whose faces have areas of $24$ square inches, $16$ square inches and $6$ square inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular box, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=24$, $wh=16$, and $lh=6$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=24\\cdot16\\cdot6=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot2^4\\cdot2\\cdot3=2^8\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^4\\cdot3=\\boxed{48}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Lisa, a child with strange requirements for her projects, is making a rectangular cardboard box with square bases. She wants the height of the box to be 3 units greater than the side of the square bases. What should the height be if she wants the surface area of the box to be at least 90 square units while using the least amount of cardboard?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We let the side length of the base of the box be $x$, so the height of the box is $x+3$. The surface area of each box then is $2x^2 + 4(x)(x+3)$.  Therefore, we must have $$2x^2+4x(x+3) \\ge 90.$$Expanding the product on the left and rearranging gives $ 2x^2+4x^2+12x-90 \\ge 0$, so $6x^2+12x-90 \\ge 0$.  Dividing by 6 gives  $x^2+2x-15 \\ge 0$, so  $(x+5)(x-3) \\ge 0$.  Therefore, we have $x \\le -5 \\text{ or } x\\ge 3$. Since the dimensions of the box can't be negative, the least possible length of the side of the base is $3$. This makes the height of the box $3+3=\\boxed{6}$.\n\nNote that we also could have solved this problem with trial-and-error.  The surface area increases as the side length of the base of the box increases.  If we let this side length be 1, then the surface area is $2\\cdot 1^2 + 4(1)(4) = 18$.  If we let it be 2, then the surface area is $2\\cdot 2^2 + 4(2)(5) = 8 + 40 = 48$.  If we let it be 3, then the surface area is $2\\cdot 3^2 + 4(3)(6) = 18+72 = 90$.  So, the smallest the base side length can be is 3, which means the smallest the height can be is $\\boxed{6}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The sum of the lengths of the twelve edges of a rectangular box is $140$, and the distance from one corner of the box to the farthest corner is $21$. What is the total surface area of the box?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be the dimensions of the box. It is given that \\[140=4a+4b+4c{\\qquad \\rm and\n\\qquad}21=\\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}\\] hence \\[35=a+b+c{\\qquad (1)\\qquad\n\\rm and\\qquad}441=a^2+b^2+c^2{\\qquad (2)}.\\]\n\nSquare both sides of $(1)$ and combine with $(2)$ to obtain \\begin{align*}\n1225 & = (a+b+c)^2 \\\\\n&= a^2+b^2+c^2+2ab+2bc+2ca \\\\\n&= 441+2ab+2bc+2ca.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThus the surface area of the box is \\[ 2ab+2bc+2ca=1225-441=\\boxed{784}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangular prism has dimensions 8 inches by 2 inches by 32 inches. If a cube has the same volume as the prism, what is the surface area of the cube, in square inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cube has volume $8\\cdot2\\cdot32$ cubic inches, so its edge length is $\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot2\\cdot32}=\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot64}=\\sqrt[3]{8}\\sqrt[3]{64}=2\\cdot4=8$ inches.  The surface area of a cube with edge length 8 inches is $6(8\\text{ in.})^2=\\boxed{384}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangular box has interior dimensions 6-inches by 5-inches by 10-inches. The box is filled with as many solid 3-inch cubes as possible, with all of the cubes entirely inside the rectangular box. What percent of the volume of the box is taken up by the cubes?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Three-inch cubes can fill a rectangular box only if the edge lengths of the box are all integer multiples of 3 inches.  The largest such box whose dimensions are less than or equal to those of the $6''\\times5''\\times10''$ box is a $6''\\times3''\\times9''$ box.  The ratio of the volumes of these two boxes is  \\[\n\\frac{6\\cdot3\\cdot9}{6\\cdot5\\cdot10}=\\frac{3\\cdot9}{5\\cdot10}=\\frac{27}{50},\n\\] which is $\\boxed{54}$ percent.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A solid box is 15 cm by 10 cm by 8 cm. A new solid is formed by removing a cube 3 cm on a side from each corner of this box. What percent of the original volume is removed?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The total volume of the eight removed cubes is $8\\times 3^{3}=216$ cubic centimeters, and the volume of the original box is $15\\times 10\\times 8 = 1200$ cubic centimeters. Therefore the volume has been reduced by $\\left(\\frac{216}{1200}\\right)(100\\%) = \\boxed{18\\%}. $\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has a surface area of 216 square centimeters. What is the volume of the cube, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are 6 faces to a cube, meaning that each face has area 36, and the edge has length 6, for a total volume of $6^3 = \\boxed{216}$ for the cube.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangular box $P$ is inscribed in a sphere of radius $r$. The surface area of $P$ is 384, and the sum of the lengths of its 12 edges is 112. What is  $r$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the dimensions of $P$ be $x$, $y$, and $z$. The sum of the lengths of the edges of $P$ is $4(x+y+z)$, and the surface area of $P$ is $2xy+2yz+2xz$, so \\[\nx+y+z=28 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 2xy+2yz+2xz=384.\n\\] Each internal diagonal of $P$ is a diameter of the sphere, so \\begin{align*}\n(2r)^2&=(x^2+y^2+z^2)\\\\\n&=(x+y+z)^2-(2xy+2xz+2yz) \\\\\n&= 28^2-384\\\\& = 400.\n\\end{align*} So $2r = 20$ and  $r=\\boxed{10}$.\n\nNote: There are infinitely many positive solutions of the system $x+y+z=28$, $2xy+2yz+2xz=384$, so there are infinitely many non-congruent boxes meeting the given conditions, but each can be inscribed in a sphere of radius 10.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume, in cubic units, of a cube whose surface area is 600 square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The surface area of a cube equals 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces). If the cube has a sidelength of $s$, then the surface area equals $6s^2$. We set that equal to 600 and solve for $s$, which must be positive. $$600=6s^2\\qquad\\Rightarrow 100=s^2\\qquad\\Rightarrow 10=s$$ The volume of the cube is $s^3=10^3=\\boxed{1000}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A particular cubic box has edge length two inches. If the box has no top, what is the external surface area of the box?\n\nAnswer:\n",
