    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse of an isosceles, right triangle is $10$ units.  What is the length of a leg of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse, so the hypotenuse is $10\\cdot2=20$ units long. Since the right triangle is isosceles, the length of a leg is $20/\\sqrt{2}=\\boxed{10\\sqrt{2}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ such that $AB = AC = 8$ and $BC = 10.$ What is the length of the median $AM$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let's draw a sketch first. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, we know that $AM$ must form a right angle with $BC.$ [asy]\npair A, B, C, M;\nA = (0, 6.24);\nB = (-5, 0);\nC = (5, 0);\nM = 0.5 * B + 0.5 * C;\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--M);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,M,B,10));\n[/asy] We know that $BM = MC = \\frac{BC}{2} = 5.$ Now we just simply apply the Pythagorean Theorem on the right triangle $\\triangle ABM.$ \\begin{align*}\nAM^2 &= AB^2 - BM^2\\\\\nAM^2 &= 8^2 - 5^2 = 39\\\\\nAM &= \\boxed{\\sqrt{39}}\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with legs $AB$ and $AC$. Points $X$ and $Y$ lie on legs $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, so that $AX:XB = AY:YC = 1:2$. If $BY = 16$ units, and $CX = 28$ units, what is the length of hypotenuse $BC$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $AB = x$ and $AC = y$. Then we can write two Pythagorean equations from the information given: $(x/3)^2 + y^2 = 28^2$ and $x^2 + (y/3)^2 = 16^2$. These equations become $x^2/9 + y^2 = 784$ and $x^2 + y^2/9 = 256$. Multiplying them both by 9, we get $x^2 + 9y^2= 7056$ and $9x^2 + y^2\n= 2304$. Now we add the two equations to get $10x^2 + 10y^2 = 9360$, which can be reduced to $x^2\n+ y^2 = 936$. We do not need to solve for $x$ and $y$ since 936 is the square of the hypotenuse $BC$. The length is thus $\\sqrt{936} = \\sqrt{(36 \\times 26)} = \\sqrt{36} \\times \\sqrt{26} = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{26}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 7$, $AC = 15$, and the length of median $AM$ is 10.  Find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Extend $AM$ to $D$ so that $MD = MA$.  Then triangles $AMB$ and $DMC$ are congruent, so triangles $ABC$ and $ACD$ have equal area.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, M;\n\nA = (-7/sqrt(37),42/sqrt(37));\nB = (0,0);\nC = (2*sqrt(37),0);\nM = (B + C)/2;\nD = 2*M - A;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D--C);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$7$\", (A + B)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$15$\", (A + C)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (A + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (D + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$7$\", (C + D)/2, E);\n[/asy]\n\nThe semi-perimeter of triangle $ACD$ is $(7 + 15 + 20)/2 = 21$, so by Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ACD$ is $$\\sqrt{21 (21 - 7)(21 - 15)(21 - 20)} = \\boxed{42}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 5$, $BC = 8$, and the length of median $AM$ is 4.  Find $AC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $BC = 8$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $BM = CM = 4$.  But $AM = 4$, so $M$ is the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$.  Furthermore, $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, so $\\angle BAC = 90^\\circ$.\n\n[asy]\n\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, M;\n\nA = dir(110);\n\nB = (-1,0);\n\nC = (1,0);\n\nM = (0,0);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\n\ndraw(A--M);\n\ndraw(Circle(M,1));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\n\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\n\ndot(\"$M$\", M, S);\n\n[/asy]\n\nThen by Pythagoras on right triangle $ABC$, $AC = \\sqrt{BC^2 - AB^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 - 5^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 25} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{39}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The longer leg of a right triangle is $1$ foot shorter than twice the length of the shorter leg. The area of the triangle is $60$ square feet. What is the length of the hypotenuse, in feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $x$ represents the length of the shorter leg, then the two legs are $x$ and $2x-1$. In a right triangle, the length of one leg is the base and the length of the other leg is the height, so the area of this triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}bh=\\frac{1}{2}x(2x-1)$. We set this equal to 60 and solve for $x$. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}(2x^2-x)&=60\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2x^2-x&=120\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n2x^2-x-120&=0\\quad\\Rightarrow\\\\\n(2x+15)(x-8)&=0\n\\end{align*} Since $x$ must be positive, we get that $x=8$. The shorter leg is 8 feet long and the longer leg is $2(8)-1=15$ feet long. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse or we recognize that 8 and 15 are part of the Pythagorean triple $8:15:17$. The hypotenuse of the right triangle is $\\boxed{17}$ feet long.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n One leg of a right triangle is 12 inches, and the measure of the angle opposite that leg is $30^\\circ$. What is the number of inches in the hypotenuse of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A right triangle with a $30^\\circ$ angle is a 30-60-90 triangle.  In such a triangle, the hypotenuse has twice the length of the leg opposite the $30^\\circ$ angle, so the hypotenuse of the triangle in the problem has length $2\\cdot 12 = \\boxed{24}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $BC = 8$.  The length of median $AD$ is 5.  Let $M$ be the largest possible value of $AB^2 + AC^2$, and let $m$ be the smallest possible value.  Find $M - m$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $AD$ is a median, $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, so $BD = CD = 4$.  Let $P$ be the projection of $A$ onto $BC$.  (Without loss of generality, we may assume that $P$ lies on $BD$.)  Let $x = BP$, so $PD = 4 - x$.  Let $h = AP$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.4 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, P;\n\nA = (4,12);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (14,0);\nD = (B + C)/2;\nP = (A + reflect(B,C)*(A))/2;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(A--P);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, SE);\nlabel(\"$P$\", P, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$x$\", (B + P)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$4 - x$\", (P + D)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$4$\", (D + C)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$5$\", (A + D)/2, E);\nlabel(\"$h$\", (A + P)/2, W);\n[/asy]\n\nThen by Pythagoras on right triangles $APB$, $APC$, and $APD$, \\begin{align*}\nAB^2 &= x^2 + h^2, \\\\\nAC^2 &= (8 - x)^2 + h^2, \\\\\n25 &= (4 - x)^2 + h^2.\n\\end{align*}Adding the first two equations, we get \\[AB^2 + AC^2 = x^2 + h^2 + (8 - x)^2 + h^2 = 2x^2 - 16x + 64 + 2h^2.\\]But from the third equation, $25 = x^2 - 8x + 16 + h^2$, so \\begin{align*}\nAB^2 + AC^2 &= 2x^2 - 16x + 64 + 2h^2 \\\\\n&= 2(x^2 - 8x + 16 + h^2) + 32 \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 25 + 32 \\\\\n&= 82.\n\\end{align*}Hence, from the given data, $AB^2 + AC^2$ can only take on the value 82.  Therefore, $M = m = 82$, so $M - m = \\boxed{0}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two similar right triangles have areas of 6 square inches and 150 square inches. The length of the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches. What is the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the smaller triangle has hypotenuse 5, we guess that it is a 3-4-5 triangle.  Sure enough, the area of a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4 is $(3)(4)/2 = 6$, so this works.  The area of the larger triangle is $150/6=25$ times the area of the smaller triangle, so its side lengths are $\\sqrt{25} = 5$ times as long as the side lengths of the smaller triangle.  Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle is $5(3+4) = \\boxed{35}$.\n\nProof that the only possibility for the smaller triangle is that it is a 3-4-5 triangle: Let's call the legs of the smaller triangle $a$ and $b$ (with $b$ being the longer leg) and the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle $c$. Similarly, let's call the corresponding legs of the larger triangle $A$ and $B$ and the hypotenuse of the larger triangle $C$. Since the area of the smaller triangle is 6 square inches, we can say  $$\\frac{1}{2}ab=6.$$ Additionally, we are told that the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches, so $c=5$ and $$a^2+b^2=25.$$ Because $\\frac{1}{2}ab=6$, we get $ab=12$ or $a=\\frac{12}{b}$. We can now write the equation in terms of $b$. We get \\begin{align*}\na^2+b^2&=25\\\\\n\\left(\\frac{12}{b}\\right)^{2}+b^2&=25\\\\\n12^2+b^4&=25b^2\\\\\nb^4-25b^2+144&=0.\n\\end{align*} Solving for $b$, we get  $$b^4-25b^2+144=(b-4)(b+4)(b-3)(b+3)=0.$$ Since we said that $b$ is the longer of the two legs, $b=4$ and $a=3$. Therefore, the triangle must be a 3-4-5 right triangle.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $ABC$, $AB=10$, $AC=6$ and $BC=8$ units.  What is the distance from $C$ to the midpoint of segment $AB$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse.  Therefore, the desired distance is $10/2 = \\boxed{5}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right triangle has leg lengths of 8 and 15 units. What is the length, in units, of the median to the hypotenuse? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\nAnswer:\n",
