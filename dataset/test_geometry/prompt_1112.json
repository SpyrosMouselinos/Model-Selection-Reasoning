    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular polygon has exterior angles each measuring 15 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The measure of each exterior angle in a regular $n$-gon is $360/n$ degrees.  Setting this expression equal to 15, we find $n=\\boxed{24}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular polygon has an exterior angle that measures $15$ degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$ as long as we take only one exterior angle per vertex. The polygon is regular, so all of the exterior angles have the same degree measure of $15$ degrees. If the polygon has $n$ sides, then the sum of the exterior angles is $15n=360$. So $n=24$ and the polygon has $\\boxed{24}$ sides.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The degree measures of the angles in a convex 18-sided polygon form an increasing arithmetic sequence with integer values. Find the degree measure of the smallest angle.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The average angle in an 18-gon is $160^\\circ$. In an arithmetic sequence the average is the same as the median, so the middle two terms of the sequence average to $160^\\circ$. Thus for some positive (the sequence is increasing and thus non-constant) integer $d$, the middle two terms are $(160-d)^\\circ$ and $(160+d)^\\circ$. Since the step is $2d$ the last term of the sequence is $(160 + 17d)^\\circ$, which must be less than $180^\\circ$, since the polygon is convex. This gives $17d < 20$, so the only suitable positive integer $d$ is 1. The first term is then $(160-17)^\\circ = \\boxed{143}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measure of each exterior angle of a regular polygon is $30$ degrees. What is the sum of the measures of the interior angles, in degrees?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Taking one exterior angle per vertex, the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$. If each exterior angle is $30^\\circ$, then the polygon has $\\frac{360}{30}=12$ sides. The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$, so for a polygon with 12 sides, the sum of the interior angles is $180(12-2)=\\boxed{1800}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The point $O$ is the center of the circle circumscribed about $\\triangle ABC$, with $\\angle BOC = 120^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle AOB =\n140^{\\circ}$, as shown. What is the degree measure of $\\angle\nABC$?\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C;\ndraw(Circle((0,0),20),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),S);\nA=(-16,-12);\nC=(16,-12);\nB=(3,19.7);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$140^{\\circ}$\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"$120^{\\circ}$\",(0,0.3),E);\ndraw(C--(0,0)--B);\ndraw(A--(0,0));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $OA=OB=OC$, triangles $AOB$, $BOC$, and $COA$ are all isosceles. Hence \\[\n\\angle ABC = \\angle ABO + \\angle OBC =\n\\frac{180^{\\circ}-140^{\\circ}}{2}+\n\\frac{180^{\\circ}-120^{\\circ}}{2}=\\boxed{50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]OR\n\n\nSince \\[\n\\angle AOC = 360^{\\circ}-140^{\\circ}-120^{\\circ}=100^{\\circ},\n\\]the Central Angle Theorem implies that \\[\n\\angle ABC = \\frac{1}{2}\\angle AOC = \\boxed{50^{\\circ}}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Polygon $ABCDEF$ is a regular hexagon. What is the measure in degrees of angle $ABF$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In triangle $ABF$, the two acute angles are equal since $AB=AF$. Also, the measure of $\\angle A$ is $180^\\circ(6-2)/6=120^\\circ$.  Letting $x$ be the measure of $\\angle ABF$, we have \\[\n120^\\circ+x+x=180^\\circ \\implies x=\\boxed{30}\\text{ degrees}.\n\\] [asy]\nsize(5cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nint i;\npair A=dir(0), B=dir(60), C=dir(120), D=dir(180), Ep=dir(240), F=dir(300);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D,Ep,F};\nstring[] alphabet={\"$A$\",\"$B$\",\"$C$\",\"$D$\",\"$E$\",\"$F$\"};\ndot(dots);\nfor(i=0;i<6;++i)\n{\n\ndraw(dir(60*i)--dir(60*i+60));\n\nlabel(alphabet[i],dots[i],dots[i]);\n}\ndraw(A--B--F);\ndraw(anglemark(F,B,A));\ndraw(anglemark(A,F,B));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $n$ equal the number of sides in a regular polygon. For $3\\leq n < 10$, how many values of $n$ result in a regular polygon where the common degree measure of the interior angles is not an integer?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The number of degrees is the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$.  If the $n$-gon is regular, then each angle measures $\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$ degrees.  If $n=3$, 4, 5, 6, or 9, then $n$ divides evenly into 180, so the number of degrees in each angle is an integer.  If $n=7$, then the number of degrees is $180\\cdot5/7=900/7$, which is not an integer.  If $n=8$, the number of degrees in each angle is $180\\cdot 6/8=135$.  Therefore, only $\\boxed{1}$ value of $n$ between 3 and 9 results in a non-integer degree measure for each interior angle of a regular $n$-gon.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In regular pentagon $ABCDE$, diagonal $AC$ is drawn, as shown. Given that each interior angle of a regular pentagon measures 108 degrees, what is the measure of angle $CAB$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(4cm,4cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(1pt)+fontsize(10pt));\n\npair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (0,0);\nB = dir(108);\nC = B+dir(39);\nD = C+dir(-39);\nE = (1,0);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw(A--C,linewidth(1)+linetype(\"0 4\"));\n\nlabel(\"A\",A,S);\nlabel(\"B\",B,W);\nlabel(\"C\",C,N);\nlabel(\"D\",D,E);\nlabel(\"E\",E,S);\nlabel(\"$108^\\circ$\",B,E);;\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $ABCDE$ is a regular pentagon, we know by symmetry that the measures of $\\angle CAB$ and $\\angle BCA$ are equal. We also know that the sum of the measures of the angles of $\\triangle ABC$ equals $180$ degrees. Thus, if we let $x = $ the measure of $\\angle CAB$ = the measure of $\\angle BCA$, we have that $180 = 108 + x + x \\Rightarrow 2x = 72 \\Rightarrow x = 36$. The measure of angle $CAB$ is $\\boxed{36}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The figure shows a square in the interior of a regular hexagon.  The square and regular hexagon share a common side. What is the degree measure of $\\angle ABC$? [asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;\nA=(0,.866);\nB=(.5,1.732);\nC=(1.5,1.732);\nD=(2,.866);\nE=(1.5,0);\nF=(.5,0);\nG=(.5,1);\nH=(1.5,1);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--E);\ndraw(E--F);\ndraw(F--A);\ndraw(F--G);\ndraw(G--H);\ndraw(H--E);\ndraw(D--H);\nlabel(\"A\", C, N);\nlabel(\"B\", D, E);\nlabel(\"C\", H, N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label the lower right corner of the square point $D$ and the lower left corner $E$. The interior angles of a regular hexagon are 120 degrees and the interior angles of a square are 90 degrees. Thus, $m\\angle BDC=m \\angle BDE - m\\angle CDE=120^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 30^\\circ$. In addition, because the square and regular hexagon share a side and all of their sides have the same length, segments $CD$ and $BD$ have the same length. Thus, triangle $BCD$ is isosceles.\n\nBecause the base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent, $m\\angle BCD = m \\angle CBD=x$. In addition, because the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have  \\begin{align*}\n180^\\circ &= m\\angle BDC+m\\angle BCD + m\\angle CBD \\\\\n&=30^\\circ + x + x \\\\\n150^\\circ &= 2x \\\\\n75^\\circ = x\n\\end{align*} Thus, $m\\angle CBD=75^\\circ$. Finally, we calculate $m\\angle ABC=m\\angle ABD- m\\angle CBD=120^\\circ-75^\\circ=\\boxed{45}^\\circ$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AX = XY = YB = BC$ and the measure of angle $ABC$ is 120 degrees. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$?\n\n[asy]\npair A,X,Y,B,C;\nX = A + dir(30); Y = X + dir(0); B = Y + dir(60); C = B + dir(-30);\ndraw(B--Y--X--B--C--A--X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$X$\",X,NW); label(\"$Y$\",Y,S); label(\"$B$\",B,N); label(\"$C$\",C,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $t$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$ (which is what we want to compute).\n\nSince $AX=XY$, we have $\\angle AYX = \\angle YAX = \\angle BAC = t^\\circ$. Then, since the sum of angles in $\\triangle AXY$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle AXY = (180-2t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AXY$ and $\\angle BXY$ add to form a straight angle, so they are supplementary; $\\angle BXY = (180-(180-2t))^\\circ = (2t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $XY=YB$, we have $\\angle XBY = \\angle BXY = (2t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle XYB$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle XYB = (180-4t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AYX$, $\\angle XYB$, and $\\angle BYC$ add to form a straight angle, so their sum is $180^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle BYC = (180-t-(180-4t))^\\circ = (3t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $YB=BC$, we have $\\angle YCB = \\angle BYC = (3t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle YBC$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle YBC = (180-6t)^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, $\\angle ABC = \\angle XBY + \\angle YBC = (2t)^\\circ + (180-6t)^\\circ = (180-4t)^\\circ$. We know this is equal to $120^\\circ$, so we solve the equation $$180-4t = 120$$ to obtain $t=\\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A star-polygon is drawn on a clock face by drawing a chord from each number to the fifth number counted clockwise from that number.
