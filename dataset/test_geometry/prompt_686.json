    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the smallest possible perimeter, in units, of a triangle whose side-length measures are consecutive integer values?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The smallest such triangle has lengths 1, 2, and 3. However, this triangle doesn't work since the sum of any two side lengths must be greater than the third side length (by the Triangle Inequality). The next smallest triangle has lengths 2, 3, and 4, which works. Thus, the smallest possible perimeter is $2+3+4=\\boxed{9}$ units.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $B$ is on $\\overline{AC}$ with $AB = 9$ and $BC = 21.$ Point $D$ is not on $\\overline{AC}$ so that $AD = CD,$ and $AD$ and $BD$ are integers. Let $s$ be the sum of all possible perimeters of $\\triangle ACD$. Find $s.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] size(220); pointpen = black; pathpen = black + linewidth(0.7); pair O=(0,0),A=(-15,0),B=(-6,0),C=(15,0),D=(0,8); D(D(MP(\"A\",A))--D(MP(\"C\",C))--D(MP(\"D\",D,NE))--cycle); D(D(MP(\"B\",B))--D); D((0,-4)--(0,12),linetype(\"4 4\")+linewidth(0.7)); MP(\"6\",B/2); MP(\"15\",C/2); MP(\"9\",(A+B)/2); [/asy]\nDenote the height of $\\triangle ACD$ as $h$, $x = AD = CD$, and $y = BD$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find that $h^2 = y^2 - 6^2$ and $h^2 = x^2 - 15^2$. Thus, $y^2 - 36 = x^2 - 225 \\Longrightarrow x^2 - y^2 = 189$. The LHS is difference of squares, so $(x + y)(x - y) = 189$. As both $x,\\ y$ are integers, $x+y,\\ x-y$ must be integral divisors of $189$.\nThe pairs of divisors of $189$ are $(1,189)\\ (3,63)\\ (7,27)\\ (9,21)$. This yields the four potential sets for $(x,y)$ as $(95,94)\\ (33,30)\\ (17,10)\\ (15,6)$. The last is not a possibility since it simply degenerates into a line. The sum of the three possible perimeters of $\\triangle ACD$ is equal to $3(AC) + 2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) = 90 + 2(95 + 33 + 17) = \\boxed{380}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many different triangles can be formed having a perimeter of 7 units if each side must have integral length?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $a,b,$ and $c$ represent the three side lengths of the triangle. The perimeter is $a+b+c=7,$ so $b+c=7-a$. We know by the Triangle Inequality that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle must be greater than the third side length. If we focus on the variable $a$, we have\n\\[b+c>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 7-a>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 3.5>a.\\]We could easily replace $a$ with $b$ or $c$, so the maximum length of any of the three sides is $3$. If $a=3$, then $b+c=4$ and $b$ and $c$ could be $1$ and $3$ in some order or $2$ and $2$ in some order. If we let $a=2$ or $a=1$ and the maximum side length is $3$, we'll still end up with triangles of side lengths $(1,3,3)$ or $(2,2,3)$. There are $\\boxed{2}$ different triangles.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the perimeter of pentagon $ABCDE$ in this diagram? [asy]\npair cis(real r,real t) { return (r*cos(t),r*sin(t)); }\npair a=(0,0);\npair b=cis(1,-pi/2);\npair c=cis(sqrt(2),-pi/4);\npair d=cis(sqrt(3),-pi/4+atan(1/sqrt(2)));\npair e=cis(2,-pi/4+atan(1/sqrt(2))+atan(1/sqrt(3)));\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); dot(d); dot(e);\ndraw(a--b--c--d--e--a);\ndraw(a--c); draw(a--d);\ndraw(0.86*b--0.86*b+0.14*(c-b)--b+0.14*(c-b));\ndraw(0.9*c--0.9*c+0.14*(d-c)--c+0.14*(d-c));\ndraw(0.92*d--0.92*d+0.14*(e-d)--d+0.14*(e-d));\nlabel(\"$A$\",a,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",b,SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",c,SSE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",d,ESE);\nlabel(\"$E$\",e,NE);\nlabel(\"1\",(a+b)/2,W);\nlabel(\"1\",(b+c)/2,S);\nlabel(\"1\",(c+d)/2,SE);\nlabel(\"1\",(d+e)/2,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Pythagorean theorem, we have: \\begin{align*}\nAC^2 &= AB^2 + BC^2 = 1+1 = 2; \\\\\nAD^2 &= AC^2 + CD^2 = 2+1 = 3; \\\\\nAE^2 &= AD^2 + DE^2 = 3+1 = 4.\n\\end{align*}Thus $AE=\\sqrt 4=2,$ and the perimeter of pentagon $ABCDE$ is $1+1+1+1+2 = \\boxed{6}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the polygon shown, each side is perpendicular to its adjacent sides, and all 28 of the sides are congruent.  The perimeter of the polygon is 56.  Find the area of the polygon.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\ndraw((3,0)--(4,0)--(4,1)--(5,1)--(5,2)--(6,2)--(6,3)--(7,3)--(7,4)--(6,4)--(6,5)--(5,5)--(5,6)--(4,6)--(4,7)--(3,7)--(3,6)--(2,6)--(2,5)--(1,5)--(1,4)--(0,4)--(0,3)--(1,3)--(1,2)--(2,2)--(2,1)--(3,1)--cycle);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can divide the polygon into 25 squares.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\ndraw((3,0)--(4,0));\ndraw((2,1)--(5,1));\ndraw((1,2)--(6,2));\ndraw((0,3)--(7,3));\ndraw((0,4)--(7,4));\ndraw((1,5)--(6,5));\ndraw((2,6)--(5,6));\ndraw((3,7)--(4,7));\ndraw((0,3)--(0,4));\ndraw((1,2)--(1,5));\ndraw((2,1)--(2,6));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,7));\ndraw((4,0)--(4,7));\ndraw((5,1)--(5,6));\ndraw((6,2)--(6,5));\ndraw((7,3)--(7,4));\n[/asy]\n\nLet the side length of each square be $s$.  Then the perimeter of the polygon is $28s = 56$, so $s = 2$.  Hence, the area of the polygon is $25s^2 = \\boxed{100}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many non-congruent triangles with only integer side lengths have a perimeter of 15 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In a triangle, the lengths of any two sides must add up to a value larger than the third length's side.  This is known as the Triangle Inequality.  Keeping this in mind, we list out cases based on the length of the shortest side.\n\nCase 1:  shortest side has length $1$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $7$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{1,7,7\\}$.\n\nCase 2:  shortest side has length $2$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $6$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{2,6,7\\}$.\n\nCase 3:  shortest side has length $3$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $6$ and $6$ or $5$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{3,6,6\\}$ and $\\{3,5,7\\}$.\n\nCase 4:  shortest side has length $4$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $5$ and $6$ or $4$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{4,5,6\\}$ and $\\{4,4,7\\}$.\n\nCase 5:  shortest side has length $5$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $5$ and $5$.  This leads to the set $\\{5,5,5\\}$.\n\nHence there are $\\boxed{7}$ sets of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of $15$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two noncongruent integer-sided isosceles triangles have the same perimeter and the same area. The ratio of the lengths of the bases of the two triangles is $8: 7$. Find the minimum possible value of their common perimeter.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the first triangle have side lengths $a$, $a$, $14c$, and the second triangle have side lengths $b$, $b$, $16c$, where $a, b, 2c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nEqual perimeter:\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} 2a+14c&=&2b+16c\\\\ a+7c&=&b+8c\\\\ c&=&a-b\\\\ \\end{array}$\nEqual Area:\n$\\begin{array}{cccl} 7c(\\sqrt{a^2-(7c)^2})&=&8c(\\sqrt{b^2-(8c)^2})&{}\\\\ 7(\\sqrt{(a+7c)(a-7c)})&=&8(\\sqrt{(b+8c)(b-8c)})&{}\\\\ 7(\\sqrt{(a-7c)})&=&8(\\sqrt{(b-8c)})&\\text{(Note that } a+7c=b+8c)\\\\ 49a-343c&=&64b-512c&{}\\\\ 49a+169c&=&64b&{}\\\\ 49a+169(a-b)&=&64b&\\text{(Note that } c=a-b)\\\\ 218a&=&233b&{}\\\\ \\end{array}$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integer, the minimum occurs when $a=233$, $b=218$, and $c=15$. Hence, the perimeter is $2a+14c=2(233)+14(15)=\\boxed{676}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A scalene triangle has side lengths which are prime numbers and the  length of its perimeter is also prime. What is its smallest possible  perimeter?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The first few prime numbers are: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,\\ldots$.  Since the triangle is scalene, all the sides are different primes.\n\nIf one side is 2, then the other two sides must be odd.  Then the perimeter of the triangle would be even.  But the perimeter must also be greater than 2, so it cannot be prime.  This means that none of the sides can be 2.\n\nNow, suppose one side is 3.  Let the other two sides be $p$ and $q,$ where $p < q.$  Since all the sides are different,\n\\[3 < p < q.\\]Also, by the Triangle Inequality, $p + 3 > q,$ so\n\\[p > q - 3.\\]Since $p < q,$ the only possible values of $p$ are $q - 2$ and $q - 1.$\n\nSince $p$ is a prime greater than 3, $p$ is odd.  If $p = q - 1,$ then $q = p + 1$ is even, which means $q$ is not prime.  Therefore, $p = q - 2,$ or\n\\[q = p + 2.\\]As a number, $p$ must be of the form $3k,$ $3k + 1,$ or $3k + 2.$  Since $p$ is prime, $p$ cannot be of the form $3k.$  If $p = 3k + 1,$ then $q = p + 2 = 3k + 3 = 3(k + 1),$ which is not prime.  Therefore, $p = 3k + 2.$  Then $q = p + 2 = 3k + 4,$ and the perimeter of the triangle is\n\\[p + q + 3 = (3k + 2) + (3k + 4) + 3 = 6k + 9 = 3(2k + 3).\\]Since this is divisible by 3, the perimeter cannot be prime.  This tells us that none of the sides can be equal to 3 either.\n\nNote that $5 + 7 + 11 = 23$ is prime, so the smallest possible perimeter is $\\boxed{23}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In $\\triangle ABC$, the sides have integer lengths and $AB=AC$. Circle $\\omega$ has its center at the incenter of $\\triangle ABC$. An excircle of $\\triangle ABC$ is a circle in the exterior of $\\triangle ABC$ that is tangent to one side of the triangle and tangent to the extensions of the other two sides. Suppose that the excircle tangent to $\\overline{BC}$ is internally tangent to $\\omega$, and the other two excircles are both externally tangent to $\\omega$. Find the minimum possible value of the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the tangent circle be $\\omega$. Some notation first: let $BC=a$, $AB=b$, $s$ be the semiperimeter, $\\theta=\\angle ABC$, and $r$ be the inradius. Intuition tells us that the radius of $\\omega$ is $r+\\frac{2rs}{s-a}$ (using the exradius formula). However, the sum of the radius of $\\omega$ and $\\frac{rs}{s-b}$ is equivalent to the distance between the incenter and the the $B/C$ excenter. Denote the B excenter as $I_B$ and the incenter as $I$. Lemma: $I_BI=\\frac{2b*IB}{a}$ We draw the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$. Let the angle bisector of $\\angle ABC$ hit the circumcircle at a second point $M$. By the incenter-excenter lemma, $AM=CM=IM$. Let this distance be $\\alpha$. Ptolemy's theorem on $ABCM$ gives us\\[a\\alpha+b\\alpha=b(\\alpha+IB)\\to \\alpha=\\frac{b*IB}{a}\\]Again, by the incenter-excenter lemma, $II_B=2IM$ so $II_b=\\frac{2b*IB}{a}$ as desired. Using this gives us the following equation:\\[\\frac{2b*IB}{a}=r+\\frac{2rs}{s-a}+\\frac{rs}{s-b}\\]Motivated by the $s-a$ and $s-b$, we make the following substitution: $x=s-a, y=s-b$ This changes things quite a bit. Here's what we can get from it:\\[a=2y, b=x+y, s=x+2y\\]It is known (easily proved with Heron's and a=rs) that\\[r=\\sqrt{\\frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-b)}{s}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{xy^2}{x+2y}}\\]Using this, we can also find $IB$: let the midpoint of $BC$ be $N$. Using Pythagorean's Theorem on $\\triangle INB$,\\[IB^2=r^2+(\\frac{a}{2})^2=\\frac{xy^2}{x+2y}+y^2=\\frac{2xy^2+2y^3}{x+2y}=\\frac{2y^2(x+y)}{x+2y}\\]We now look at the RHS of the main equation:\\[r+\\frac{2rs}{s-a}+\\frac{rs}{s-b}=r(1+\\frac{2(x+2y)}{x}+\\frac{x+2y}{y})=r(\\frac{x^2+5xy+4y^2}{xy})=\\frac{r(x+4y)(x+y)}{xy}=\\frac{2(x+y)IB}{2y}\\]Cancelling some terms, we have\\[\\frac{r(x+4y)}{x}=IB\\]Squaring,\\[\\frac{2y^2(x+y)}{x+2y}=\\frac{(x+4y)^2*xy^2}{x^2(x+2y)}\\to \\frac{(x+4y)^2}{x}=2(x+y)\\]Expanding and moving terms around gives\\[(x-8y)(x+2y)=0\\to x=8y\\]Reverse substituting,\\[s-a=8s-8b\\to b=\\frac{9}{2}a\\]Clearly the smallest solution is $a=2$ and $b=9$, so our answer is $2+9+9=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In regular octagon $ABCDEFGH$, $M$ and $N$ are midpoints of $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{FG}$ respectively.
