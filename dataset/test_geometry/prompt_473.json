    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume, in cubic units, of a cube whose surface area is 600 square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The surface area of a cube equals 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces). If the cube has a sidelength of $s$, then the surface area equals $6s^2$. We set that equal to 600 and solve for $s$, which must be positive. $$600=6s^2\\qquad\\Rightarrow 100=s^2\\qquad\\Rightarrow 10=s$$ The volume of the cube is $s^3=10^3=\\boxed{1000}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has a surface area of 216 square centimeters. What is the volume of the cube, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are 6 faces to a cube, meaning that each face has area 36, and the edge has length 6, for a total volume of $6^3 = \\boxed{216}$ for the cube.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the value of $x$ if a cube's volume is $5x$ cubic units and its surface area is $x$ square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the cube's volume is $5x$ cubic units, each side measures $\\sqrt[3]{5x}$ units. The surface area is then $6(\\sqrt[3]{5x})^2$. We are told the surface area is also $x$. We have the equation $6(\\sqrt[3]{5x})^2=x$ Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\\boxed{5400}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangular prism has dimensions 8 inches by 2 inches by 32 inches. If a cube has the same volume as the prism, what is the surface area of the cube, in square inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cube has volume $8\\cdot2\\cdot32$ cubic inches, so its edge length is $\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot2\\cdot32}=\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot64}=\\sqrt[3]{8}\\sqrt[3]{64}=2\\cdot4=8$ inches.  The surface area of a cube with edge length 8 inches is $6(8\\text{ in.})^2=\\boxed{384}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the total volume in cubic feet of three boxes if each box is a cube with edge length 4 feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each box has volume $4^3=64$ cubic feet. Thus, three boxes have volume $64\\cdot3=\\boxed{192}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a given sphere is $36\\pi$ cubic inches. How many square inches are in its surface area? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Here, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=36\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\\pi(3^2)=\\boxed{36\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When each edge of a cube is increased by $50\\%$, by what percent is the surface area of the cube increased?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $s$ represent the length of the edge of a cube. The surface area of the cube is 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces), or $6s^2$. Increasing $s$ by $50\\%$ gives us $1.5s$. The new surface area is $6(1.5s)^2=6s^2(2.25)$. Increasing the surface area by $x\\%$ is $6s^2\\left(1+\\frac{x}{100}\\right)$, so we solve for $x$ when the surface area is $6s^2(2.25)$. $$2.25=1+\\frac{x}{100}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 1.25=\\frac{x}{100}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 125=x$$ The surface area increases by $\\boxed{125\\%}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume, in cubic inches, of a rectangular box, whose faces have areas of $24$ square inches, $16$ square inches and $6$ square inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular box, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=24$, $wh=16$, and $lh=6$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=24\\cdot16\\cdot6=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot2^4\\cdot2\\cdot3=2^8\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^4\\cdot3=\\boxed{48}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the ratio of the volume of a cube with edge length six inches to the volume of a cube with edge length one foot? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each side of the smaller cube is half that of the larger cube, so the ratio of the volumes is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of $1$ cubic foot?\n\nAnswer:\n",
