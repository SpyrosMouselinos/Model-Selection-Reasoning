Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A section is cut out of a circular piece of paper having radius four inches, as shown. Points A and B are then glued together to form a right circular cone. What is the circumference of the base of the resulting cone? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.

Then the circumference of the base of the cone is \\[\\frac{270^\\circ}{360^\\circ} \\cdot 8 \\pi = \\boxed{6 \\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cone has a volume of $12288\\pi$ cubic inches and the vertex angle of the vertical cross section is 60 degrees. What is the height of the cone? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.

The ratio of the base to the height of an equilateral triangle is 1 to $\\sqrt{3}/2$. In terms of the radius, $r$, the base is $2r$ and the height is $2r\\sqrt{3}/2$, or $r\\sqrt{3}$. Since we know the volume of the cone, we can use the volume formula and solve the equation  \\[(1/3) \\times \\pi \\times r^2 \\times r\\sqrt{3} = 12288\\pi\\]  for $r$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $\\pi$ gives  $(1/3)r^3\\sqrt{3} = 12288$. Tripling both sides, we get $r^3\\sqrt{3} = 36,\\!864$. Now, we want $r\\sqrt{3},$ so we multiply both sides by $3$ to get $r^3\\cdot(\\sqrt{3})^3 = (r\\sqrt{3})^3 = 36,\\!864 \\cdot 3 = 110,\\!592.$ Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $r\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{48.0}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The truncated right circular cone has a large base radius 8 cm and a small base radius of 4 cm.

We don't know the height of the small cone, so call it $x$.  Since the small and large cone are similar, we have $x/4=(x+6)/8$; solving yields $x=6$.  Hence the small cone has radius 4, height 6, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(4^2)(6)=32\\pi$ and the large cone has radius 8, height 12, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(8^2)(12)=256\\pi$.  The frustum's volume is the difference of these two volumes, or $256\\pi-32\\pi=\\boxed{224\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle with radius 4 cm is tangent to three sides of a rectangle, as shown.

Thus, the area of the rectangle is $32\\pi$.\n\nThe length of the shorter side of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the circle, so it is 8 centimeters long. This means that the length of the other side is $32\\pi/8 = \\boxed{4\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a cylinder is $54\\pi$ $\\text{cm}^3$. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone with the same radius and height as the cylinder? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$. [asy]\nimport solids; currentprojection=orthographic(0,100,25); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nrevolution cyl = cylinder((5,0,0),1,5,Z);\nrevolution cone = cone((0,0,0),1,5,Z);\ndraw(cyl,backpen=dashed);\ndraw(cone,backpen=dashed);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $(1/3)\\pi r^2 h$; a cylinder with the same radius and height has volume $\\pi r^2 h$.  Thus we see the volume of the corresponding cone has 1/3 the volume of the cylinder, which is $(1/3)(54\\pi = \\boxed{18\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A frustum of a right circular cone is formed by cutting a small cone off of the top of a larger cone.

When the triangle is rotated about the other leg, the volume of the cone produced is $1920\\pi \\;\\textrm{ cm}^3$. What is the length (in cm) of the hypotenuse of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let one leg of the triangle have length $a$ and let the other leg have length $b$. When we rotate around the leg of length $a$, the result is a cone of height $a$ and radius $b$, and so of volume $\\frac 13 \\pi ab^2 = 800\\pi$. Likewise, when we rotate around the leg of length $b$ we get a cone of height $b$ and radius $a$ and so of volume $\\frac13 \\pi b a^2 = 1920 \\pi$. If we divide this equation by the previous one, we get $\\frac ab = \\frac{\\frac13 \\pi b a^2}{\\frac 13 \\pi ab^2} = \\frac{1920}{800} = \\frac{12}{5}$, so $a = \\frac{12}{5}b$. Then $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{12}{5}b\\right)b^2 = 800\\pi$ so $b^3 = 1000$ and $b = 10$ so $a = 24$.
