    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$. Including the area of its circular base, what is the total surface area of a hemisphere with radius 6 cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport markers;\nsize(150);\nimport geometry;\ndraw((0,-7)--(0,-1),Arrow);\ndraw((10,10)--(5,5),Arrow);\nlabel(\"half of sphere\",(10,10),N);\nlabel(\"circular base\",(0,-7),S);\n\ndraw(scale(1,.2)*arc((0,0),10,0,180),dashed);\ndraw(scale(1,.2)*arc((0,0),10,180,360));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),10,0,180));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The base of the hemisphere is a circle with radius 6 and area $6^2\\pi=36\\pi$.  The curved top of the hemisphere has half the surface area of a full sphere, which has surface area $4\\pi(6^2)=144\\pi$, so the curved top of the hemisphere has $144\\pi/2=72\\pi$.  The total surface area of the hemisphere is $36\\pi+72\\pi=\\boxed{108\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, angle $ACB$ is 50 degrees, and angle $CBA$ is 70 degrees.  Let $D$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $BC$, $O$ the center of the circle circumscribed about triangle $ABC$, and $E$ the other end of the diameter which goes through $A$.  Find the angle $DAE$, in degrees.\n\n[asy]\n\nunitsize(1.5 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, O;\n\nA = dir(90);\n\nB = dir(90 + 100);\n\nC = dir(90 - 140);\n\nD = (A + reflect(B,C)*(A))/2;\n\nE = -A;\n\nO = (0,0);\n\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\n\ndraw(A--D);\n\ndraw(A--E,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, W);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, S);\n\ndot(\"$O$\", O, dir(0));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since triangle $ACD$ is right, $\\angle CAD = 90^\\circ - \\angle ACD = 90^\\circ - 50^\\circ = 40^\\circ$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, O;\n\nA = dir(90);\nB = dir(90 + 100);\nC = dir(90 - 140);\nD = (A + reflect(B,C)*(A))/2;\nE = -A;\nO = (0,0);\n\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(A--E);\ndraw(O--C);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, W);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, S);\ndot(\"$O$\", O, NE);\n[/asy]\n\nAlso, $\\angle AOC = 2 \\angle ABC = 2 \\cdot 70^\\circ = 140^\\circ$.  Since triangle $ACO$ is isosceles with $AO = CO$, $\\angle CAO = (180^\\circ - \\angle AOC)/2 = (180^\\circ - 140^\\circ)/2 = 20^\\circ$.  Hence, $\\angle DAE = \\angle CAD - \\angle CAO = 40^\\circ - 20^\\circ = \\boxed{20^\\circ}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The circumference of a circle $A$ is 60 feet. How many feet long is $\\widehat{BC}$? [asy]\nimport markers;\n\nimport olympiad; import geometry; import graph; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.9));\ndraw(Circle(origin,1));\ndraw(dir(90)--origin--dir(30));\nlabel(\"$B$\",dir(90),N);\nlabel(\"$A$\",origin,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",dir(30),E);\nmarkangle(Label(\"$60^{\\circ}$\"),dir(30),origin,(0,1),radius=20);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $\\widehat{BC}$ is $\\frac{60}{360}=\\frac16$ of the circle, $\\widehat{BC}$ has length $\\frac16(60)=\\boxed{10}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A machine-shop cutting tool has the shape of a notched circle, as shown. The radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{50}$ cm, the length of $AB$ is $6$ cm and that of $BC$ is $2$ cm. The angle $ABC$ is a right angle. Find the square of the distance (in centimeters) from $B$ to the center of the circle.\n[asy] size(150);  defaultpen(linewidth(0.6)+fontsize(11)); real r=10; pair O=(0,0), A=r*dir(45),B=(A.x,A.y-r),C; path P=circle(O,r); C=intersectionpoint(B--(B.x+r,B.y),P); draw(P); draw(C--B--A--B); dot(A); dot(B); dot(C); label(\"$A$\",A,NE); label(\"$B$\",B,S); label(\"$C$\",C,SE); [/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We use coordinates. Let the circle have center $(0,0)$ and radius $\\sqrt{50}$; this circle has equation $x^2 + y^2 = 50$. Let the coordinates of $B$ be $(a,b)$. We want to find $a^2 + b^2$. $A$ and $C$ with coordinates $(a,b+6)$ and $(a+2,b)$, respectively, both lie on the circle. From this we obtain the system of equations\n$a^2 + (b+6)^2 = 50$\n$(a+2)^2 + b^2 = 50$\nSolving, we get $a=5$ and $b=-1$, so the distance is $a^2 + b^2 = \\boxed{26}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of degrees in the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n[asy]\nsize(200);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),5),linewidth(1.2));\npair[] mins;\nfor(int i = 0; i < 60; ++i){\n\nmins[i] = 4.5*dir(-6*i + 90);\n\ndot(mins[i]);\n}\nfor(int i = 1; i <= 12; ++i){\n\nlabel((string)i,mins[5*i % 60],dir(-30*i - 90));\n}\n\nfill(Circle((0,0),0.25));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two circles of radius 10 cm overlap such that each circle passes through the center of the other, as shown. How long, in cm, is the common chord (dotted segment) of the two circles? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10),linewidth(1));\ndraw(Circle((10,0),10),linewidth(1));\ndot((0,0));\ndot((10,0));\ndraw((5,8.66)--(5,-8.66),linetype(\"0 4\")+linewidth(1));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10),linewidth(1));\ndraw(Circle((10,0),10),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(5,8.66)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((5,8.66)--(5,-8.66),linetype(\"0 4\")+linewidth(1));\n[/asy] The triangle is equilateral, since the three sides are equal radii. The common chord is twice an altitude of the triangle. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{10^2\\sqrt3}{4}=25\\sqrt3$ sq cm, so the altitude (length $h$ cm) has $\\frac{10h}{2}=25\\sqrt{3}$ or $h=5\\sqrt3$. The chord is twice this or $\\boxed{10\\sqrt3}$ cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the figure below, the smaller circle has a radius of two feet and the larger circle has a radius of four feet. What is the total area of the four shaded regions? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n\n[asy]\nfill((0,0)--(12,0)--(12,-4)--(4,-4)--(4,-2)--(0,-2)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(12,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,-2),linewidth(1));\ndraw((4,0)--(4,-4),linewidth(1));\ndraw((12,0)--(12,-4),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0.3,0)--(0.3,-0.3)--(0,-0.3));\ndraw((4.3,0)--(4.3,-0.3)--(4,-0.3));\ndraw((11.7,0)--(11.7,-0.3)--(12,-0.3));\nfill(Circle((2,-2),2),white);\nfill(Circle((8,-4),4),white);\ndraw(Circle((2,-2),2));\ndraw(Circle((8,-4),4));\ndot((2,-2));\ndot((8,-4));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Draw horizontal diameters of both circles to form two rectangles, both surrounding shaded regions. The height of each rectangle is a radius and the length is a diameter, so the left rectangle is 2 ft $\\times$ 4 ft and the right rectangle is 4 ft $\\times$ 8 ft. The shaded region is obtained by subtracting respective semicircles from each rectangle, so the total area of the shaded region in square feet is $A = [(2)(4) - \\dfrac{1}{2}\\pi \\cdot(2)^2] +\n[(4)(8) - \\dfrac{1}{2}\\pi \\cdot(4)^2] = 40 - 10\\pi \\approx \\boxed{8.6}$.\n\nEquivalently, we could notice that since the right side of the figure is scaled up from the left side by a factor of 2, areas will be scaled by a factor of $2^2 = 4$, and the right shaded region will be 4 times the size of the left shaded region. Then $A = 5[(2)(4) - \\dfrac{1}{2}\\pi \\cdot(2)^2],$ giving the same result.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $DEF$, we have $\\angle D = 25^\\circ$, $\\angle E = 90^\\circ$, and $EF = 9$.  Find $DE$ to the nearest tenth.  You may use a calculator for this problem.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We start with a diagram:\n\n[asy]\npair D,EE,F;\n\nEE = (0,0);\nF = (8,0);\nD = (0,8*Tan(65));\ndraw(D--EE--F--D);\ndraw(rightanglemark(F,EE,D,18));\nlabel(\"$E$\",EE,SW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\nlabel(\"$9$\",F/2,S);\n[/asy]\n\nWe seek $DE$, and we have $EF$ and $\\angle D$.  We can relate these three with the tangent function: \\[\\tan D = \\frac{EF}{DE},\\]so  \\[DE = \\frac{EF}{\\tan D} = \\frac{9}{\\tan D} \\approx \\boxed{19.3}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $T$ has a circumference of $12\\pi$ inches, and segment $XY$ is a diameter. If the measure of angle $TXZ$ is $60^{\\circ}$, what is the length, in inches, of segment $XZ$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),13),linewidth(1));\ndraw((-12,-5)--(-5,-12)--(12,5)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndot((0,0));\n\nlabel(\"T\",(0,0),N);\nlabel(\"X\",(-12,-5),W);\nlabel(\"Z\",(-5,-12),S);\nlabel(\"Y\",(12,5),E);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can begin by using the circumference to solve for the radius of the circle.  If the circumference is $12\\pi$, then $2\\pi r=12\\pi$ which implies $r=6$.  Now, we can draw in the radius $TZ$ as shown: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),13),linewidth(1));\ndraw((-12,-5)--(-5,-12)--(12,5)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(-5,-12),linewidth(1)+linetype(\"0 4\"));\ndot((0,0));\n\nlabel(\"T\",(0,0),N);\nlabel(\"X\",(-12,-5),W);\nlabel(\"Z\",(-5,-12),S);\nlabel(\"Y\",(12,5),E);\n\n[/asy]\n\nWe know that $TX=TZ$, since both are radii of length 6.  We are given $\\angle TXZ=60^{\\circ}$, so $\\angle TZX=60^{\\circ}$, and triangle $TXZ$ is equilateral.  Thus, $TX=TZ=XZ=\\boxed{6}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the diagram, each of the three identical circles touch the other two.  The circumference of each circle is 36.  What is the perimeter of the shaded region? [asy]\n\ndefaultpen(1);\n\npath p = (1, 0){down}..{-dir(30)}dir(-60){dir(30)}..{dir(-30)}((2, 0) + dir(-120)){-dir(-30)}..{up}(1, 0)--cycle;\nfill(p, gray(0.75));\n\ndraw(unitcircle);\ndraw(shift(2 * dir(-60)) * unitcircle);\ndraw(shift(2) * unitcircle);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Join the centre of each circle to the centre of the other two. Since each circle touches each of the other two, then these line segments pass through the points where the circles touch, and each is of equal length (that is, is equal to twice the length of the radius of one of the circles). [asy]\nimport olympiad;\ndefaultpen(1);\n\npath p = (1, 0){down}..{-dir(30)}dir(-60){dir(30)}..{dir(-30)}((2, 0) + dir(-120)){-dir(-30)}..{up}(1, 0)--cycle;\nfill(p, gray(0.75));\n\ndraw(unitcircle);\ndraw(shift(2 * dir(-60)) * unitcircle);\ndraw(shift(2) * unitcircle);\n\n// Add lines\ndraw((0, 0)--(2, 0)--(2 * dir(-60))--cycle);\n\n// Add ticks\nadd(pathticks((0, 0)--(1, 0), s=4)); add(pathticks((1, 0)--(2, 0), s=4));\nadd(pathticks((0, 0)--dir(-60), s=4)); add(pathticks(dir(-60)--(2 * dir(-60)), s=4));\nadd(pathticks((2 * dir(-60))--(2 * dir(-60) + dir(60)), s=4)); add(pathticks((2, 0)--(2 * dir(-60) + dir(60)), s=4));\n\n[/asy]\n\nSince each of these line segments have equal length, then the triangle that they form is equilateral, and so each of its angles is equal to $60^\\circ$.\n\nNow, the perimeter of the shaded region is equal to the sum of the lengths of the three circular arcs which enclose it.  Each of these arcs is the arc of one of the circles between the points where this circle touches the other two circles.\n\nThus, each arc is a $60^\\circ$ arc of one of the circles (since the radii joining either end of each arc to the centre of its circle form an angle of $60^\\circ$), so each arc is $\\frac{60^\\circ}{360^\\circ} = \\frac{1}{6}$ of the total circumference of the circle, so each arc has length $\\frac{1}{6}(36)=6$.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the shaded region is $3(6) = \\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Assume that the length of Earth's equator is exactly 25,100 miles and that the Earth is a perfect sphere. The town of Lena, Wisconsin, is at $45^{\\circ}$ North Latitude, exactly halfway between the equator and the North Pole. What is the number of miles in the circumference of the circle on Earth parallel to the equator and through Lena, Wisconsin? Express your answer to the nearest hundred miles.
