    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many units are in the sum of the lengths of the two longest altitudes in a triangle with sides $8,$ $15,$ and $17$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We recognize 8, 15, and 17 as a Pythagorean triple. Since the hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse is the shortest of the altitudes. The other two altitudes are just the legs themselves, therefore $8 + 15 = \\boxed{23}.$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If a triangle has two sides of lengths 5 and 7 units, then how many different integer lengths can the third side be?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $n$ be the length of the third side.  Then by the triangle inequality, \\begin{align*}\nn + 5 &> 7, \\\\\nn + 7 &> 5, \\\\\n5 + 7 &> n,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $n > 2$, $n > -2$, and $n < 12$.  Hence, the possible values of $n$ are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, for a total of $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are consecutive whole numbers is 29 units. What is the sum of the lengths of the two legs?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let's call the length of the shorter leg $x$. Then the length of the longer leg is $x + 1$. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we write the equation $x^2 + (x + 1)^2 = 29^2$ and solve for $x$. Expanding $(x + 1)^2$, we get $x\n^2 + x^2 + 2x + 1 = 841$. This can be simplified to $2x^2 + 2x = 840$, or $x^2 + x = 420$. Factoring out $x$ on the left, we can rewrite it as $x(x + 1) = 420$. In other words, the product of these two consecutive numbers is 420, which means they must each be close to the square root of 420. Indeed, $20 \\times 21 = 420$, so the legs must be 20 and 21. Their sum is $20 + 21 = \\boxed{41}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 33 units and 42 units. The third side also has an integral length. What is the least possible number of units in the perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The sum of the smaller two sides must exceed the greatest side, so if $x$ is the missing side then $x+33>42\\implies x>9$.  The smallest integer greater than 9 is 10, so the least perimeter is $10+33+42=\\boxed{85}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The sides of a triangle have lengths of $15$, $20$, and $25$. Find the length of the shortest altitude.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First notice that this is a right triangle, so two of the altitudes are the legs, whose lengths are $15$ and $20$.  The third altitude, whose length is  $x$, is the one drawn to the hypotenuse. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(15)(20) = 150$. Using 25 as the base and $x$ as the altitude, we have $$\n\\frac{1}{2}(25)x = 150, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad\nx = \\frac{300}{25} = \\boxed{12}.\n$$\n\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(15,0)--(0,20)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(9.6,7.2),dashed);\nlabel(\"15\",(7.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"20\",(0,10),W);\nlabel(\"25\",(7.5,10),NE);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(4.8,3.6),N);\n[/asy]\n\n$$\n\\text{OR}\n$$\n\nSince the three right triangles in the figure are similar, $$\n\\frac{x}{15} = \\frac{20}{25}, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad\nx=\\frac{300}{25} = \\boxed{12}.\n$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is inscribed in a circle of radius 3.  What is the area of the triangle? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$.  The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.  Thus $5x=2\\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$.  The area of the triangle is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3x\\cdot 4x =\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{18}{5}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}\n=\\frac{216}{25}=\\boxed{8.64}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has vertices at $(-3,2),(6,-2),(3,5)$.

The area of the fourth triangle is $63-37.5=\\boxed{25.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many different triangles can be formed having a perimeter of 7 units if each side must have integral length?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $a,b,$ and $c$ represent the three side lengths of the triangle. The perimeter is $a+b+c=7,$ so $b+c=7-a$. We know by the Triangle Inequality that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle must be greater than the third side length. If we focus on the variable $a$, we have\n\\[b+c>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 7-a>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 3.5>a.\\]We could easily replace $a$ with $b$ or $c$, so the maximum length of any of the three sides is $3$. If $a=3$, then $b+c=4$ and $b$ and $c$ could be $1$ and $3$ in some order or $2$ and $2$ in some order. If we let $a=2$ or $a=1$ and the maximum side length is $3$, we'll still end up with triangles of side lengths $(1,3,3)$ or $(2,2,3)$. There are $\\boxed{2}$ different triangles.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the triangle so that angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $C$ measures 30 degrees.  Define $D$ to be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to side $AC$.  Because angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $ADB$ is a right angle, triangle $ADB$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Since the length of a leg of a 45-45-90 triangle is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ times the length of the hypotenuse, $AD=BD=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot 6\\sqrt{2}=6$ units.  Also, $CDB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so we can multiply the short leg $BD$ by 2 to find the length of the hypotenuse and by $\\sqrt{3}$ to find the length of the longer leg.  This gives $BC=12$ units and $CD=6\\sqrt{3}$ units.  The sum of the lengths of sides $AC$ and $BC$ is $6+6\\sqrt{3}+12=18+6\\sqrt{3}$.  To the nearest tenth of a unit, this is $\\boxed{28.4}$ units.
