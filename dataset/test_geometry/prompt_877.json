    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and a point $K$ on $BC$ such that $AK$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$. If $AC = 10,$ $BK = 7$, and $BC = 13,$ then what is the area of $\\triangle ABC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we sketch! [asy]\npair A, B, C, K;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-7, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nK = (0, 0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--K);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$K$\", K, NE);\nlabel(\"10\", C--A, NE);\nlabel(\"7\", B--K, N);\nlabel(\"13\", B--C, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,K,B,10));\n[/asy] We now see that $CK = BC - BK = 6.$ That means $\\triangle AKC$ is a $3:4:5$ right triangle, so $AK = 8.$ At this point, we can see that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AK \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{52}.$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 7$, $AC = 15$, and the length of median $AM$ is 10.  Find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Extend $AM$ to $D$ so that $MD = MA$.  Then triangles $AMB$ and $DMC$ are congruent, so triangles $ABC$ and $ACD$ have equal area.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, M;\n\nA = (-7/sqrt(37),42/sqrt(37));\nB = (0,0);\nC = (2*sqrt(37),0);\nM = (B + C)/2;\nD = 2*M - A;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D--C);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$7$\", (A + B)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$15$\", (A + C)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (A + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (D + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$7$\", (C + D)/2, E);\n[/asy]\n\nThe semi-perimeter of triangle $ACD$ is $(7 + 15 + 20)/2 = 21$, so by Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ACD$ is $$\\sqrt{21 (21 - 7)(21 - 15)(21 - 20)} = \\boxed{42}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 16$, $AC = 24$, $BC = 19$, and $AD$ is an angle bisector.  Find the ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$.  (Express your answer as a fraction in lowest terms.)\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$ is $BD/CD$.  By the angle bisector theorem, $BD/CD = AB/AC = 16/24 = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has sides of length 5, 12 and 13 units, and triangle $DEF$ has sides of length 8, 15 and 17 units. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $DEF$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are both right, since their sides form Pythagorean triples. It follows that the desired ratio is $\\dfrac{(5\\cdot 12)/2}{(8\\cdot 15)/2} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $A(1, 1), B(6, 1), C(3, 7)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that $AB$ has length 5 and is parallel to the $x$-axis. Therefore, the height of the triangle is the difference in the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$, or $7-1 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = \\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = AC=7$ and $BC=6$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=10$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{10\\cdot 3\\cdot 3\\cdot 4} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 10,$$ which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{5}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $ABC$, $AB=9$, $BC=13$, and $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$.  Points $D$ and $E$ are midpoints of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{AC}$ respectively; $\\overline{CD}$ and $\\overline{BE}$ intersect at point $X$.  Compute the ratio of the area of quadrilateral $AEXD$ to the area of triangle $BXC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We begin by drawing a diagram: [asy]\npair A,B,C,D,E,X;\nA=(0,9); B=(0,0); C=(13,0); E=(A+C)/2; D=(A+B)/2; X = intersectionpoint(B--E,D--C); label(\"$X$\",X,N);\nfill(A--E--X--D--cycle,rgb(135,206,250));\n\nfill(B--X--C--cycle,rgb(107,142,35));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--D); draw(B--E);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,15));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW); label(\"$B$\",B,SW); label(\"$C$\",C,SE); label(\"$D$\",D,W); label(\"$E$\",E,NE);\n\nlabel(\"$13$\",(6.5,0),S); label(\"$9$\",(-2,4.5),W);\n\ndraw((-2.7,5.3)--(-2.7,9),EndArrow(TeXHead));draw((-2.7,3.7)--(-2.7,0),EndArrow(TeXHead));\n[/asy]\n\nSince $D$ and $E$ are midpoints, $\\overline{CD}$ and $\\overline{BE}$ are medians.  Let $F$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$; we draw median $\\overline{AF}$.  The medians of a triangle are always concurrent (pass through the same point), so $\\overline{AF}$ passes through $X$ as well.\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,D,E,X,F;\nA=(0,9); B=(0,0); C=(13,0); E=(A+C)/2; D=(A+B)/2; X = intersectionpoint(B--E,D--C); label(\"$X$\",X,N);\n\nF=(B+C)/2; draw(A--F,dashed); label(\"$F$\",F,S);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--D); draw(B--E);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,15));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW); label(\"$B$\",B,SW); label(\"$C$\",C,SE); label(\"$D$\",D,W); label(\"$E$\",E,NE);\n\n[/asy]\n\nThe three medians cut triangle $ABC$ into six smaller triangles.  These six smaller triangles all have the same area.  (To see why, look at $\\overline{BC}$ and notice that $\\triangle BXF$ and $\\triangle CXF$ have the same area since they share an altitude and have equal base lengths, and $\\triangle ABF$ and $\\triangle ACF$ have the same area for the same reason.  Thus, $\\triangle ABX$ and $\\triangle ACX$ have the same area.  We can repeat this argument with all three sizes of triangles built off the other two sides $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB}$, to see that the six small triangles must all have the same area.)\n\nQuadrilateral $AEXD$ is made up of two of these small triangles and triangle $BXC$ is made up of two of these small triangles as well.  Hence they have the same area (and this will hold true no matter what type of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ is).  Thus, the ratio of the area of quadrilateral $AEXD$ to the area of triangle $BXC$ is $1/1=\\boxed{1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 5$, $BC = 8$, and the length of median $AM$ is 4.  Find $AC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $BC = 8$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $BM = CM = 4$.  But $AM = 4$, so $M$ is the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$.  Furthermore, $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, so $\\angle BAC = 90^\\circ$.\n\n[asy]\n\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, M;\n\nA = dir(110);\n\nB = (-1,0);\n\nC = (1,0);\n\nM = (0,0);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\n\ndraw(A--M);\n\ndraw(Circle(M,1));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\n\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\n\ndot(\"$M$\", M, S);\n\n[/asy]\n\nThen by Pythagoras on right triangle $ABC$, $AC = \\sqrt{BC^2 - AB^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 - 5^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 25} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{39}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $ABC$, $AB=10$, $AC=6$ and $BC=8$ units.  What is the distance from $C$ to the midpoint of segment $AB$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse.  Therefore, the desired distance is $10/2 = \\boxed{5}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 5, AC=6, BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=9$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{9\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{3^3\\cdot 2^3} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{6}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{6} = r\\cdot 9,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $X$ and $Y$ lie on sides $AB$ and $AC$ respectively of triangle $ABC$. If $AB=7$, $AC=10$, $AX=4$ and $AY=6$, what is the ratio of the area of triangle $AXY$ to the area of triangle $ABC$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
