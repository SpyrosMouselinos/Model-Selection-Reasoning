    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $(1,-5)$ and $(11,7)$ are the opposite vertices of a parallelogram.  What are the coordinates of the point where the diagonals of the parallelogram intersect?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The diagonals of a parallelogram intersect at the midpoint of each diagonal. So, we simply find the midpoint of $(1,-5)$ and $(11,7)$, which is $\\left(\\frac{1+11}{2}, \\frac{-5+7}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{(6,1)}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In parallelogram $ABCD$, $AB = 38$ cm, $BC = 3y^3$ cm, $CD = 2x +4$ cm, and $AD = 24$ cm. What is the product of $x$ and $y$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since opposite sides of a parallelogram have the same length, we have the equations $$AB=CD\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad38=2x+4\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad x=17$$and $$BC=AD\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad3y^3=24\\qquad\\Rightarrow\\qquad y=2.$$The product of $x$ and $y$ is then $17\\cdot2=\\boxed{34}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many square units are in the area of the parallelogram with vertices at (0, 0), (6, 0), (2, 8) and (8, 8)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The measure of the base of the parallelogram is 6 units and the height of the parallelogram is 8 units.  Therefore, the area of the parallel is $(6)(8)=\\boxed{48}$ square units.

The perimeter of this parallelogram is $p$ units, while the area is $a$ square units. What is the value of the sum $p + a$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(5cm,5cm);\ndraw((-2,0)--(11,0));\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,4)--(10,4)--(7,0)--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(3,4)$\",(3,4),NW);\nlabel(\"$(7,0)$\",(7,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the bottom side of the parallelogram is 7 units, and the length of the left side of the parallelogram is $\\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5$ units, by the Pythagorean theorem.  Since the opposite two sides are congruent to these two, the perimeter of the parallelogram is $5+7+5+7=24$ units.  The area of the parallelogram is equal to its base times its height, which is $(7)(4)=28$ square units.  Therefore, $p+a=24+28=\\boxed{52}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The rectangle with vertices $(-1, y), (7, y), (-1, 3)$, and $(7, 3)$ has an area of 72 square units, and $y$ is positive. What is the value of $y$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First we write the rectangle's side lengths in terms of the coordinates provided. The length is $7-(-1)=8$ and the height is $y-3.$ It follows that $8(y-3)=72,$ and $y=\\boxed{12}.$ [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(4cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nxaxis(Arrows(4));\nyaxis(ymin=-2,Arrows(4));\npair A=(-1,12), B=(7,12), C=(-1,3), D=(7,3);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--D--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$8$\",(A+B)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$y-3$\",(B+D)/2,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Consider the parallelogram with vertices $(10,45)$, $(10,114)$, $(28,153)$, and $(28,84)$. A line through the origin cuts this figure into two congruent polygons. The slope of the line is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the first point on the line $x=10$ be $(10,45+a)$ where a is the height above $(10,45)$. Let the second point on the line $x=28$ be $(28, 153-a)$. For two given points, the line will pass the origin if the coordinates are proportional (such that $\\frac{y_1}{x_1} = \\frac{y_2}{x_2}$). Then, we can write that $\\frac{45 + a}{10} = \\frac{153 - a}{28}$. Solving for $a$ yields that $1530 - 10a = 1260 + 28a$, so $a=\\frac{270}{38}=\\frac{135}{19}$. The slope of the line (since it passes through the origin) is $\\frac{45 + \\frac{135}{19}}{10} = \\frac{99}{19}$, and the solution is $m + n = \\boxed{118}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Parallelogram $ABCD$ with $A(2,5)$, $B(4,9)$, $C(6,5)$, and $D(4,1)$ is reflected across the $x$-axis to $A'B'C'D'$ and then $A'B'C'D'$ is reflected across the line $y=x+1$ to $A''B''C''D''$. This is done such that $D'$ is the image of $D$, and $D''$ is the image of $D'$. What is the ordered pair of $D''$ in the coordinate plane?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Reflecting a point across the $x$-axis multiplies its $y$-coordinate by $-1$.  Therefore, $D'=(4,-1)$.  To reflect $D'$ across the line $y=x+1$, we first translate both the line and the point down one unit so that the equation of the translated line is $y=x$ and the coordinates of the translated point are $(4,-2)$.  To reflect across $y=x$, we switch the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate to obtain $(-2,4)$.  Translating this point one unit up, we find that $D''=\\boxed{(-2,5)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $A$ has coordinates $(x,6)$. When Point $A$ is reflected over the $y$-axis it lands on Point $B$. What is the sum of the four coordinate values of points $A$ and $B$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The coordinates of point $B$ are $(-x,6)$.  The sum of all four coordinates is $x+6+(-x)+6=\\boxed{12}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Parallelogram $ABCD$ has vertices $A(3,3)$, $B(-3,-3)$, $C(-9,-3)$, and $D(-3,3)$. If a point is selected at random from the region determined by the parallelogram, what is the probability that the point is not above the $x$-axis? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let us first call the point where the $x$-axis intersects side $\\overline{AB}$ point $E$ and where it intersects $\\overline{CD}$ point $F$. [asy]\ndraw((-12,0)--(6,0),Arrows);\ndraw((0,-6)--(0,6),Arrows);\n\nfor(int i = -11; i < 6; ++i)\n{\n\ndraw((i,.5)--(i,-.5));\n}\n\nfor(int i = -5; i < 6; ++i)\n{\n\ndraw((.5,i)--(-.5,i));\n}\n\ndot((3,3));\ndot((-3,-3));\ndot((-9,-3));\ndot((-3,3));\ndot((0,0));\ndot((-6,0));\n\ndraw((3,3)--(-3,-3)--(-9,-3)--(-3,3)--cycle, linewidth(.65));\ndraw((0,0)--(-6,0), linewidth(.65));\n\nlabel(\"A\",(3,3),NE);\nlabel(\"B\",(-3,-3),SE);\nlabel(\"C\",(-9,-3),SW);\nlabel(\"D\",(-3,3),NW);\nlabel(\"F\",(-6,0),NW);\nlabel(\"E\",(0,0),NW);\n[/asy] Now, since the $x$-axis is parallel to bases $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ of the parallelogram, $\\overline{EF}$ is parallel to the two bases and splits parallelogram $ABCD$ into two smaller parallelograms $AEFD$ and $EBCF$. Since the height of each of these parallelograms is $3$ and the length of their bases equals $AD=BC=6$, both parallelograms must have the same area. Half of parallelogram $ABCD$'s area is above the $x$-axis and half is below, so there is a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that the point selected is not above the $x$-axis.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $B$ has its center at $(-6, 2)$ and a radius of $10$ units. What is the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the two points on circle $B$ that are also on the $y$-axis?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that if the $y$-coordinate of one of the two points is $2+c$, then the $y$-coordinate of the other point must be $2-c$ because the two points must be equidistant from the line $y=2$. Therefore, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the two points on circle $B$ that are also on the $y$-axis is $\\boxed{4}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The coordinates of a parallelogram are (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4) and $(x, y)$ and $x > 7$. What is the value of $x + y$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
