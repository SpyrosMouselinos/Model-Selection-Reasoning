    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid with volume 40 cubic inches has a rectangular base. If the length of the base is doubled, the width tripled and the height increased by $50\\%$, what is the volume of the new pyramid, in cubic inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the volume of a pyramid is linear in each of length, width, and height (in particular, $V = \\frac{1}{3} lwh$), multiplying any of these dimensions by a scalar multiplies the volume by the same scalar.  So the new volume is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 1.50 = 9$ times the old one, or $\\boxed{360}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right, rectangular prism has three faces with areas of $6,8$ and $12$ square inches. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=6$, $wh=8$, and $lh=12$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=6\\cdot8\\cdot12=3\\cdot2\\cdot2^3\\cdot2^2\\cdot3=2^6\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^3\\cdot3=\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A solid box is 15 cm by 10 cm by 8 cm. A new solid is formed by removing a cube 3 cm on a side from each corner of this box. What percent of the original volume is removed?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The total volume of the eight removed cubes is $8\\times 3^{3}=216$ cubic centimeters, and the volume of the original box is $15\\times 10\\times 8 = 1200$ cubic centimeters. Therefore the volume has been reduced by $\\left(\\frac{216}{1200}\\right)(100\\%) = \\boxed{18\\%}. $\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangular box has interior dimensions 6-inches by 5-inches by 10-inches. The box is filled with as many solid 3-inch cubes as possible, with all of the cubes entirely inside the rectangular box. What percent of the volume of the box is taken up by the cubes?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Three-inch cubes can fill a rectangular box only if the edge lengths of the box are all integer multiples of 3 inches.  The largest such box whose dimensions are less than or equal to those of the $6''\\times5''\\times10''$ box is a $6''\\times3''\\times9''$ box.  The ratio of the volumes of these two boxes is  \\[\n\\frac{6\\cdot3\\cdot9}{6\\cdot5\\cdot10}=\\frac{3\\cdot9}{5\\cdot10}=\\frac{27}{50},\n\\] which is $\\boxed{54}$ percent.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Three faces of a right rectangular prism have areas of 48, 49 and 50 square units. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic units? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If the length, width, and height of the rectangular prism are $a$, $b$, and $c$, then we are given $ab=48$, $bc=49$, and $ac=50$.  Since we are looking for $abc$, the volume of the rectangular prism, we multiply these three equations to find \\begin{align*}\n(ab)(bc)(ac)&=48\\cdot49\\cdot50 \\implies \\\\\na^2b^2c^2&=48\\cdot49\\cdot 50 \\implies \\\\\n(abc)^2 &= 48\\cdot49\\cdot50 \\implies \\\\\nabc &= \\sqrt{48\\cdot49\\cdot50} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{(16\\cdot 3)\\cdot 7^2\\cdot(2\\cdot 5^2)} \\\\\n&= 4\\cdot7\\cdot5\\sqrt{2\\cdot3} \\\\\n&= 140\\sqrt{6},\n\\end{align*} which to the nearest whole number is $\\boxed{343}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cone is inverted and filled with water to 3/4 of its height.  What percent of the cone's volume is filled with water?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest ten-thousandth.  (You should enter 10.0000 for $10\\%$ instead of 0.1000.)\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cone have height $h$ and radius $r$, so its volume is \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2h.\\]When the cone is filled with water, the amount of water in the cone forms a smaller cone that is similar to the original cone.  This smaller cone has height $\\frac{3}{4}h$, and by similar triangles, radius $\\frac{3}{4}r$.  So, the smaller cone has volume \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{4}r\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}h\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi \\cdot \\frac{3^3}{4^3} r^2h.\\]Hence the ratio of the volume of the water-filled cone to the original cone is \\[\\frac{3^3}{4^3}=\\frac{27}{64}=0.421875,\\]which, as a percentage, is $\\boxed{42.1875}\\%$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When each edge of a cube is increased by $50\\%$, by what percent is the surface area of the cube increased?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $s$ represent the length of the edge of a cube. The surface area of the cube is 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces), or $6s^2$. Increasing $s$ by $50\\%$ gives us $1.5s$. The new surface area is $6(1.5s)^2=6s^2(2.25)$. Increasing the surface area by $x\\%$ is $6s^2\\left(1+\\frac{x}{100}\\right)$, so we solve for $x$ when the surface area is $6s^2(2.25)$. $$2.25=1+\\frac{x}{100}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 1.25=\\frac{x}{100}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 125=x$$ The surface area increases by $\\boxed{125\\%}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Eric builds a small pyramid for a school project. His pyramid has a height of twelve inches and a square base that measures ten inches on each side. Eric wants to find the smallest cube-shaped box to put his pyramid in so that he can safely bring it to school right side up. What is the volume of this box, in inches cubed?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The height of the pyramid is $12$ inches, so the height of the box must be at least $12$ inches. The base of the pyramid is $10$ inches on each side, so the minimum dimensions of the length and width of the box must be $10$. Since we want a cube-shaped box, we need to choose the dimensions of the box so that everything will fit inside. Because $12>10$, we want a cube-shaped box that measures $12$ inches on each side. (If we chose a box that measured $10$ inches on each side, it wouldn't be able to accommodate the height of the pyramid.) Therefore, the volume of the box is $12^3=\\boxed{1728}$ inches cubed.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The areas of three of the faces of a right, rectangular prism are $24 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2$, $32 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2$, and $48 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2$. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the three dimensions of the prism (length, width, and height, although not necessarily in that order) be $x,y,z$ such that $xy = 24$, $xz = 32$, and $yz = 48$.  Then the volume of the prism is $xyz$.  Multiplying our three equations together and taking the square root of both sides, we find that $xyz = \\sqrt{24\\cdot 32\\cdot 48} = \\boxed{192}$ cubic centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The width, length, and height of a rectangular prism are each increased by $10\\%$. What is the percent increase in the volume of the prism? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\n\nAnswer:\n",
