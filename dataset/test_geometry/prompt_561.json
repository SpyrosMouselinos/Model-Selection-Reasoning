Similarly, we have $OG=2+\\sqrt{2}$, so \\begin{align*}\n\\text{Area}(\\bigtriangleup ADG)&=\\frac{1}{2}(2+2\\sqrt{2})(2+\\sqrt{2})\\\\&=(1+\\sqrt{2})(2+\\sqrt{2})=\\boxed{4+3\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\end{align*} [asy]\nunitsize(1.75cm);\npair A,B,C,D,I,F,G,H,K;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(1,1);\nK=(1,0);\nC=(2.41,1);\nD=(3.41,0);\nI=(3.41,-1.41);\nF=(2.41,-2.41);\nG=(1,-2.41);\nH=(0,-1.41);\nlabel(\"2\",(1.7,1),N);\nlabel(\"2\",(1.7,0),N);\nlabel(\"2\",(1,-0.7),E);\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{2}$\",(0.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{2}$\",(2.91,0),N);\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{2}$\",(1,-1.7),E);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--I--F--G--H--cycle);\ndraw(A--D--G--cycle);\ndraw(H--I);\ndraw(B--G);\ndraw(C--F);\nlabel(\"$O$\",K,NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I,E);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$G$\",G,S);\nlabel(\"$H$\",H,W);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An octagon is inscribed in a square so that the vertices of the octagon trisect the sides of the square. The perimeter of the square is 108 centimeters. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the octagon?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each side of the square has length $27$. Each trisected segment therefore has length $9$. We can form the octagon by taking away four triangles, each of which has area $\\frac{(9)(9)}{2}$, for a total of $(2)(9)(9) = 162$. The total area of the square is $27^2=729$, so the area of the octagon is $729-162=\\boxed{567}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In regular octagon $ABCDEFGH$, $M$ and $N$ are midpoints of $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{FG}$ respectively.  Compute $[ABMO]/[EDCMO]$. ($[ABCD]$ denotes the area of polygon $ABCD$.)

Quadrilateral $ABMO$ is made up of three of these regions and pentagon $EDCMO$ is made up of five of these regions.  Hence, $[ABMO]/[EDCMO] = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{5}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular hexagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 2 units. In square units, what is the area of the hexagon? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect opposite pairs of vertices of the regular hexagon with line segments as shown.  Since each angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees, the six triangles produced are equilateral.  The diameter of the circle circumscribed around the hexagon is equal to twice the side length of each of the triangles.  Therefore, each triangle has side length 2 units.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ units is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$ square units.  (To show this, divide the equilateral triangle into two smaller 30-60-90 triangles.)  Substituting $s=2$, we find that the area of each triangle is $\\sqrt{3}$ square units.  Therefore, area of the hexagon is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(3.5cm);\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\n\nfor(i=0;i<=5;i=i+1)\n\n{\n\ndot((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\ndraw((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6))--(cos(2*pi*(i+1)/6),sin(2*pi*(i+1)/6)));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\n}\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle whose area is $324\\pi$ square units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that since the area is $\\pi r^2 = 324 \\pi$, where $r$ is the radius, we must have $r=\\sqrt{324}=18$. Thus the distance from the center of the hexagon to a vertex is $18$, and we can break up the hexagon into $6$ equilateral triangles, each of which has side length $18$. The area of an equilateral triangle of side length $s$ is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$, so the area of each equilateral triangle is $81 \\sqrt{3}$, making the total $6(81 \\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{486 \\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An equilateral triangle has an area of $64\\sqrt{3}$ $\\text{cm}^2$. If each side of the triangle is decreased by 4 cm, by how many square centimeters is the area decreased?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We first consider an equilateral triangle with side length $s$. If we construct an altitude, it will divide the equilateral triangle into two congruent $30-60-90$ triangles with the longest side having length $s$ and the altitude opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle. Since the side lengths of a $30-60-90$ triangle are in a $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$ ratio, the altitude will have length $\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Since the base of this equilateral triangle is $s$, its area will be $\\frac{1}{2}{b}{h}=\\frac{1}{2}s \\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nNow we can set this expression equal to $64\\sqrt{3}$ and solve for $s$ to find the side length of our original triangle. Doing this, we get that $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}=64\\sqrt{3}$. We can then multiply both sides of the equation by $\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$ to get that $s^2=256$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $s=16$, so the original triangle had a side length of $16$ cm. If we decrease this by $4$ cm, we get that the new triangle has side length $12$ cm and therefore has an area of $\\frac{144 \\sqrt{3}}{4}=36\\sqrt{3}$ cm. Therefore, the area is decreased by $64\\sqrt{3}-36\\sqrt{3}=\\boxed{28\\sqrt{3}}$ cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A quadrilateral in the plane has vertices $(1, 3)$, $(1, 1)$, $(2, 1)$ and $(2006, 2007)$. How many square units is the area of the quadrilateral?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The quadrilateral is shown below: [asy]\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,1)--(2,1)--(10,10.1)--(1,3)--cycle);\ndraw((1,1)--(10,10.1),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", (1,1), S);\nlabel(\"$B$\", (2,1), E);\nlabel(\"$C$\", (10,10.1), N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", (1,3), W);\n[/asy] Divide the quadrilateral into two triangles with the dashed line. We will find the area of these two triangles separately. Since $AB$ is horizontal, the area of triangle $ABC$ is half the product of the length $AB$ multiplied by the length of the vertical altitude from $C$ to line $AB$, or $\\frac{1\\cdot2006}{2}=1003$. Since $AD$ is vertical, the area of triangle $ACD$ is half the product of the length $AD$ multiplied by the length of the horizontal altitude from $C$ to line $AD$, or $\\frac{2\\cdot2005}{2}=2005$. The area of the entire quadrilateral is $1003+2005=\\boxed{3008}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle and O is the center of its inscribed circle. If the area of the circle is $4\\pi$ sq cm, what is the area, in square centimeters, of triangle ABC? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\nNote: The area of a circle with radius $r$ is $\\pi r^2.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we note that the radius of the inscribed circle is 2 cm (since $\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi$ implies that $r=2$, given that $r$ is nonnegative).\n\nLet $X$ be the midpoint of side $BC$. Thus segment $OX$ is a radius of the inscribed circle: [asy]\nunitsize(16);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2));\ndraw(((-2*sqrt(3),-2)--(2*sqrt(3),-2)--(0,4)--cycle));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,-2)));\ndraw(((-sqrt(3),1)--(0,0)--(sqrt(3),1)));\ndot((0,4)); label(\"A\",(0,4),N);\ndot((-2*sqrt(3),-2)); label(\"B\",(-2*sqrt(3),-2),SW);\ndot((2*sqrt(3),-2)); label(\"C\",(2*sqrt(3),-2),SE);\ndot((0,0)); label(\"O\",(0,0),N);\ndot((0,-2)); label(\"X\",(0,-2),S);\ndot((-sqrt(3),1)); dot((sqrt(3),1));\nlabel(\"2\",(0,-1),E);\n[/asy] Then $COX$ is a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so the sides $OX$, $CX$, and $CO$ are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Since $OX=2$, we have $CX=2\\sqrt 3$.\n\nTriangle $ACX$ is also a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so the sides $CX$, $AX$, and $AC$ are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Thus, $AX=(2\\sqrt3)(\\sqrt 3)=6$.\n\nTriangle $ABC$ has base $BC = 2(XC) = 4\\sqrt 3$ and corresponding height $AX = 6$, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}(4\\sqrt 3)(6) = \\boxed{12\\sqrt 3}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Given that $BDEF$ is a square and $AB = BC = 1$, find the number of square units in the area of the regular octagon.\n\n[asy]\nreal x = sqrt(2);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H;\nF=(0,0); E=(2,0); D=(2+x,x); C=(2+x,2+x);\nB=(2,2+2x); A=(0,2+2x); H=(-x,2+x); G=(-x,x);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--G--H--cycle);\ndraw((-x,0)--(2+x,0)--(2+x,2+2x)--(-x,2+2x)--cycle);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(-x,2+2x),NW); label(\"$D$\",(2+x,2+2x),NE); label(\"$E$\",(2+x,0),SE); label(\"$F$\",(-x,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-x,x+2),W); label(\"$C$\",(0,2+2x),N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n $\\triangle ABC$ is a right isosceles ($45^\\circ - 45^\\circ - 90^\\circ$) triangle, so $AC=AB\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2}$.  Thus, the side length of the octagon is $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe can compute the octagon's area by subtracting the area of the four right isosceles triangles from the area of square $BDEF$.\n\nThe four right isosceles triangles are congruent by symmetry and each has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1 \\cdot 1$, so their total area is \\[4\\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 2.\\]  Each side of square $BDEF$ is comprised of a leg of a right isosceles triangle, a side of the octagon, and another leg of a different right isosceles triangle.  Hence, the side length of $BDEF$ is $1+\\sqrt{2}+1=2+\\sqrt{2}$, and the area of $BDEF$ is \\[(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4+2+4\\sqrt{2}.\\] Finally, the area of the octagon is \\[4+2+4\\sqrt{2} - 2 = \\boxed{4+4\\sqrt{2}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A wire is cut into two pieces, one of length $a$ and the other of length $b$. The piece of length $a$ is bent to form an equilateral triangle, and the piece of length $b$ is bent to form a regular hexagon. The triangle and the hexagon have equal area. What is $\\frac{a}{b}$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The side length of the triangle and hexagon are $\\frac{a}{3}$ and $\\frac{b}{6},$ respectively, so their areas are \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\left(\\frac{a}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a^2 \\sqrt3}{36} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{3\\sqrt3}{2} \\left(\\frac{b}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{b^2\\sqrt3}{24},\\]respectively. Therefore, we have \\[\\frac{a^2\\sqrt3}{36} = \\frac{b^2\\sqrt3}{24},\\]so \\[\\frac{a^2}{b^2} = \\frac{36}{24} = \\frac{3}{2}.\\]Taking the square root of both sides, we get \\[\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{\\sqrt3}{\\sqrt2} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt6}2}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An equiangular octagon has four sides of length $1$ and four sides of length $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, arranged so that no two consecutive sides have the same length. What is the area of the octagon?\n\nAnswer:\n",
