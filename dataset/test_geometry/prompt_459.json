    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In $\\triangle ABC$ the median from $A$ is given perpendicular to the median from $B$. If $BC=7$ and $AC=6$, find the length of $AB$.\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 4\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{17} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 4.25\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 2\\sqrt{5} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 4.5$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]  draw((-16,0)--(8,0)); draw((-16,0)--(16,-24)); draw((16,-24)--(0,24)--(0,-12)); draw((-16,0)--(0,24)); draw((0,2)--(2,2)--(2,0)); draw((0,-12)--(8,0),dotted);  dot((16,-24)); label(\"C\",(16,-24),SE); dot((-16,0)); label(\"A\",(-16,0),W); dot((0,24)); label(\"B\",(0,24),N);  label(\"3\",(8,-18),SW); label(\"3\",(-8,-6),SW); label(\"3.5\",(12,-12),NE); label(\"3.5\",(4,12),NE);  dot((0,-12)); label(\"M\",(0,-12),SW); dot((8,0)); label(\"N\",(8,0),NE); dot((0,0)); label(\"G\",(0,0),NW);  [/asy]By SAS Similarity, $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle MNC$, so $AB \\parallel MN$. Thus, by AA Similarity, $\\triangle AGB \\sim \\triangle NGM$.\nLet $a = GN$ and $b = GM$, so $AG = 2a$ and $BG = 2b$. By the Pythagorean Theorem,\\[4a^2 + b^2 = 9\\]\\[a^2 + 4b^2 = \\frac{49}{4}\\]Adding the two equations yields $5a^2 + 5b^2 = \\frac{85}{4}$, so $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{17}{4}$. Thus, $MN = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{2}$, so $AB = \\boxed{\\sqrt{17}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ such that $AB = AC = 8$ and $BC = 10.$ What is the length of the median $AM$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let's draw a sketch first. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, we know that $AM$ must form a right angle with $BC.$ [asy]\npair A, B, C, M;\nA = (0, 6.24);\nB = (-5, 0);\nC = (5, 0);\nM = 0.5 * B + 0.5 * C;\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--M);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,M,B,10));\n[/asy] We know that $BM = MC = \\frac{BC}{2} = 5.$ Now we just simply apply the Pythagorean Theorem on the right triangle $\\triangle ABM.$ \\begin{align*}\nAM^2 &= AB^2 - BM^2\\\\\nAM^2 &= 8^2 - 5^2 = 39\\\\\nAM &= \\boxed{\\sqrt{39}}\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $ABC$, $AB=10$, $AC=6$ and $BC=8$ units.  What is the distance from $C$ to the midpoint of segment $AB$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse.  Therefore, the desired distance is $10/2 = \\boxed{5}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 5$, $BC = 8$, and the length of median $AM$ is 4.  Find $AC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $BC = 8$ and $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $BM = CM = 4$.  But $AM = 4$, so $M$ is the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$.  Furthermore, $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, so $\\angle BAC = 90^\\circ$.\n\n[asy]\n\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, M;\n\nA = dir(110);\n\nB = (-1,0);\n\nC = (1,0);\n\nM = (0,0);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\n\ndraw(A--M);\n\ndraw(Circle(M,1));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\n\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\n\ndot(\"$M$\", M, S);\n\n[/asy]\n\nThen by Pythagoras on right triangle $ABC$, $AC = \\sqrt{BC^2 - AB^2} = \\sqrt{8^2 - 5^2} = \\sqrt{64 - 25} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{39}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $BC = 8$.  The length of median $AD$ is 5.  Let $M$ be the largest possible value of $AB^2 + AC^2$, and let $m$ be the smallest possible value.  Find $M - m$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $AD$ is a median, $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, so $BD = CD = 4$.  Let $P$ be the projection of $A$ onto $BC$.  (Without loss of generality, we may assume that $P$ lies on $BD$.)  Let $x = BP$, so $PD = 4 - x$.  Let $h = AP$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.4 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, P;\n\nA = (4,12);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (14,0);\nD = (B + C)/2;\nP = (A + reflect(B,C)*(A))/2;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(A--P);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, SE);\nlabel(\"$P$\", P, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$x$\", (B + P)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$4 - x$\", (P + D)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$4$\", (D + C)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$5$\", (A + D)/2, E);\nlabel(\"$h$\", (A + P)/2, W);\n[/asy]\n\nThen by Pythagoras on right triangles $APB$, $APC$, and $APD$, \\begin{align*}\nAB^2 &= x^2 + h^2, \\\\\nAC^2 &= (8 - x)^2 + h^2, \\\\\n25 &= (4 - x)^2 + h^2.\n\\end{align*}Adding the first two equations, we get \\[AB^2 + AC^2 = x^2 + h^2 + (8 - x)^2 + h^2 = 2x^2 - 16x + 64 + 2h^2.\\]But from the third equation, $25 = x^2 - 8x + 16 + h^2$, so \\begin{align*}\nAB^2 + AC^2 &= 2x^2 - 16x + 64 + 2h^2 \\\\\n&= 2(x^2 - 8x + 16 + h^2) + 32 \\\\\n&= 2 \\cdot 25 + 32 \\\\\n&= 82.\n\\end{align*}Hence, from the given data, $AB^2 + AC^2$ can only take on the value 82.  Therefore, $M = m = 82$, so $M - m = \\boxed{0}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Medians are drawn from point $A$ and point $B$ in this right triangle to divide segments $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AC}$ in half, respectively. The lengths of the medians are 6 and $2\\sqrt{11}$ units, respectively. How many units are in the length of segment $\\overline{AB}$?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(7,0)--(0,4)--(0,0)--cycle,linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,1/2)--(1/2,1/2)--(1/2,0),linewidth(1));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,4),NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(7,0),E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(0,0),SW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We draw the medians as shown below.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(7,0)--(0,4)--(0,0)--cycle,linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,1/2)--(1/2,1/2)--(1/2,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,4)--(3.5,0));\ndraw((0,2)--(7,0));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,4),NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(7,0),E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$M$\",(3.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$N$\",(0,2),W);\n[/asy]\n\nFrom right triangles $ACM$ and $BCN$, we have \\begin{align*}\nAC^2 + CM^2 &= 36,\\\\\nBC^2 + CN^2 &= (2\\sqrt{11})^2 = 44.\\end{align*}\n\nHowever, we have $CM = BC/2$ and $CN = AC/2$, so the equations above become \\begin{align*}\nAC^2 + \\frac14BC^2 &= 36,\\\\\nBC^2 + \\frac14AC^2 &=44.\n\\end{align*}\n\nAdding these equations gives  \\[\\frac54(AC^2 + BC^2) = 80,\\] so $AC^2 + BC^2 = 64$.  But the Pythagorean Theorem gives us $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$, so $AB^2 = 64$, which means $AB = \\boxed{8}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let triangle $ABC$ be a right triangle in the xy-plane with a right angle at $C$. Given that the length of the hypotenuse $AB$ is $60$, and that the medians through $A$ and $B$ lie along the lines $y=x+3$ and $y=2x+4$ respectively, find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Translate so the medians are $y = x$, and $y = 2x$, then model the points $A: (a,a)$ and $B: (b,2b)$. $(0,0)$ is the centroid, and is the average of the vertices, so $C: (- a - b, - a - 2b)$\n$AB = 60$ so\n$3600 = (a - b)^2 + (2b - a)^2$\n$3600 = 2a^2 + 5b^2 - 6ab \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)$\n$AC$ and $BC$ are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is $-1$, giving\n$\\left(\\frac {2a + 2b}{2a + b}\\right)\\left(\\frac {a + 4b}{a + 2b}\\right) = - 1$\n$2a^2 + 5b^2 = - \\frac {15}{2}ab \\ \\ \\ \\  (2)$\nCombining $(1)$ and $(2)$, we get $ab = - \\frac {800}{3}$\nUsing the determinant product for area of a triangle (this simplifies nicely, add columns 1 and 2, add rows 2 and 3), the area is $\\left|\\frac {3}{2}ab\\right|$, so we get the answer to be $\\boxed{400}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Suppose that we have a right triangle $ABC$ with the right angle at $B$ such that $AC = \\sqrt{61}$ and $AB = 5.$ A circle is drawn with its center on $AB$ such that the circle is tangent to $AC$ and $BC.$ If $P$ is the point where the circle and side $AC$ meet, then what is $CP$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since we have a right triangle, we can see that any circle with center on $AB$ is tangent to $BC$ at the right angle itself, or $B.$ Since $P$ is the point at which $AC$ and the circle meet, we see that $CP$ is a tangent from $C,$ as is $BC.$ That means $BC = CP.$ We can easily find $BC$ via the Pythagorean Theorem, as $AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2.$ Plugging in $(5)^2 + BC^2 = (\\sqrt{61})^2,$ we can find $BC = CP = \\boxed{6}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Right triangle $ABC$ has one leg of length 6 cm, one leg of length 8 cm and a right angle at $A$. A square has one side on the hypotenuse of triangle $ABC$ and a vertex on each of the two legs of triangle $ABC$. What is the length of one side of the square, in cm? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nsize(4cm,4cm);\n\npair A,B,C;\n\nA=(0,0);\nB=(2,3);\nC=(7,0);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--A);\n\npair a,b,c,d;\n\na=(2/3)*B+(1/3)*A;\nb=(2/3)*B+(1/3)*C;\nc=(1.339,0);\nd=(3.65,0);\n\ndraw(c--a--b--d);\n\npair x,y,z;\n\nx=(9/10)*B+(1/10)*A;\nz=(14/15)*B+(1/15)*C;\ny=(2.12,2.5);\n\ndraw(x--y--z);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $s$ be the side length of the square. Also let $D$ be the vertex of the square on side $AC$, and let $E$ be the vertex of the square on side $AB$. Let $F$ and $G$ be the feet of the altitudes from $D$ and $A$ to $BC$, respectively. Let $x$ be the length of $AD$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, X, Y;\n\nA = (6^2/10,6*8/10);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (10,0);\nG = (6^2/10,0);\nX = (0,-10);\nY = (10,-10);\nF = extension(A,Y,B,C);\nD = extension(F,F + A - G,A,C);\nE = extension(D,D + B - C,A,B);\nH = E + F - D;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(H--E--D--F);\ndraw(A--G);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NW);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, S);\nlabel(\"$G$\", G, S);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (A + D)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$8 - x$\", (D + C)/2, NE);\n[/asy]\n\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that $AC > AB$, as in the diagram. From the given information, we know that $AC = 8$, $BC = 10$, and $DC = 8-x$. We can find that $AG = AB\\cdot AC/BC = 4.8$.\n\nFrom similar triangles $AED$ and $ABC$, we find that $s/10 = x/8$. From similar triangles $DFC$ and $AGC$, we have $s/4.8 = (8-x)/8$. Summing these two equations, we have $$\\frac{s}{10} + \\frac{s}{4.8} = \\frac{x}{8} + \\frac{8-x}{8}$$$$\\frac{14.8s}{48} = 1.$$Solving for $s$, we find that $s = \\boxed{\\frac{120}{37}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse of an isosceles, right triangle is $10$ units.  What is the length of a leg of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse, so the hypotenuse is $10\\cdot2=20$ units long. Since the right triangle is isosceles, the length of a leg is $20/\\sqrt{2}=\\boxed{10\\sqrt{2}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a right triangle $\\triangle ABC$ where the legs $AB$ and $BC$ have lengths $6$ and $3\\sqrt{3},$ respectively. Medians $AM$ and $CN$ meet at point $P.$ What is the length of $CP$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
