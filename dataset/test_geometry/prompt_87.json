    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In $\\triangle ABC,$ $AB=AC=25$ and $BC=23.$  Points $D,E,$ and $F$ are on sides $\\overline{AB},$ $\\overline{BC},$ and $\\overline{AC},$ respectively, such that $\\overline{DE}$ and $\\overline{EF}$ are parallel to $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB},$ respectively.  What is the perimeter of parallelogram $ADEF$?\n[asy]\nreal r=5/7;\npair A=(10,sqrt(28^2-100)),B=origin,C=(20,0),D=(A.x*r,A.y*r);\npair bottom=(C.x+(D.x-A.x),C.y+(D.y-A.y));\npair E=extension(D,bottom,B,C);\npair top=(E.x+D.x,E.y+D.y);\npair F=extension(E,top,A,C);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle^^D--E--F);\ndot(A^^B^^C^^D^^E^^F);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,W);\nlabel(\"$E$\",E,S);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,dir(0));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $\\overline{DE} \\parallel \\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{EF} \\parallel \\overline{AB},$ triangles $\\triangle BDE$ and $\\triangle EFC$ are similar to $\\triangle ABC$, and so they are also isosceles. That is, $BD = DE$ and $EF = FC.$\n\nThen the perimeter of $ADEF$ is \\[\\begin{aligned} AD + DE + EF + AF &= AD + BD + FC + AF \\\\ &= AB + AC \\\\ &= 25 + 25 \\\\ &= \\boxed{50}. \\end{aligned}\\]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Each vertex of this parallelogram has integer coordinates. The perimeter of this parallelogram is $p$ units, while the area is $a$ square units. What is the value of the sum $p + a$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(5cm,5cm);\ndraw((-2,0)--(11,0));\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,4)--(10,4)--(7,0)--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(3,4)$\",(3,4),NW);\nlabel(\"$(7,0)$\",(7,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the bottom side of the parallelogram is 7 units, and the length of the left side of the parallelogram is $\\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5$ units, by the Pythagorean theorem.  Since the opposite two sides are congruent to these two, the perimeter of the parallelogram is $5+7+5+7=24$ units.  The area of the parallelogram is equal to its base times its height, which is $(7)(4)=28$ square units.  Therefore, $p+a=24+28=\\boxed{52}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the smallest possible perimeter, in units, of a triangle whose side-length measures are consecutive integer values?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The smallest such triangle has lengths 1, 2, and 3. However, this triangle doesn't work since the sum of any two side lengths must be greater than the third side length (by the Triangle Inequality). The next smallest triangle has lengths 2, 3, and 4, which works. Thus, the smallest possible perimeter is $2+3+4=\\boxed{9}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is three times as long as a second  side, and the length of the third side is 15. What is the greatest possible perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $x$, $3x$, and 15. The Triangle Inequality implies that $3x<x+15$, so $x<7.5$. Because $x$ is an integer, the greatest possible perimeter is $7+21+15=\\boxed{43}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A scalene triangle has side lengths which are prime numbers and the  length of its perimeter is also prime. What is its smallest possible  perimeter?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The first few prime numbers are: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,\\ldots$.  Since the triangle is scalene, all the sides are different primes.\n\nIf one side is 2, then the other two sides must be odd.  Then the perimeter of the triangle would be even.  But the perimeter must also be greater than 2, so it cannot be prime.  This means that none of the sides can be 2.\n\nNow, suppose one side is 3.  Let the other two sides be $p$ and $q,$ where $p < q.$  Since all the sides are different,\n\\[3 < p < q.\\]Also, by the Triangle Inequality, $p + 3 > q,$ so\n\\[p > q - 3.\\]Since $p < q,$ the only possible values of $p$ are $q - 2$ and $q - 1.$\n\nSince $p$ is a prime greater than 3, $p$ is odd.  If $p = q - 1,$ then $q = p + 1$ is even, which means $q$ is not prime.  Therefore, $p = q - 2,$ or\n\\[q = p + 2.\\]As a number, $p$ must be of the form $3k,$ $3k + 1,$ or $3k + 2.$  Since $p$ is prime, $p$ cannot be of the form $3k.$  If $p = 3k + 1,$ then $q = p + 2 = 3k + 3 = 3(k + 1),$ which is not prime.  Therefore, $p = 3k + 2.$  Then $q = p + 2 = 3k + 4,$ and the perimeter of the triangle is\n\\[p + q + 3 = (3k + 2) + (3k + 4) + 3 = 6k + 9 = 3(2k + 3).\\]Since this is divisible by 3, the perimeter cannot be prime.  This tells us that none of the sides can be equal to 3 either.\n\nNote that $5 + 7 + 11 = 23$ is prime, so the smallest possible perimeter is $\\boxed{23}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 33 units and 42 units. The third side also has an integral length. What is the least possible number of units in the perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The sum of the smaller two sides must exceed the greatest side, so if $x$ is the missing side then $x+33>42\\implies x>9$.  The smallest integer greater than 9 is 10, so the least perimeter is $10+33+42=\\boxed{85}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two rectangles have integer dimensions, and both have a perimeter of 144 cm. What is the greatest possible difference between the areas of two such rectangles?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the dimensions of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$.  We are given $2l+2w=144$, which implies $l+w=72$.  Solving for $w$, we have $w=72-l$.  The area of the rectangle is $lw=l(72-l)$.  As a function of $l$, this expression is a parabola whose zeros are at $l=0$ and $l=72$ (see graph).  The $y$-coordinate of a point on the parabola is maximized when the $x$-coordinate is chosen as close to the $x$-coordinate of the vertex as possible.  The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the zeros at $x=(0+72)/2=36$, so the maximum area is $(36)(36)=1296$ square units.  Similarly, to minimize the area we choose the length to be as far from $36$ as possible.  The resulting dimensions are $1$ unit and $71$ units, so the minimum area is 71 square units.  The difference between 1296 square units and 71 square units is $\\boxed{1225}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nsize(150,IgnoreAspect);\nreal f(real x)\n{\n\nreturn x*(15-x);\n}\nxaxis(Arrows(4));\nyaxis(ymax=f(7.5),Arrows(4));\ndraw(graph(f,-3,18),Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"Area\",(0,f(7.5)),N);\nlabel(\"$l$\",(18,0),S);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has three different integer side lengths and a perimeter of 20 units. What is the maximum length of any one side?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A triangle with sides of 9,8 and 3 will satisfy these conditions.  This will have longest side of 9.  If the longest side has length 10, then the sum of the remaining two sides $x+y$ must be greater than 10 by the triangle inequality.  However, this cannot be since this will equal 10, and thus, the maximum length of one side is $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of the three sides of a triangle are $7$, $x+4$ and $2x+1$.  The perimeter of the triangle is 36.  What is the length of the longest side of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the perimeter of the triangle is 36, then $7+(x+4)+(2x+1)=36$ or $3x+12=36$ or $3x=24$ or $x=8$.\n\nThus, the lengths of the three sides of the triangle are $7$, $8+4=12$ and $2(8)+1=17$, of which the longest is $\\boxed{17}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two noncongruent integer-sided isosceles triangles have the same perimeter and the same area. The ratio of the lengths of the bases of the two triangles is $8: 7$. Find the minimum possible value of their common perimeter.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the first triangle have side lengths $a$, $a$, $14c$, and the second triangle have side lengths $b$, $b$, $16c$, where $a, b, 2c \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nEqual perimeter:\n$\\begin{array}{ccc} 2a+14c&=&2b+16c\\\\ a+7c&=&b+8c\\\\ c&=&a-b\\\\ \\end{array}$\nEqual Area:\n$\\begin{array}{cccl} 7c(\\sqrt{a^2-(7c)^2})&=&8c(\\sqrt{b^2-(8c)^2})&{}\\\\ 7(\\sqrt{(a+7c)(a-7c)})&=&8(\\sqrt{(b+8c)(b-8c)})&{}\\\\ 7(\\sqrt{(a-7c)})&=&8(\\sqrt{(b-8c)})&\\text{(Note that } a+7c=b+8c)\\\\ 49a-343c&=&64b-512c&{}\\\\ 49a+169c&=&64b&{}\\\\ 49a+169(a-b)&=&64b&\\text{(Note that } c=a-b)\\\\ 218a&=&233b&{}\\\\ \\end{array}$\nSince $a$ and $b$ are integer, the minimum occurs when $a=233$, $b=218$, and $c=15$. Hence, the perimeter is $2a+14c=2(233)+14(15)=\\boxed{676}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A parallelogram has three of its vertices at $(-1,0)$, $(2,4)$ and $(2,-4)$.  What is the positive difference between the greatest possible perimeter and the least possible perimeter of the parallelogram?\n\nAnswer:\n",
