    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a triangle, the area is numerically equal to the perimeter. What is the radius of the inscribed circle?\n$\\text{(A) } 2\\quad \\text{(B) } 3\\quad \\text{(C) } 4\\quad \\text{(D) } 5\\quad \\text{(E) } 6$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n One of the most common formulas involving the inradius of a triangle is $A = rs$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle, $r$ is the inradius, and $s$ is the semiperimeter.\nThe problem states that $A = p = 2s$. This means $2s = rs$, or $r = \\boxed{2}$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 5, AC=6, BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=9$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{9\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{3^3\\cdot 2^3} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{6}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{6} = r\\cdot 9,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = AC=7$ and $BC=6$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=10$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{10\\cdot 3\\cdot 3\\cdot 4} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 10,$$ which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{5}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $C$ has radius 6 cm. How many square centimeters are in the area of the largest possible inscribed triangle having one side as a diameter of circle $C$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We may consider the diameter of circle $C$ as the base of the inscribed triangle; its length is $12\\text{ cm}$. Then the corresponding height extends from some point on the diameter to some point on the circle $C$. The greatest possible height is a radius of $C$, achieved when the triangle is right isosceles: [asy]\nunitsize(8);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),6));\ndraw(((-6,0)--(6,0)));\nlabel(\"$12$\",(0,0),S);\ndraw(((-6,-0.6)--(-0.6,-0.6)),BeginArrow);\ndraw(((0.6,-0.6)--(6,-0.6)),EndArrow);\ndraw(((-6,0)--(0,6)));\ndraw(((0,6)--(6,0)));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,6)),dashed);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(0,2.5),E);\n[/asy] In this case, the height is $6\\text{ cm}$, so the area of the triangle is $$\\frac 12\\cdot 12\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{36}\\text{ square centimeters}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the diameter of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 11,$ $AC=6,$ and $BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $d$ be the diameter of the inscribed circle, and let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=12$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{12\\cdot 1\\cdot 6\\cdot 5} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{6^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 12,$$which yields the radius $r=\\frac {\\sqrt{10}}{2}$. This yields the diameter $d = \\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle with sides of 5, 12, and 13 has both an inscribed and a circumscribed circle.  What is the distance between the centers of those circles?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the triangle so that $AB = 5$, $AC = 12$, and $BC = 13$.  Let $I$ and $O$ be the incenter and circumcenter of triangle $ABC$, respectively.  Let the incircle of triangle $ABC$ be tangent to sides $BC$, $AC$, and $AB$ at $D$, $E$, and $F$, respectively.\n\n[asy]\nimport geometry;\n\nunitsize(0.4 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, I, O;\n\nA = (5^2/13,5*12/13);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (13,0);\nI = incenter(A,B,C);\nD = (I + reflect(B,C)*(I))/2;\nE = (I + reflect(C,A)*(I))/2;\nF = (I + reflect(A,B)*(I))/2;\nO = (B + C)/2;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(incircle(A,B,C));\ndraw(I--D);\ndraw(I--E);\ndraw(I--F);\ndraw(I--O);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\ndot(\"$D$\", D, S);\ndot(\"$E$\", E, NE);\ndot(\"$F$\", F, NW);\ndot(\"$I$\", I, N);\ndot(\"$O$\", O, S);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle BAC = 90^\\circ$, the circumcenter $O$ of triangle $ABC$ is the midpoint of hypotenuse $BC$.\n\nSince $AE$ and $AF$ are tangents from $A$ to the same circle, $AE = AF$.  Let $x = AE = AF$.  Similarly, let $y = BD = BF$ and $z = CD = CE$.  Then $x + y = AF + BF = AB = 5$, $x + z = AE + CE = AC = 12$, $y + z = BD + CD = BC = 13$.  Solving this system of equations, we find $x = 2$, $y = 3$, and $z = 10$.  Then $DO = BO - BD = BC/2 - y = 13/2 - 3 = 7/2$.\n\nThe inradius $r$ of triangle $ABC$ is given by $r = K/s$, where $K$ is the area of triangle $ABC$, and $s$ is the semi-perimeter.  We see that $K = [ABC] = 1/2 \\cdot AB \\cdot AC = 1/2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 12 = 30$, and $s = (AB + AC + BC)/2 = (5 + 12 + 13)/2 = 15$, so $r = 30/15 = 2$.\n\nHence, by the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $IDO$, \\[IO = \\sqrt{ID^2 + DO^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + \\left( \\frac{7}{2} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{65}{4}} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{2}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is inscribed in a circle of radius 3.  What is the area of the triangle? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$.  The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.  Thus $5x=2\\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$.  The area of the triangle is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3x\\cdot 4x =\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{18}{5}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}\n=\\frac{216}{25}=\\boxed{8.64}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle passes through the three vertices of an isosceles triangle that has two sides of length 3  and a base of length 2. What is the area of this circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $\\overline{BD}$ be an altitude of the isosceles $\\triangle ABC$, and let $O$ denote the center of the  circle with radius $r$ that passes through $A$, $B$, and $C$, as shown.\n\n[asy]\npair O,A,C,B,D;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-12,-16); C=(12,-16);\nD=(0,-16); B=(0,20);\ndraw(Circle(O,20),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(B--D,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(O--A,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$r$\",(0.6,10),W);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-5.3,-7.7),NW);\nlabel(\"1\",(-6,-16),N);\nlabel(\"3\",(-6,0),NW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(0,-15.7),S);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,E);\n[/asy]\n\nThen \\[\nBD = \\sqrt{3^2 - 1^2} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad OD = 2\\sqrt{2} - r.\n\\] Since $\\triangle ADO$ is a right triangle, we have \\[\nr^2 = 1^2 + \\left(2\\sqrt{2} - r\\right)^2 = 1 + 8 -4\\sqrt{2}r + r^2,\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad r = \\frac{9}{4\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{9}{8}\\sqrt{2}.\n\\] As a consequence, the circle has area \\[\n\\left( \\frac{9}{8}\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{81}{32}\\pi}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The number of inches in the perimeter of an equilateral triangle equals the number of square inches in the area of its circumscribed circle. What is the radius, in inches, of the circle? Express your answer in terms of pi and in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the triangle have vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, let $O$ be the center of the circle, and let $D$ be the midpoint of $\n\\overline{BC}$. Triangle $COD$ is a $30 - 60 - 90$ degree triangle. If $r$ is the radius of the circle, then the sides of $\\triangle COD$ are $r$, $\\frac{r}{2}$, and $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $6\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\displaystyle\\right)=3r\\sqrt{3}$, and the area of the circle is $\\pi r^{2}$. Thus $3r\\sqrt{3} = \\pi r^{2}$, and $r =\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{\\pi}}$.\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,D,O;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(0,1);\nB=(0.87,-0.5);\nC=(-0.87,-0.5);\nD=(0,-0.5);\ndraw(Circle(O,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(C--O--D--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$\\frac{r}{2}$\",(0,-0.25),E);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}$\",(-0.43,-0.5),S);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-0.43,-0.25),NW);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,N);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The congruent sides of an isosceles triangle are each 5 cm long, and the perimeter is 17 cm. In centimeters, what is the length of the base?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If the length of the base is $b$ centimeters, then the perimeter of the triangle is $5+5+b$ cm.  Solving $5+5+b=17$ we find $b=\\boxed{7}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles triangle with equal sides of 5 inches and a base of 6 inches is inscribed in a circle.
