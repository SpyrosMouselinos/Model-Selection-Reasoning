    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle with center $O$ has radius 25. Chord $\\overline{AB}$ of length 30 and chord $\\overline{CD}$ of length 14 intersect at point $P$. The distance between the midpoints of the two chords is 12. The quantity $OP^2$ can be represented as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $m + n$ is divided by 1000.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $E$ and $F$ be the midpoints of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, respectively, such that $\\overline{BE}$ intersects $\\overline{CF}$.\nSince $E$ and $F$ are midpoints, $BE = 15$ and $CF = 7$.\n$B$ and $C$ are located on the circumference of the circle, so $OB = OC = 25$.\nThe line through the midpoint of a chord of a circle and the center of that circle is perpendicular to that chord, so $\\triangle OEB$ and $\\triangle OFC$ are right triangles (with $\\angle OEB$ and $\\angle OFC$ being the right angles). By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OE = \\sqrt{25^2 - 15^2} = 20$, and $OF = \\sqrt{25^2 - 7^2} = 24$.\nLet $x$, $a$, and $b$ be lengths $OP$, $EP$, and $FP$, respectively. OEP and OFP are also right triangles, so $x^2 = a^2 + 20^2 \\to a^2 = x^2 - 400$, and $x^2 = b^2 + 24^2 \\to b^2 = x^2 - 576$\nWe are given that $EF$ has length 12, so, using the Law of Cosines with $\\triangle EPF$:\n$12^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos (\\angle EPF) = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \\cos (\\angle EPO + \\angle FPO)$\nSubstituting for $a$ and $b$, and applying the Cosine of Sum formula:\n$144 = (x^2 - 400) + (x^2 - 576) - 2 \\sqrt{x^2 - 400} \\sqrt{x^2 - 576} \\left( \\cos \\angle EPO \\cos \\angle FPO - \\sin \\angle EPO \\sin \\angle FPO \\right)$\n$\\angle EPO$ and $\\angle FPO$ are acute angles in right triangles, so substitute opposite/hypotenuse for sines and adjacent/hypotenuse for cosines:\n$144 = 2x^2 - 976 - 2 \\sqrt{(x^2 - 400)(x^2 - 576)} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 400}}{x} \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 - 576}}{x} - \\frac{20}{x} \\frac{24}{x} \\right)$\nCombine terms and multiply both sides by $x^2$: $144 x^2 = 2 x^4 - 976 x^2 - 2 (x^2 - 400) (x^2 - 576) + 960  \\sqrt{(x^2 - 400)(x^2 - 576)}$\nCombine terms again, and divide both sides by 64: $13 x^2 = 7200 - 15 \\sqrt{x^4 - 976 x^2 + 230400}$\nSquare both sides: $169 x^4 - 187000 x^2 + 51,840,000 = 225 x^4 - 219600 x^2 + 51,840,000$\nThis reduces to $x^2 = \\frac{4050}{7} = (OP)^2$; $4050 + 7 \\equiv \\boxed{57} \\pmod{1000}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Square $ABCD$ has center $O,\\ AB=900,\\ E$ and $F$ are on $AB$ with $AE<BF$ and $E$ between $A$ and $F, m\\angle EOF =45^\\circ,$ and $EF=400.$ Given that $BF=p+q\\sqrt{r},$ where $p,q,$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $p+q+r.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] size(200); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10)); pair A=(0,9), B=(9,9), C=(9,0), D=(0,0), E=(2.5-0.5*sqrt(7),9), F=(6.5-0.5*sqrt(7),9), G=(4.5,9), O=(4.5,4.5); draw(A--B--C--D--A);draw(E--O--F);draw(G--O); dot(A^^B^^C^^D^^E^^F^^G^^O); label(\"\\(A\\)\",A,(-1,1));label(\"\\(B\\)\",B,(1,1));label(\"\\(C\\)\",C,(1,-1));label(\"\\(D\\)\",D,(-1,-1)); label(\"\\(E\\)\",E,(0,1));label(\"\\(F\\)\",F,(1,1));label(\"\\(G\\)\",G,(-1,1));label(\"\\(O\\)\",O,(1,-1)); label(\"\\(x\\)\",E/2+G/2,(0,1));label(\"\\(y\\)\",G/2+F/2,(0,1)); label(\"\\(450\\)\",(O+G)/2,(-1,1));  [/asy]\nLet $G$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $O$ to $AB$. Denote $x = EG$ and $y = FG$, and $x > y$ (since $AE < BF$ and $AG = BG$). Then $\\tan \\angle EOG = \\frac{x}{450}$, and $\\tan \\angle FOG = \\frac{y}{450}$.\nBy the tangent addition rule $\\left( \\tan (a + b) = \\frac{\\tan a + \\tan b}{1 - \\tan a \\tan b} \\right)$, we see that\\[\\tan 45 = \\tan (EOG + FOG) = \\frac{\\frac{x}{450} + \\frac{y}{450}}{1 - \\frac{x}{450} \\cdot \\frac{y}{450}}.\\]Since $\\tan 45 = 1$, this simplifies to $1 - \\frac{xy}{450^2} = \\frac{x + y}{450}$. We know that $x + y = 400$, so we can substitute this to find that $1 - \\frac{xy}{450^2} = \\frac 89 \\Longrightarrow xy = 150^2$.\nSubstituting $x = 400 - y$ again, we know have $xy = (400 - y)y = 150^2$. This is a quadratic with roots $200 \\pm 50\\sqrt{7}$. Since $y < x$, use the smaller root, $200 - 50\\sqrt{7}$.\nNow, $BF = BG - FG = 450 - (200 - 50\\sqrt{7}) = 250 + 50\\sqrt{7}$. The answer is $250 + 50 + 7 = \\boxed{307}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Square $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle. Square $EFGH$ has vertices $E$ and $F$ on $\\overline{CD}$ and vertices $G$ and $H$ on the circle. If the area of square $ABCD$ is $1$, then the area of square $EFGH$ can be expressed as $\\frac {m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers and $m < n$. Find $10n + m$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $O$ be the center of the circle, and $2a$ be the side length of $ABCD$, $2b$ be the side length of $EFGH$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the radius of $\\odot O = OC = a\\sqrt{2}$.\n[asy] size(150); pointpen = black; pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pen d = linetype(\"4 4\") + blue + linewidth(0.7); pair C=(1,1), D=(1,-1), B=(-1,1), A=(-1,-1), E= (1, -0.2), F=(1, 0.2), G=(1.4, 0.2), H=(1.4, -0.2); D(MP(\"A\",A)--MP(\"B\",B,N)--MP(\"C\",C,N)--MP(\"D\",D)--cycle); D(MP(\"E\",E,SW)--MP(\"F\",F,NW)--MP(\"G\",G,NE)--MP(\"H\",H,SE)--cycle); D(CP(D(MP(\"O\",(0,0))), A));  D((0,0) -- (2^.5, 0), d); D((0,0) -- G -- (G.x,0), d);  [/asy]\nNow consider right triangle $OGI$, where $I$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{GH}$. Then, by the Pythagorean Theorem,\n\\begin{align*} OG^2 = 2a^2 &= OI^2 + GI^2 = (a+2b)^2 + b^2 \\\\ 0 &= a^2 - 4ab - 5b^2 = (a - 5b)(a + b) \\end{align*}\nThus $a = 5b$ (since lengths are positive, we discard the other root). The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths, so $\\frac{[EFGH]}{[ABCD]} = \\left(\\frac 15\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{25}$, and the answer is $10n + m = \\boxed{251}$.\nAnother way to proceed from $0 = a^2 - 4ab - 5b^2$ is to note that $\\frac{b}{a}$ is the quantity we need; thus, we divide by $a^2$ to get\n\\[0 = 1 - 4\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) - 5\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^2\\]This is a quadratic in $\\frac{b}{a}$, and solving it gives $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{5},-1$. The negative solution is extraneous, and so the ratio of the areas is $\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{25}$ and the answer is $10\\cdot 25 + 1 = \\boxed{251}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a circle of radius $42$, two chords of length $78$ intersect at a point whose distance from the center is $18$. The two chords divide the interior of the circle into four regions. Two of these regions are bordered by segments of unequal lengths, and the area of either of them can be expressed uniquely in the form $m\\pi-n\\sqrt{d},$ where $m, n,$ and $d$ are positive integers and $d$ is not divisible by the square of any prime number. Find $m+n+d.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the center of the circle be $O$, and the two chords be $\\overline{AB}, \\overline{CD}$ and intersecting at $E$, such that $AE = CE < BE = DE$. Let $F$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$. Then $\\overline{OF} \\perp \\overline{AB}$.\n[asy] size(200); pathpen = black + linewidth(0.7); pen d = dashed+linewidth(0.7); pair O = (0,0), E=(0,18), B=E+48*expi(11*pi/6), D=E+48*expi(7*pi/6), A=E+30*expi(5*pi/6), C=E+30*expi(pi/6), F=foot(O,B,A); D(CR(D(MP(\"O\",O)),42)); D(MP(\"A\",A,NW)--MP(\"B\",B,SE)); D(MP(\"C\",C,NE)--MP(\"D\",D,SW)); D(MP(\"E\",E,N)); D(C--B--O--E,d);D(O--D(MP(\"F\",F,NE)),d); MP(\"39\",(B+F)/2,NE);MP(\"30\",(C+E)/2,NW);MP(\"42\",(B+O)/2); [/asy]\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, $OF = \\sqrt{OB^2 - BF^2} = \\sqrt{42^2 - 39^2} = 9\\sqrt{3}$, and $EF = \\sqrt{OE^2 - OF^2} = 9$. Then $OEF$ is a $30-60-90$ right triangle, so $\\angle OEB = \\angle OED = 60^{\\circ}$. Thus $\\angle BEC = 60^{\\circ}$, and by the Law of Cosines,\n$BC^2 = BE^2 + CE^2 - 2 \\cdot BE \\cdot CE \\cos 60^{\\circ} = 42^2.$\nIt follows that $\\triangle BCO$ is an equilateral triangle, so $\\angle BOC = 60^{\\circ}$. The desired area can be broken up into two regions, $\\triangle BCE$ and the region bounded by $\\overline{BC}$ and minor arc $\\stackrel{\\frown}{BC}$. The former can be found by Heron's formula to be $[BCE] = \\sqrt{60(60-48)(60-42)(60-30)} = 360\\sqrt{3}$. The latter is the difference between the area of sector $BOC$ and the equilateral $\\triangle BOC$, or $\\frac{1}{6}\\pi (42)^2 - \\frac{42^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = 294\\pi - 441\\sqrt{3}$.\nThus, the desired area is $360\\sqrt{3} + 294\\pi - 441\\sqrt{3} = 294\\pi - 81\\sqrt{3}$, and $m+n+d = \\boxed{378}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circles $C_1$ and $C_2$ are externally tangent, and they are both internally tangent to circle $C_3.$ The radii of $C_1$ and $C_2$ are 4 and 10, respectively, and the centers of the three circles are all collinear. A chord of $C_3$ is also a common external tangent of $C_1$ and $C_2.$ Given that the length of the chord is $\\frac{m\\sqrt{n}}p$ where $m,n,$ and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $m+n+p.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] pointpen = black;  pathpen = black + linewidth(0.7);  size(200);  pair C1 = (-10,0), C2 = (4,0), C3 = (0,0), H = (-10-28/3,0), T = 58/7*expi(pi-acos(3/7));  path cir1 = CR(C1,4.01), cir2 = CR(C2,10), cir3 = CR(C3,14), t = H--T+2*(T-H); pair A = OP(cir3, t), B = IP(cir3, t), T1 = IP(cir1, t), T2 = IP(cir2, t);  draw(cir1); draw(cir2); draw(cir3);  draw((14,0)--(-14,0)); draw(A--B);  MP(\"H\",H,W); draw((-14,0)--H--A, linewidth(0.7) + linetype(\"4 4\"));  draw(MP(\"O_1\",C1));  draw(MP(\"O_2\",C2));  draw(MP(\"O_3\",C3));   draw(MP(\"T\",T,N));  draw(MP(\"A\",A,NW));  draw(MP(\"B\",B,NE));  draw(C1--MP(\"T_1\",T1,N));   draw(C2--MP(\"T_2\",T2,N));  draw(C3--T);  draw(rightanglemark(C3,T,H)); [/asy]\nLet $O_1, O_2, O_3$ be the centers and $r_1 = 4, r_2 = 10,r_3 = 14$ the radii of the circles $C_1, C_2, C_3$. Let $T_1, T_2$ be the points of tangency from the common external tangent of $C_1, C_2$, respectively, and let the extension of $\\overline{T_1T_2}$ intersect the extension of $\\overline{O_1O_2}$ at a point $H$. Let the endpoints of the chord/tangent be $A,B$, and the foot of the perpendicular from $O_3$ to $\\overline{AB}$ be $T$. From the similar right triangles $\\triangle HO_1T_1 \\sim \\triangle HO_2T_2 \\sim \\triangle HO_3T$,\n\\[\\frac{HO_1}{4} = \\frac{HO_1+14}{10} = \\frac{HO_1+10}{O_3T}.\\]\nIt follows that $HO_1 = \\frac{28}{3}$, and that $O_3T = \\frac{58}{7}$.

Let $A$ and $B$ be points on one of the semicircular arcs determined by $\\overline{MN}$ such that $A$ is the midpoint of the semicircle and $MB=\\frac{3}5$. Point $C$ lies on the other semicircular arc. Let $d$ be the length of the line segment whose endpoints are the intersections of diameter $\\overline{MN}$ with chords $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{BC}$. The largest possible value of $d$ can be written in the form $r-s\\sqrt{t}$, where $r, s$ and $t$ are positive integers and $t$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $r+s+t$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $V = \\overline{NM} \\cap \\overline{AC}$ and $W = \\overline{NM} \\cap \\overline{BC}$. Further more let $\\angle NMC = \\alpha$ and $\\angle MNC = 90^\\circ - \\alpha$. Angle chasing reveals $\\angle NBC = \\angle NAC = \\alpha$ and $\\angle MBC = \\angle MAC = 90^\\circ - \\alpha$. Additionally $NB = \\frac{4}{5}$ and $AN = AM$ by the Pythagorean Theorem.\nBy the Angle Bisector Formula,\\[\\frac{NV}{MV} = \\frac{\\sin (\\alpha)}{\\sin (90^\\circ - \\alpha)} = \\tan (\\alpha)\\]\\[\\frac{MW}{NW} = \\frac{3\\sin (90^\\circ - \\alpha)}{4\\sin (\\alpha)} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cot (\\alpha)\\]\nAs $NV + MV =MW + NW = 1$ we compute $NW = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{3}{4}\\cot(\\alpha)}$ and $MV = \\frac{1}{1+\\tan (\\alpha)}$, and finally $VW = NW + MV - 1 =  \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{3}{4}\\cot(\\alpha)} + \\frac{1}{1+\\tan (\\alpha)} - 1$. Taking the derivative of $VW$ with respect to $\\alpha$, we arrive at\\[VW' = \\frac{7\\cos^2 (\\alpha) - 4}{(\\sin(\\alpha) + \\cos(\\alpha))^2(4\\sin(\\alpha)+3\\cos(\\alpha))^2}\\]Clearly the maximum occurs when $\\alpha = \\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{7}}\\right)$. Plugging this back in, using the fact that $\\tan(\\cos^{-1}(x)) = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}$ and $\\cot(\\cos^{-1}(x)) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$, we get\n$VW = 7 - 4\\sqrt{3}$ with $7 + 4 + 3 = \\boxed{14}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = AC = 100$, and $BC = 56$.

Let the radius of $\\odot Q$ be $r$. We know that $PQ = r + 16$. From $Q$ draw segment $\\overline{QM} \\parallel \\overline{BC}$ such that $M$ is on $PX$. Clearly, $QM = XY$ and $PM = 16-r$. Also, we know $QPM$ is a right triangle.\nTo find $XC$, consider the right triangle $PCX$. Since $\\odot P$ is tangent to $\\overline{AC},\\overline{BC}$, then $PC$ bisects $\\angle ACB$. Let $\\angle ACB = 2\\theta$; then $\\angle PCX = \\angle QBX = \\theta$. Dropping the altitude from $A$ to $BC$, we recognize the $7 - 24 - 25$ right triangle, except scaled by $4$.\nSo we get that $\\tan(2\\theta) = 24/7$. From the half-angle identity, we find that $\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac {3}{4}$. Therefore, $XC = \\frac {64}{3}$. By similar reasoning in triangle $QBY$, we see that $BY = \\frac {4r}{3}$.\nWe conclude that $XY = 56 - \\frac {4r + 64}{3} = \\frac {104 - 4r}{3}$.\nSo our right triangle $QPM$ has sides $r + 16$, $r - 16$, and $\\frac {104 - 4r}{3}$.\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, simplification, and the quadratic formula, we can get $r = 44 - 6\\sqrt {35}$, for a final answer of $\\boxed{254}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle of radius $r$ has chords $\\overline{AB}$ of length $10$ and $\\overline{CD}$ of length 7.

Observing that $PD=2BP$ and that $\\angle BPD=60^{\\circ}$, we conclude that $BPD$ is a $30-60-90$ right triangle with right angle at $B$. Thus, $BD=8\\sqrt{3}$ and triangle $ABD$ is also right. Using that fact that the circumcircle of a right triangle has its diameter equal to the hypotenuse, we compute using the Pythagorean Theorem $AD=2r=2\\sqrt{73}$. From here we see that $r^2=\\boxed{73}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square and a circle intersect so that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The adjoining figure shows two intersecting chords in a circle, with $B$ on minor arc $AD$. Suppose that the radius of the circle is $5$, that $BC=6$, and that $AD$ is bisected by $BC$. Suppose further that $AD$ is the only chord starting at $A$ which is bisected by $BC$.

What is the criterion for this statement to be true?\nWe consider the locus of midpoints of the chords from $A$. It is well-known that this is the circle with diameter $AO$, where $O$ is the center of the circle. The proof is simple: every midpoint of a chord is a dilation of the endpoint with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and center $A$. Thus, the locus is the result of the dilation with scale factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and centre $A$ of circle $O$. Let the center of this circle be $P$.\nNow, $AD$ is bisected by $BC$ if they cross at some point $N$ on the circle. Moreover, since $AD$ is the only chord, $BC$ must be tangent to the circle $P$.\nThe rest of this problem is straightforward.\nOur goal is to find $\\sin \\angle AOB = \\sin{\\left(\\angle AOM - \\angle BOM\\right)}$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$. We have $BM=3$ and $OM=4$. Let $R$ be the projection of $A$ onto $OM$, and similarly let $Q$ be the projection of $P$ onto $OM$. Then it remains to find $AR$ so that we can use the addition formula for $\\sin$.\nAs $PN$ is a radius of circle $P$, $PN=2.5$, and similarly, $PO=2.5$. Since $OM=4$, we have $OQ=OM-QM=OM-PN=4-2.5=1.5$. Thus $PQ=\\sqrt{2.5^2-1.5^2}=2$.\nFurther, we see that $\\triangle OAR$ is a dilation of $\\triangle OPQ$ about center $O$ with scale factor $2$, so $AR=2PQ=4$.\nLastly, we apply the formula:\\[\\sin{\\left(\\angle AOM - \\angle BOM\\right)} = \\sin \\angle AOM \\cos \\angle BOM - \\sin \\angle BOM \\cos \\angle AOM = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)=\\frac{7}{25}\\]Thus the answer is $7\\cdot25=\\boxed{175}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A chord of a circle is perpendicular to a radius at the midpoint of the radius. The ratio of the area of the larger of the two regions into which the chord divides the circle to the smaller can be expressed in the form $\\displaystyle\n{{a\\pi+b\\sqrt{c}}\\over{d\\pi-e\\sqrt{f}}}$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, and $f$ are positive integers, $a$ and $e$ are relatively prime, and neither $c$ nor $f$ is divisible by the square of any prime.  Find the remainder when the product $a\\cdot\nb\\cdot c\\cdot d\\cdot e\\cdot f$ is divided by 1000.\n\nAnswer:\n",
