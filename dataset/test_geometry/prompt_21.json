    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A spherical soap bubble lands on a horizontal wet surface and forms a hemisphere of the same volume. Given the radius of the hemisphere is $3\\sqrt[3]{2}$ cm, find the radius of the original bubble.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac43\\pi r^3$, so the volume of a hemisphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac23\\pi r^3$. Therefore if a hemisphere of radius $r$ has the same volume as a sphere of radius $R$, we get $\\frac43\\pi R^3=\\frac23 \\pi r^3$. Simplifying gives $R^3=\\frac12 r^3\\Rightarrow R=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}r$. We know that $r=3\\sqrt[3]{2}$ and that $R$ is the quantity we want to solve for, so substituting in our value of $r$ gives $R=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\cdot 3\\sqrt[3]{2}=\\boxed{3}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot is filled full with chocolate.  All of the chocolate is then evenly distributed between 27 congruent, smaller hemisphere-shaped molds.  What is the radius of each of the smaller molds, in feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.  The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1^3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ cubic feet.\n\nLet each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$.  Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \\[27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A large sphere has a volume of $288\\pi$ cubic units.  A smaller sphere has a volume which is $12.5\\%$ of the volume of the larger sphere.  What is the ratio of the radius of the smaller sphere to the radius of the larger sphere? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that the two spheres are similar (in the same sense that triangles are similar) because corresponding parts are in proportion. We will prove that for two spheres that are similar in the ratio $1:k$, their volumes have the ratio $1:k^3$. Let the radius of the first sphere be $r$, so the radius of the other sphere is $kr$. The volume of the first sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the volume of the second sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (kr)^3$. The ratio between the two volumes is  \\[\\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (kr)^3}=\\frac{r^3}{k^3r^3}=\\frac{1}{k^3}\\] Thus, the ratio of the volumes of the two spheres is $1:k^3$.\n\nIn this problem, since the smaller sphere has $12.5\\%=\\frac{1}{8}$ of the volume of the larger sphere, the radius is $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{8}}=\\frac{1}{2}$ that of the larger sphere. Thus, the ratio between the two radii is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n(In general, the ratio of the volumes of two similar 3-D shapes is the cube of the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides.)\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n There are two concentric spheres of radii 3 units and 6 units. What is the volume, in cubic units, of the region within the larger sphere and not within the smaller sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The smaller one has volume $\\frac43\\cdot27\\pi=36\\pi$ cubic units and the larger one $\\frac43\\cdot216\\pi=288\\pi$ cubic units. The volume between them is the difference of their volumes, or $288\\pi-36\\pi=\\boxed{252\\pi}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube with edge length 9 inches. Then a smaller cube is inscribed in the sphere. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed cube? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We draw a diagram:\n\n[asy]\nsize(140);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndot((6,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nThe sphere's diameter length is equal to the big cube's side length, which is 9.\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),9));\ndraw((15,6)..(6,8)..(-3,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((15,6)..(6,4)..(-3,6));\ndot((6,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nNow the sphere's diameter is equal to the space diagonal of the small cube, meaning that the distance between two opposite corners of a cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere.  To compute the space diagonal of the cube, let the side length of the cube be $s$, and label points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ as shown below.\n\n[asy]\nsize(85);\npen dps=linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps);\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,0),SW); label(\"$C$\",(9,0),SE); label(\"$D$\",(12,3),NE); label(\"$A$\",(3,3),NW); label(\"$E$\",(12,12),E);\n[/asy] We look at triangle $\\triangle BDE$, where $\\overline{BE}$ is the space diagonal.  $\\overline{DE}$ is a side length of the cube with length $s$. $\\overline{BD}$ is the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with legs length $s$, so its length is $\\sqrt{s^2+s^2}=s\\sqrt{2}$.  So we have \\[BE=\\sqrt{DE^2+BD^2}=\\sqrt{s^2+(s\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{3s^2} = s\\sqrt{3}.\\]Thus, the space diagonal of a cube with side length $s$ has length $s\\sqrt{3}$.  The sphere has diameter 9, which is equal to the space diagonal of the cube, so we have \\[9 = s\\sqrt{3} \\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad s = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]Finally, the volume of the cube is $s^3 = \\left(\\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{81\\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube, and the cube has a surface area of 24 square meters. A second cube is then inscribed within the sphere. What is the surface area in square meters of the inner cube?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the surface area of the original cube is 24 square meters, each face of the cube has a surface area of $24/6 = 4$ square meters, and the side length of this cube is 2  meters. The sphere inscribed within the cube has diameter 2 meters,  which is also the length of the diagonal of the cube inscribed in the sphere. Let $l$ represent the side length of the inscribed cube. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice gives \\[\nl^2 + l^2 + l^2 = 2^2 = 4.\n\\]Hence each face has surface area \\[\nl^2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\ \\text{square meters}.\n\\]So the surface area of the inscribed cube is $6\\cdot (4/3) = \\boxed{8}$ square meters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The truncated right circular cone has a large base radius 8 cm and a small base radius of 4 cm. The height of the truncated cone is 6 cm. How many $\\text{cm}^3$ are in the volume of this solid?  [asy]\n\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\n\ndraw(ellipse((0,0),4,1)); draw(ellipse((0,3),2,1/2));\n\ndraw((-3.97,.1)--(-1.97,3.1)^^(3.97,.1)--(1.97,3.1));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\ndraw(ellipse((0,0),4,1)); draw(ellipse((0,3),2,1/2),gray(.7));\n// draw((-3.97,.1)--(-1.97,3.1)^^(3.97,.1)--(1.97,3.1));\ndraw((-3.97,.1)--(0,6.07)--(3.97,.1));\n\ndraw((4,0)--(0,0)--(0,6.07),linewidth(0.8));\ndraw((2,3)--(0,3),linewidth(0.8));\nlabel(\"4\",(2,3)--(0,3),S);\nlabel(\"8\",(4,0)--(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"6\",(0,0)--(0,3),W);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(0,2)--(0,6.07),W);\n[/asy]\n\nWe \"complete\" the truncated cone by adding a smaller, similar cone atop the cut, forming a large cone.  We don't know the height of the small cone, so call it $x$.  Since the small and large cone are similar, we have $x/4=(x+6)/8$; solving yields $x=6$.  Hence the small cone has radius 4, height 6, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(4^2)(6)=32\\pi$ and the large cone has radius 8, height 12, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(8^2)(12)=256\\pi$.  The frustum's volume is the difference of these two volumes, or $256\\pi-32\\pi=\\boxed{224\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. Given that one edge of the cube is 6 inches, how many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(70);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy] A sphere inscribed in a cube has diameter length equal to the side length of the cube.  Thus, the inscribed sphere has diameter 6 inches, radius $6/2=3$ inches, and volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3)^3=4\\cdot 3^2\\pi=\\boxed{36\\pi}\\] cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Twenty-seven solid gold spherical beads each of radius 3 are melted down and recast into a larger, solid gold sphere.
