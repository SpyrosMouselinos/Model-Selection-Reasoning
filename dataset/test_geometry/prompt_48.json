    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle passes through the three vertices of an isosceles triangle that has two sides of length 3  and a base of length 2. What is the area of this circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $\\overline{BD}$ be an altitude of the isosceles $\\triangle ABC$, and let $O$ denote the center of the  circle with radius $r$ that passes through $A$, $B$, and $C$, as shown.\n\n[asy]\npair O,A,C,B,D;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-12,-16); C=(12,-16);\nD=(0,-16); B=(0,20);\ndraw(Circle(O,20),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(B--D,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(O--A,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$r$\",(0.6,10),W);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-5.3,-7.7),NW);\nlabel(\"1\",(-6,-16),N);\nlabel(\"3\",(-6,0),NW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(0,-15.7),S);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,E);\n[/asy]\n\nThen \\[\nBD = \\sqrt{3^2 - 1^2} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad OD = 2\\sqrt{2} - r.\n\\] Since $\\triangle ADO$ is a right triangle, we have \\[\nr^2 = 1^2 + \\left(2\\sqrt{2} - r\\right)^2 = 1 + 8 -4\\sqrt{2}r + r^2,\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad r = \\frac{9}{4\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{9}{8}\\sqrt{2}.\n\\] As a consequence, the circle has area \\[\n\\left( \\frac{9}{8}\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{81}{32}\\pi}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $A(1, 1), B(6, 1), C(3, 7)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that $AB$ has length 5 and is parallel to the $x$-axis. Therefore, the height of the triangle is the difference in the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$, or $7-1 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = \\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a triangle, the area is numerically equal to the perimeter. What is the radius of the inscribed circle?\n$\\text{(A) } 2\\quad \\text{(B) } 3\\quad \\text{(C) } 4\\quad \\text{(D) } 5\\quad \\text{(E) } 6$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n One of the most common formulas involving the inradius of a triangle is $A = rs$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle, $r$ is the inradius, and $s$ is the semiperimeter.\nThe problem states that $A = p = 2s$. This means $2s = rs$, or $r = \\boxed{2}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle is inscribed in a circle. The vertices of the triangle divide the circle into three arcs of lengths 3, 4, and 5. What is the area of the triangle?\n$\\mathrm{(A) \\ 6 } \\qquad \\mathrm{(B) \\frac{18}{\\pi^2} } \\qquad \\mathrm{(C) \\frac{9}{\\pi^2}(\\sqrt{3}-1) } \\qquad \\mathrm{(D) \\frac{9}{\\pi^2}(\\sqrt{3}-1) } \\qquad \\mathrm{(E) \\frac{9}{\\pi^2}(\\sqrt{3}+3) }$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The three arcs make up the entire circle, so the circumference of the circle is $3+4+5=12$ and the radius is $\\frac{12}{2\\pi}=\\frac{6}{\\pi}$. Also, the lengths of the arcs are proportional to their corresponding central angles. Thus, we can write the values of the arcs as $3\\theta$, $4\\theta$, and $5\\theta$ for some $\\theta$. By Circle Angle Sum, we obtain $3\\theta+4\\theta+5\\theta=360$. Solving yields $\\theta=30$. Thus, the angles of the triangle are $90$, $120$, and $150$. Using $[ABC]=\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin{C}$, we obtain $\\frac{r^2}{2}(\\sin{90}+\\sin{120}+\\sin{150})$. Substituting $\\frac{6}{\\pi}$ for $r$ and evaluating yields $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{\\pi^2}(\\sqrt{3}+3)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $C$ has radius 6 cm. How many square centimeters are in the area of the largest possible inscribed triangle having one side as a diameter of circle $C$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We may consider the diameter of circle $C$ as the base of the inscribed triangle; its length is $12\\text{ cm}$. Then the corresponding height extends from some point on the diameter to some point on the circle $C$. The greatest possible height is a radius of $C$, achieved when the triangle is right isosceles: [asy]\nunitsize(8);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),6));\ndraw(((-6,0)--(6,0)));\nlabel(\"$12$\",(0,0),S);\ndraw(((-6,-0.6)--(-0.6,-0.6)),BeginArrow);\ndraw(((0.6,-0.6)--(6,-0.6)),EndArrow);\ndraw(((-6,0)--(0,6)));\ndraw(((0,6)--(6,0)));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,6)),dashed);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(0,2.5),E);\n[/asy] In this case, the height is $6\\text{ cm}$, so the area of the triangle is $$\\frac 12\\cdot 12\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{36}\\text{ square centimeters}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is inscribed in a circle of radius 3.  What is the area of the triangle? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$.  The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.  Thus $5x=2\\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$.  The area of the triangle is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3x\\cdot 4x =\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{18}{5}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}\n=\\frac{216}{25}=\\boxed{8.64}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices at $A(5,8)$, $B(3,-2)$, and $C(6,1)$. The point $D$ with coordinates $(m,n)$ is chosen inside the triangle so that the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$ and $BCD$ all have equal areas. What is the value of $10m + n$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, then $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ would all have equal areas (to see this, remember that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into 6 equal areas). There is only one point with this property (if we move around $D$, the area of one of the small triangles will increase and will no longer be $1/3$ of the total area). So $D$ must be the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the centroid are found by averaging the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the vertices, so $(m,n) = \\left( \\frac{5+3+6}{3}, \\frac{8+(-2)+1}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$, and $10m + n = 10 \\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) + \\frac{7}{3} = \\boxed{49}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $ABC$ be a  triangle with $\\angle BAC = 90^\\circ$.  A circle is tangent to the sides $AB$ and $AC$ at $X$ and $Y$ respectively, such that the points on the circle diametrically opposite $X$ and $Y$ both lie on the side $BC$.  Given that $AB = 6$, find the area of the portion of the circle that lies outside the triangle.\n\n[asy]\nimport olympiad;\nimport math;\nimport graph;\n\nunitsize(4cm);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = A + right;\npair C = A + up;\n\npair O = (1/3, 1/3);\n\npair Xprime = (1/3,2/3);\npair Yprime = (2/3,1/3);\n\nfill(Arc(O,1/3,0,90)--Xprime--Yprime--cycle,0.7*white);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(Circle(O, 1/3));\ndraw((0,1/3)--(2/3,1/3));\ndraw((1/3,0)--(1/3,2/3));\n\ndraw((1/16,0)--(1/16,1/16)--(0,1/16));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B, down);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C, left);\nlabel(\"$X$\",(1/3,0), down);\nlabel(\"$Y$\",(0,1/3), left);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $O$ be the center of the circle, and $r$ its radius, and let $X'$ and $Y'$ be the points diametrically opposite $X$ and $Y$, respectively. We have $OX' = OY' = r$, and $\\angle X'OY' = 90^\\circ$. Since triangles $X'OY'$ and $BAC$ are similar, we see that $AB = AC$. Let $X''$ be the foot of the altitude from $Y'$ to $\\overline{AB}$. Since $X''BY'$ is similar to $ABC$, and $X''Y' = r$, we have $X''B = r$. It follows that $AB = 3r$, so $r = 2$.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport olympiad;\nimport math;\nimport graph;\n\nunitsize(4cm);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = A + right;\npair C = A + up;\n\npair O = (1/3, 1/3);\n\npair Xprime = (1/3,2/3);\npair Yprime = (2/3,1/3);\n\nfill(Arc(O,1/3,0,90)--Xprime--Yprime--cycle,0.7*white);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(Circle(O, 1/3));\ndraw((0,1/3)--(2/3,1/3));\ndraw((1/3,0)--(1/3,2/3));\n\ndraw((2/3, 0)--(2/3, 1/3));\ndraw((1/16,0)--(1/16,1/16)--(0,1/16));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B, down);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C, left);\nlabel(\"$X$\",(1/3,0), down);\nlabel(\"$Y$\",(0,1/3), left);\nlabel(\"$X'$\", (1/3, 2/3), NE);\nlabel(\"$Y'$\", (2/3, 1/3), NE);\nlabel(\"$X''$\", (2/3, 0), down);\nlabel(\"$O$\", O, NE);\n\n[/asy]\n\nThen, the desired area is the area of the quarter circle minus that of the triangle $X'OY'$. And the answer is $\\frac 1 4 \\pi r^2 - \\frac 1 2 r^2 = \\boxed{\\pi - 2}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An equilateral triangle has sides 8 units long. An equilateral triangle with sides 4 units long is cut off at the top, leaving an isosceles trapezoid. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the trapezoid? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect the midpoints of the sides of the equilateral triangle as shown.  The triangle is divided into four congruent equilateral triangles, and the isosceles trapezoid is made up of 3 of these 4 triangles.  Therefore, the ratio of the area of one of the triangles to the area of the trapezoid is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(12mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=3;\n\ndraw((0,0)--dir(0)--2*dir(0)--dir(60)+(1,0)--dir(60)--cycle);\n\ndraw(dir(60)+(1,0)--dir(0)--dir(60)--2*dir(60)--cycle);\n\ndot((0,0));\ndot(2*dir(0));\ndot(2*dir(60));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Six points are equally spaced around a circle of radius 1.
