    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid is formed on a $6\\times 8$ rectangular base. The four edges joining the apex to the corners of the rectangular base each have length $13$. What is the volume of the pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know the rectangular base of the pyramid has area $48$. To find the volume, we must also determine the height.\n\nLet the rectangular base be $ABCD$. Let the apex of the pyramid be $X$, and let $O$ be the foot of the perpendicular drawn from $X$ to face $ABCD$: [asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport three;\ntriple A = (-3,-4,0);\ntriple B = (-3,4,0);\ntriple C = (3,4,0);\ntriple D = (3,-4,0);\ntriple O = (0,0,0);\ntriple X = (0,0,12);\ndraw(B--C--D--A--B--X--D);\ndraw(X--C); draw(A--X--O--D,dashed);\ndot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(O); dot(X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,W);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,ESE);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,N);\ndraw(O+(X-O)/19.2--O+(X-O)/19.2+(D-O)/8--O+(D-O)/8);\n[/asy] Then by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\begin{align*}\n13^2 &= OX^2+OA^2 = OX^2+OB^2 \\\\\n&= OX^2+OC^2 = OX^2+OD^2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $OA=OB=OC=OD$, so $O$ must be the center of the rectangle (where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet). This is also the point where the diagonals of $ABCD$ bisect each other. Each diagonal of $ABCD$ has length $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$, so we have $OA=OB=OC=OD=5$.\n\nThus $OX=\\sqrt{13^2-OD^2} = \\sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$, and so the height of the pyramid is $12$. The volume is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac 13\\cdot (\\text{area of base})\\cdot (\\text{height}) &= \\frac 13\\cdot 48\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= 16\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{192}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In tetrahedron $ABCD$, edge $AB$ has length 3 cm. The area of face $ABC$ is $15\\mbox{cm}^2$ and the area of face $ABD$ is $12 \\mbox { cm}^2$. These two faces meet each other at a $30^\\circ$ angle. Find the volume of the tetrahedron in $\\mbox{cm}^3$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n It is clear that $DX=8$ and $CX=10$ where $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ and $C$ to side $AB$. Thus $[DXC]=\\frac{ab\\sin{c}}{2}=20=5 \\cdot h \\rightarrow h = 4$ where h is the height of the tetrahedron from $D$. Hence, the volume of the tetrahedron is $\\frac{bh}{3}=15\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid with a square base has total surface area 432 square units.  The area of each triangular face is half the area of the square face. What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $ABCD$ be the base of the pyramid and let $P$ be the pyramid's apex.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport three;\n\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\n\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\n\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\n\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\n\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\n\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\n\ndraw(P--C);\n\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\n\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\n\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\n\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\n\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\n\ndraw(P--F--M,dashed);\n\ndraw(P--M);\n\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\n\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,SW);\n\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base and $M$ be the midpoint of an edge of the square, as shown.  There are four triangular faces, each with area half the area of the square face.  So, the total surface area of the pyramid is 3 times the area of the square face.  Therefore, the area of the square face is $432/3=144$ square units, which means that each side of the square has length 12.\n\nSince the area of the triangle is half the area of the square, we have $(BC)(PM)/2 = 72$, so $(BC)(PM) = 144$, which means $PM = 144/12 = 12$.  Since $F$ is the center of the square base, we have $FM = 6$, so $PF = \\sqrt{12^2 - 6^2} = 6\\sqrt{3}$.  Finally, the volume of the pyramid is \\[\\frac{[ABCD]\\cdot PF}{3} = \\frac{144\\cdot 6\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\boxed{288\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a regular tetrahedron the centers of the four faces are the vertices of a smaller tetrahedron. The ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to that of the larger is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Embed the tetrahedron in 4-space to make calculations easier. Its vertices are $(1,0,0,0)$, $(0,1,0,0)$, $(0,0,1,0)$, $(0,0,0,1)$.\nTo get the center of any face, we take the average of the three coordinates of that face. The vertices of the center of the faces are: $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, 0)$,$(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3},0, \\frac{1}{3})$,$(\\frac{1}{3},0, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$,$(0,\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\nThe side length of the large tetrahedron is $\\sqrt{2}$ by the distance formula. The side length of the smaller tetrahedron is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$ by the distance formula.\nTheir ratio is $1:3$, so the ratio of their volumes is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}$.\n$m+n = 1 + 27 = \\boxed{28}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Faces $ABC$ and $BCD$ of tetrahedron $ABCD$ meet at an angle of $30^\\circ$. The area of face $ABC$ is $120$, the area of face $BCD$ is $80$, and $BC=10$. Find the volume of the tetrahedron.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the area $BCD=80=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10\\cdot16$, the perpendicular from $D$ to $BC$ has length $16$.\nThe perpendicular from $D$ to $ABC$ is $16 \\cdot \\sin 30^\\circ=8$. Therefore, the volume is $\\frac{8\\cdot120}{3}=\\boxed{320}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has side length $6$. Its vertices are alternately colored black and purple, as shown below. What is the volume of the tetrahedron whose corners are the purple vertices of the cube? (A tetrahedron is a pyramid with a triangular base.)\n\n[asy]\nimport three;\nreal t=-0.05;\ntriple A,B,C,D,EE,F,G,H;\nA = (0,0,0);\nB = (cos(t),sin(t),0);\nD= (-sin(t),cos(t),0);\nC = B+D;\nEE = (0,0,1);\nF = B+EE;\nG = C + EE;\nH = D + EE;\ndraw(surface(B--EE--G--cycle),rgb(.6,.3,.6),nolight);\ndraw(surface(B--D--G--cycle),rgb(.7,.4,.7),nolight);\ndraw(surface(D--EE--G--cycle),rgb(.8,.5,.8),nolight);\ndraw(B--C--D);\ndraw(EE--F--G--H--EE);\ndraw(B--F);\ndraw(C--G);\ndraw(D--H);\npen pu=rgb(.5,.2,.5)+8; pen bk=black+8;\ndot(B,pu); dot(C,bk); dot(D,pu); dot(EE,pu); dot(F,bk); dot(G,pu); dot(H,bk);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of any pyramid is $\\frac 13$ the product of the base area and the height. However, determining the height of the purple tetrahedron is somewhat tricky! Instead of doing that, we observe that the total volume of the cube consists of the purple tetrahedron and four other \"clear\" tetrahedra. Each clear tetrahedron is formed by one of the black vertices of the cube together with its three purple neighbors. The clear tetrahedra are convenient to work with because they have lots of right angles.\n\nEach clear tetrahedron has an isosceles right triangular base of area $\\frac 12\\cdot 6\\cdot 6 = 18$, with corresponding height $6$ (a side of the cube). Thus, each clear tetrahedron has volume $\\frac 13\\cdot 18\\cdot 6 = 36$.\n\nThe cube has volume $6^3 = 216$. The volume of the purple tetrahedron is equal to the volume of the cube minus the volume of the four clear tetrahedra. This is $216 - 4\\cdot 36 = \\boxed{72}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube with an edge length of 4 units has the same volume as a square-based pyramid with base edge lengths of 8 units and a height of $h$ units. What is the value of $h$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cube has volume $4^3=64$.  The pyramid has volume $\\frac{1}{3}8^2h$.  So\n\n$$64=\\frac{64}{3}h\\Rightarrow h=\\boxed{3}$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square pyramid has a base edge of 32 inches and an altitude of 1 foot. A square pyramid whose altitude is one-fourth of the original altitude is cut away at the apex of the original pyramid. The volume of the remaining frustum is what fractional part of the volume of the original pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid.  The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/4, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/4)^3 = 1/64$ of the volume of the original pyramid.  Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/64) = \\boxed{\\frac{63}{64}}$ of the original pyramid.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of one lateral face of a right pyramid with an equilateral triangular base is 75 square meters. If the slant height is 30 meters, what is the length of the side of its base, in meters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $s$ represent the sidelength of the equilateral triangular base. Each face of the pyramid has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}bh=75$, where $b$ is the sidelength of the base and $h$ is the slant height of 30 meters. We have  $$75=\\frac{1}{2}s(30)=15s.$$So, $s=5$ and the sidelength of the base is $\\boxed{5}$ meters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the total area, in square units, of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid that has base edges measuring 6 units and lateral edges measuring 5 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The triangular faces are isosceles triangles.  We drop an altitude from the apex to the base, and, since the triangle is isosceles, it will also be a median.  So it forms a right triangle with hypotenuse $5$ and one leg $3$, and thus the other leg, the altitude, is $4$.  The area of the triangle is then $\\frac{4(6)}{2}=12$.  Since there are $4$ triangular faces, the total area is $4(12)=\\boxed{48}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular tetrahedron is a pyramid with four faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle.\n\nLet $V$ be the volume of a regular tetrahedron whose sides each have length $1$. What is the exact value of $V^2$ ?\n\nAnswer:\n",
