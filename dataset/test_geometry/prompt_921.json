    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two cylindrical cans have the same volume. The height of one can is triple the height of the other. If the radius of the narrower can is 12 units, how many units are in the length of the radius of the wider can? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the wide can be $h$ and the height of the narrow can be $3h$.  Let the wide can have radius $x$ units.  Since the two volumes are equal, we have \\[\\pi (12^2) (3h) = \\pi (x^2) (h).\\] Solving yields $x = 12\\sqrt{3}$ so the wide can has radius $\\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Either increasing the radius or the height of a cylinder by six inches will result in the same volume. The original height of the cylinder is two inches. What is the original radius in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the original radius be $r$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased radius is $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased height is $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Since we are told these two volumes are the same, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2 = \\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Simplifying, we have $(r+6)^2=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2+12r+36=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2-4r-12=0$. Factoring, we have $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=\\boxed{6}$ (it cannot be negative because it is a physical length).\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has a surface area of 216 square centimeters. What is the volume of the cube, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are 6 faces to a cube, meaning that each face has area 36, and the edge has length 6, for a total volume of $6^3 = \\boxed{216}$ for the cube.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume, in cubic inches, of a rectangular box, whose faces have areas of $24$ square inches, $16$ square inches and $6$ square inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular box, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=24$, $wh=16$, and $lh=6$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=24\\cdot16\\cdot6=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot2^4\\cdot2\\cdot3=2^8\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^4\\cdot3=\\boxed{48}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right, rectangular prism has three faces with areas of $6,8$ and $12$ square inches. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=6$, $wh=8$, and $lh=12$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=6\\cdot8\\cdot12=3\\cdot2\\cdot2^3\\cdot2^2\\cdot3=2^6\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^3\\cdot3=\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone having a diameter of 10cm and a height of 6cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The radius of the base of the cone is $10/2 = 5$, so the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{50 \\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangular prism has dimensions 8 inches by 2 inches by 32 inches. If a cube has the same volume as the prism, what is the surface area of the cube, in square inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cube has volume $8\\cdot2\\cdot32$ cubic inches, so its edge length is $\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot2\\cdot32}=\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot64}=\\sqrt[3]{8}\\sqrt[3]{64}=2\\cdot4=8$ inches.  The surface area of a cube with edge length 8 inches is $6(8\\text{ in.})^2=\\boxed{384}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cones with radius 12 cm and height 12 cm are enclosed within a cylinder. The base of each cone is a base of the cylinder, and the height of the cylinder is 24 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cylinder not occupied by the cones? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylinder has volume $\\pi (12)^2 (24)$ cubic cm.  Each cone has volume $(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12)$ cubic cm.  Hence the volume of the space in the cylinder not occupied by the cones is  \\begin{align*}\n\\pi (12)^2 (24) - (2)(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12) &= 12^3\\pi(2-2/3)\\\\\n&=12^3\\pi(4/3)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{2304\\pi} \\text{ cubic cm}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The number of cubic inches in the volume of a 6-inch high cylindrical can equals the number of square inches in the area of the label that covers the lateral surface of the can. In inches, what is the radius of the can?\n\nAnswer:\n",
