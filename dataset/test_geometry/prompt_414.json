    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cylinder formed by rotating a square with side length 14 centimeters about its vertical line of symmetry. Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(100);\ndraw((-5,-.2)--(-3,-.2)--(-3,1.8)--(-5,1.8)--cycle); label(\"14\",((-3,1.8)--(-5,1.8)),N); label(\"14\",((-5,-.2)--(-5,1.8)),W);\ndraw((-2.5,.9)--(-1.5,.9),EndArrow);\nimport solids; import three; currentprojection = orthographic(5,0,2);\nrevolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), 1, 2);\ndraw((0,-1,2)--(0,1,2)); label(\"14\",((0,-1,2)--(0,1,2)),N); label(\"14\",(0,1,1),E);\ndraw(c,black);\n[/asy]\n\nRotating the square about its vertical line of symmetry creates a right circular cylinder with diameter 14 and height 14.  Thus, the cylinder has radius $14/2=7$ and volume $\\pi(7^2)(14)=\\pi(50-1)(14)=\\pi(700-14)=\\boxed{686\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is three times as long as a second  side, and the length of the third side is 15. What is the greatest possible perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $x$, $3x$, and 15. The Triangle Inequality implies that $3x<x+15$, so $x<7.5$. Because $x$ is an integer, the greatest possible perimeter is $7+21+15=\\boxed{43}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When a right triangle is rotated about one leg, the volume of the cone produced is $800\\pi \\;\\textrm{ cm}^3$. When the triangle is rotated about the other leg, the volume of the cone produced is $1920\\pi \\;\\textrm{ cm}^3$. What is the length (in cm) of the hypotenuse of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let one leg of the triangle have length $a$ and let the other leg have length $b$. When we rotate around the leg of length $a$, the result is a cone of height $a$ and radius $b$, and so of volume $\\frac 13 \\pi ab^2 = 800\\pi$. Likewise, when we rotate around the leg of length $b$ we get a cone of height $b$ and radius $a$ and so of volume $\\frac13 \\pi b a^2 = 1920 \\pi$. If we divide this equation by the previous one, we get $\\frac ab = \\frac{\\frac13 \\pi b a^2}{\\frac 13 \\pi ab^2} = \\frac{1920}{800} = \\frac{12}{5}$, so $a = \\frac{12}{5}b$. Then $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{12}{5}b\\right)b^2 = 800\\pi$ so $b^3 = 1000$ and $b = 10$ so $a = 24$. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse has length $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\boxed{26}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The slant height of a cone is 13 cm, and the height from the vertex to the center of the base is 12 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cone? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We create a right triangle with the slant height as the hypotenuse, the height from the vertex to the center of the base as one of the legs, and a radius as the other leg.  By Pythagorean theorem, the radius measures $\\sqrt{13^2-12^2}=5$ cm.  It follows that the volume of the cone is $(1/3)\\pi(5^2)(12)=\\boxed{100\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A round pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick and has a diameter of 12 inches. It is cut into 12 congruent pieces. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one piece? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The entire pizza has radius 6 inches and volume $\\pi (6^2)(1/3) = 12\\pi$ cubic inches.  One slice has 1/12th this volume, or $\\boxed{\\pi}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The shaded region shown consists of 11 unit squares and rests along the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis. The shaded region is rotated about the $x$-axis to form a solid. In cubic units, what is the volume of the resulting solid? Express your answer in simplest form in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nfill((0,0)--(0,5)--(1,5)--(1,2)--(4,2)--(4,0)--cycle, gray(.8));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,5)--(1,5)--(1,2)--(4,2)--(4,0)--cycle);\ndraw((0,1)--(4,1));\ndraw((0,2)--(1,2));\ndraw((0,3)--(1,3));\ndraw((0,4)--(1,4));\ndraw((1,0)--(1,2));\ndraw((2,0)--(2,2));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,2));\n\ndraw((4,0)--(5,0),EndArrow(4));\ndraw((0,0)--(-2,0),EndArrow(4));\nlabel(\"$x$\", (5,0), E);\n\ndraw((0,5)--(0,6),EndArrow(4));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,-1),EndArrow(4));\nlabel(\"$y$\", (0,6), N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The resulting solid is the union of two cylinders: one whose radius is 5 units and whose height is 1 unit (the squares shown in light gray produce this cylinder), and the other whose radius is 2 units and whose height is 3 units (shown in dark gray).  The sum of these volumes is $\\pi(5)^2(1)+\\pi(2)^2(3)=\\boxed{37\\pi}$ cubic units.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nfill((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,5)--(0,5)--cycle, gray(.8));\nfill((1,0)--(4,0)--(4,2)--(1,2)--cycle, gray(0.4));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,5)--(1,5)--(1,2)--(4,2)--(4,0)--cycle);\ndraw((0,1)--(4,1));\ndraw((0,2)--(1,2));\ndraw((0,3)--(1,3));\ndraw((0,4)--(1,4));\ndraw((1,0)--(1,2));\ndraw((2,0)--(2,2));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,2));\ndraw((4,0)--(5,0),EndArrow(4));\ndraw((0,0)--(-2,0),EndArrow(4));\nlabel(\"$x$\", (5,0), E);\ndraw((0,5)--(0,6),EndArrow(4));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,-1),EndArrow(4));\nlabel(\"$y$\", (0,6), N);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In tetrahedron $ABCD$, edge $AB$ has length 3 cm. The area of face $ABC$ is $15\\mbox{cm}^2$ and the area of face $ABD$ is $12 \\mbox { cm}^2$. These two faces meet each other at a $30^\\circ$ angle. Find the volume of the tetrahedron in $\\mbox{cm}^3$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n It is clear that $DX=8$ and $CX=10$ where $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ and $C$ to side $AB$. Thus $[DXC]=\\frac{ab\\sin{c}}{2}=20=5 \\cdot h \\rightarrow h = 4$ where h is the height of the tetrahedron from $D$. Hence, the volume of the tetrahedron is $\\frac{bh}{3}=15\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. Given that one edge of the cube is 6 inches, how many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(70);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy] A sphere inscribed in a cube has diameter length equal to the side length of the cube.  Thus, the inscribed sphere has diameter 6 inches, radius $6/2=3$ inches, and volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3)^3=4\\cdot 3^2\\pi=\\boxed{36\\pi}\\] cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Right $\\Delta ABC$ has legs measuring 8 cm and 15 cm.
