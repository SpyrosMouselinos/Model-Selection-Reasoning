    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Cylinder $B$'s height is equal to the radius of cylinder $A$ and cylinder $B$'s radius is equal to the height $h$ of cylinder $A$. If the volume of cylinder $A$ is twice the volume of cylinder $B$, the volume of cylinder $A$ can be written as $N \\pi h^3$ cubic units. What is the value of $N$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(4cm,4cm);\npath a=(0,-1.2)..(-10,0)--(10,0)..cycle;\npath b=(17,-0.9)..(13,0)--(21,0)..cycle;\npath c=(0,1.2)..(-10,0)--(10,0)..cycle;\npath d=(17,0.9)..(13,0)--(21,0)..cycle;\ndraw(c);\ndraw(d);\ndraw(shift((0,7))*a);\ndraw(shift((0,7))*c);\ndraw(shift((0,15))*b);\ndraw(shift((0,15))*d);\ndraw((-10,0)--(-10,7));\ndraw((10,0)--(10,7));\ndraw((13,0)--(13,15));\ndraw((21,0)--(21,15));\ndraw(a);\ndraw(b);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,9),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(17,18),N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, let us denote the radius of cylinder A (and height of cylinder B) as $r$, and the height of cylinder A (and radius of cylinder B) as $h$.  Therefore, if the volume of cylinder A is double that of B, then: $\\frac{\\text{Volume of Cylinder A}}{\\text{Volume of Cylinder B}} = \\frac{r^2 \\cdot h}{h^2 \\cdot r} = \\frac{r}{h} = 2$.  Therefore, normally the volume of Cylinder A is expressed as $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot h$, and plugging in $r = 2h$, we see that the volume of Cylinder A $= 4\\pi \\cdot h^3$, hence $N = \\boxed{4}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the cylinder. Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nimport solids; size(150); import three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); currentprojection = orthographic(5,0,3);\nrevolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), 1, 3);\nrevolution c2 = cone((0,0,0), 1,1.5);\ndraw(c,black);\ndraw(c2,black);\n\ndraw((1.5,0)--(1.5,2.5),Arrows(TeXHead));\nlabel(\"12\",(1.5,0)--(1.5,2.5),E);\ndraw((-1.5,0)--(-1.5,1.25),Arrows(TeXHead));\nlabel(\"6\",(-1.5,0)--(-1.5,1.25),W);\n\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0),Arrows(TeXHead));\nlabel(\"4\",(0,0)--(1,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is $(1/3) \\pi r^2 h$; the volume of a cylinder with similar dimensions is $\\pi r^2 h$.  The cone has the same radius as the cylinder and half the height, so it has $1/3$ the volume of half the cylinder and thus has $1/2\\cdot 1/3 = 1/6$ the volume of the whole cylinder.  Hence the desired ratio is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cylinder has a height of $10$ and a radius of $3.$ Determine the total surface area, including the two ends, of the cylinder. [asy]\ndraw(ellipse((5,0),5,2),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw(ellipse((5,10),5,2),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((1,8.95)--(5,10),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,10),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((10,0)--(10,10),black+linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"3\",(1,8.95)--(5,10),NW);\nlabel(\"10\",(0,0)--(0,10),W);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To calculate the total surface area of the cylinder, we cut off the two ends to obtain two circles of radius $3.$\n\n[asy]\ndraw(circle((3,3),3),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((3,3)--(5.1213,3-2.1213),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw(circle((11,3),3),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((11,3)--(13.1213,3-2.1213),black+linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"3\",(3,3)--(5.1213,3-2.1213),SW);\nlabel(\"3\",(11,3)--(13.1213,3-2.1213),SW);\n[/asy]\n\nThe two ends combined have an area of $$2\\pi r^2 = 2 \\pi(3^2)=18\\pi.$$ Next, we must calculate the lateral surface area. To do this, we make a vertical cut through this area, and unroll the lateral surface. When we do this, we obtain a rectangle with height $10.$ The width of the rectangle (ie. the length of the top edge) is equal to the circumference of one of the ends, since the top edge of this rectangle lay exactly along the circumference of the top end.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(15,0)--(15,10)--(0,10)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"10\",(0,0)--(0,10),W);\n[/asy]\n\nThe circumference of one of the ends is $$2\\pi r = 2\\pi(3)=6\\pi,$$ so the width of the rectangle is $6\\pi.$ Therefore, the area of this rectangle is $10\\times 6\\pi = 60\\pi.$ So the total surface area of the cylinder is $18\\pi + 60\\pi = \\boxed{78\\pi}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The cube below has sides of length 4 feet. If a cylindrical section of radius 2 feet is removed from the solid, what is the total remaining volume of the cube? Express your answer in cubic feet in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nimport solids; size(150); import three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); currentprojection = orthographic(4,2.5,3);\n\ndraw((1,-1,0)--(1,1,0)--(-1,1,0)); draw((-1,1,0)--(-1,-1,0)--(1,-1,0), dashed);\ndraw((1,-1,2)--(1,1,2)--(-1,1,2)--(-1,-1,2)--cycle);\ndraw((1,-1,0)--(1,-1,2)); draw((1,1,0)--(1,1,2)); draw((-1,-1,0)--(-1,-1,2),dashed); draw((-1,1,0)--(-1,1,2));revolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), 1, 2);\ndraw(c,black);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cube has volume $4^3=64$ cubic feet.  The cylinder has radius 2, height 4, and volume $\\pi(2^2)(4)=16\\pi$ cubic feet.  It follows that when the cylindrical section is removed from the solid, the remaining volume is $\\boxed{64-16\\pi}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a cylinder is $54\\pi$ $\\text{cm}^3$. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone with the same radius and height as the cylinder? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$. [asy]\nimport solids; currentprojection=orthographic(0,100,25); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nrevolution cyl = cylinder((5,0,0),1,5,Z);\nrevolution cone = cone((0,0,0),1,5,Z);\ndraw(cyl,backpen=dashed);\ndraw(cone,backpen=dashed);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $(1/3)\\pi r^2 h$; a cylinder with the same radius and height has volume $\\pi r^2 h$.  Thus we see the volume of the corresponding cone has 1/3 the volume of the cylinder, which is $(1/3)(54\\pi = \\boxed{18\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone is inscribed in a right prism as shown. What is the ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the prism? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$. [asy]\nimport three; import graph3;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nsize(200);\ndraw((0,0,0)--(1,0,0)--(1,1,0)--(0,1,0)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0,1)--(1,0,1)--(1,1,1)--(0,1,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0,0)--(0,0,1)); draw((1,0,0)--(1,0,1)); draw((1,1,0)--(1,1,1)); draw((0,1,0)--(0,1,1));\ndraw(Circle((0.5,0.5,0),0.5),dashed);\ndraw((0.5,0.5,1)--(0.5,0,0),dashed); draw((0.5,0.5,1)--(0.5,1,0),dashed); draw((0.5,0.5,1)--(1,0.5,0),dashed); draw((0.5,0.5,1)--(0,0.5,0),dashed);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the cone is tangent to all sides of the base of the prism, the base of the prism is a square.  Furthermore, if the radius of the base of the cone is $r$, then the side length of the square is $2r$.\n\nLet $h$ be the common height of the cone and the prism.  Then the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h,\\] and the volume of the prism is $(2r)^2 h = 4r^2 h$, so the desired ratio is \\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h}{4r^2 h} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{12}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The shaded region shown consists of 11 unit squares and rests along the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis. The shaded region is rotated about the $x$-axis to form a solid. In cubic units, what is the volume of the resulting solid?

The sum of these volumes is $\\pi(5)^2(1)+\\pi(2)^2(3)=\\boxed{37\\pi}$ cubic units.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nfill((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,5)--(0,5)--cycle, gray(.8));\nfill((1,0)--(4,0)--(4,2)--(1,2)--cycle, gray(0.4));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,5)--(1,5)--(1,2)--(4,2)--(4,0)--cycle);\ndraw((0,1)--(4,1));\ndraw((0,2)--(1,2));\ndraw((0,3)--(1,3));\ndraw((0,4)--(1,4));\ndraw((1,0)--(1,2));\ndraw((2,0)--(2,2));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,2));\ndraw((4,0)--(5,0),EndArrow(4));\ndraw((0,0)--(-2,0),EndArrow(4));\nlabel(\"$x$\", (5,0), E);\ndraw((0,5)--(0,6),EndArrow(4));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,-1),EndArrow(4));\nlabel(\"$y$\", (0,6), N);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circles of radius 2 and 3 are externally tangent and are circumscribed by a third circle, as shown in the figure.

So the area of the stripe is $3(80)=\\boxed{240}$ square feet.\n\nNotice that neither the diameter of the cylinder nor the number of times the stripe wrapped around the cylinder factored into our computation for the area of the stripe. At first, this may sound counter-intuitive. An area of 240 square feet is what we would expect for a perfectly rectangular stripe that went straight up the side of the cylinder.\n\nHowever, note that no matter how many times the stripe is wrapped around the cylinder, its base and height (which are perpendicular) are always preserved. So, the area remains the same. Consider the following stripes which have been \"unwound\" from a cylinder with height 80 feet.\n\n[asy]\nsize(400);\nreal s=8;\npair A=(0,0), B=(1.5,0), C=(1.5,20), D=(0,20);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\nlabel(\"$3$\", (C+D)/2, N);\nlabel(\"$80$\", (A+D)/2, W);\n\ndraw(shift(s)*(shift(20)*A--shift(20)*B--C--D--cycle));\nlabel(\"$3$\", shift(s)*((C+D)/2), N);\ndraw(shift(s)*((0,0)--D), dashed);\nlabel(\"$80$\", shift(s)*(((0,0)+D)/2), W);\n\ndraw(shift(4.5s)*(shift(40)*A--shift(40)*B--C--D--cycle));\nlabel(\"$3$\", shift(4.5s)*((C+D)/2), N);\ndraw(shift(4.5s)*((0,0)--D), dashed);\nlabel(\"$80$\", shift(4.5s)*(((0,0)+D)/2), W);\n[/asy]\n\nRegardless of how many times the stripes were wrapped around the cylinder, each stripe has base 3 feet and height 80 feet, giving area 240 sq ft.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The water tank in the diagram below is in the shape of an inverted right circular cone. The radius of its base is 16 feet, and its height is 96 feet. The water in the tank is $25\\%$ of the tank's capacity.  The height of the water in the tank can be written in the form $a\\sqrt[3]{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by a perfect cube greater than 1.  What is $a+b$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8pt)+fontsize(8pt));\n\ndraw(shift(0,96)*yscale(0.5)*Circle((0,0),16));\ndraw((-16,96)--(0,0)--(16,96)--(0,96));\n\ndraw(scale(0.75)*shift(0,96)*yscale(0.5)*Circle((0,0),16));\n\ndraw((-18,72)--(-20,72)--(-20,0)--(-18,0));\nlabel(\"water's height\",(-20,36),W);\n\ndraw((20,96)--(22,96)--(22,0)--(20,0));\nlabel(\"96'\",(22,48),E);\n\nlabel(\"16'\",(8,96),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The water in the tank fills a cone, which we will refer to as the water cone, that is similar to the cone-shaped tank itself.  Let the scale factor between the water cone and tank be $x$, so the height of the water cone is $96x$ feet and the radius of the water cone is $16x$ feet.  It follows that the volume of the water cone is $(1/3)\\pi(16x)^2(96x)$ cubic feet.\n\nThe volume of the cone-shaped tank is $(1/3)\\pi(16^2)(96)$.  Since the water cone has $25\\%$ or 1/4 of the volume of the tank, we have  \\[(1/3)\\pi(16x)^2(96x) = (1/4) (1/3)\\pi(16^2)(96).\\]  Simplifying yields $x^3 = 1/4$, so $x = \\sqrt[3]{1/4}$.\n\nFinally, the height of the water in the tank is the height of the water cone, which is  \\[96x=96\\sqrt[3]{1/4}=48\\cdot 2\\sqrt[3]{1/4}=48\\sqrt[3]{(1/4)(8)}={48\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\] feet.  Therefore, we have $a+b=48+2 = \\boxed{50}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of the cylinder shown is $45\\pi$ cubic cm. What is the height in centimeters of the cylinder?
