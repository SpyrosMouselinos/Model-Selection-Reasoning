    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$, the parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths of 8 and 20 units, respectively, and the altitude is 12 units. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. What is the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ in square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$. Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$ the lengths of the bases $AB$ and $CD$ are 8 and 17 respectively. The legs of the trapezoid are extended beyond $A$ and $B$ to meet at point $E$. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $EAB$ to the area of trapezoid $ABCD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\npair A,B,C,D,F;\nA = (0,0);\nB = (8,0);\nD = (-4,7);\nC = (13,7);\nF = intersectionpoint(D -- (A + 3*(A-D)), C -- (B + 3*(B-C)));\ndraw(A--F--C--D--A--B);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$E$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,NE);\n[/asy]\n\nTriangles $EAB$ and $EDC$ are similar, and the ratio of their corresponding sides is $\\frac{CD}{AB} = \\frac{17}{8}$. Therefore, we have \\[\\frac{[EDC]}{[EAB]} = \\left(\\frac{17}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{289}{64}.\\]  Since $[EDC] = [EAB] + [ABCD]$, we have $\\frac{[ABCD] + [EAB]}{[EAB]} = \\frac{289}{64}$, so \\[\\frac{[ABCD]}{[EAB]} + 1 = \\frac{289}{64}.\\] Therefore, $\\frac{[ABCD]}{[EAB]} = \\frac{225}{64}$, so $\\frac{[EAB]}{[ABCD]} = \\boxed{\\frac{64}{225}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n On square $ABCD$, point $E$ lies on side $AD$ and point $F$ lies on side $BC$, so that $BE=EF=FD=30$. Find the area of the square $ABCD$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Drawing the square and examining the given lengths,[asy] size(2inch, 2inch); currentpen = fontsize(8pt); pair A = (0, 0); dot(A); label(\"$A$\", A, plain.SW); pair B = (3, 0); dot(B); label(\"$B$\", B, plain.SE); pair C = (3, 3); dot(C); label(\"$C$\", C, plain.NE); pair D = (0, 3); dot(D); label(\"$D$\", D, plain.NW); pair E = (0, 1); dot(E); label(\"$E$\", E, plain.W); pair F = (3, 2); dot(F); label(\"$F$\", F, plain.E); label(\"$\\frac x3$\", E--A); label(\"$\\frac x3$\", F--C); label(\"$x$\", A--B); label(\"$x$\", C--D); label(\"$\\frac {2x}3$\", B--F); label(\"$\\frac {2x}3$\", D--E); label(\"$30$\", B--E); label(\"$30$\", F--E); label(\"$30$\", F--D); draw(B--C--D--F--E--B--A--D); [/asy]you find that the three segments cut the square into three equal horizontal sections. Therefore, ($x$ being the side length), $\\sqrt{x^2+(x/3)^2}=30$, or $x^2+(x/3)^2=900$. Solving for $x$, we get $x=9\\sqrt{10}$, and $x^2=810.$\nArea of the square is $\\boxed{810}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of centimeters in the length of $EF$ if $AB\\parallel CD\\parallel EF$?\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(4cm,4cm);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F,X;\n\nA=(0,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,0);\nX=(0,0);\nD=(1/3)*C+(2/3)*X;\n\ndraw (A--B--C--D);\ndraw(D--B);\ndraw(A--C);\n\nE=(0.6,0.4);\nF=(1,0.4);\n\ndraw(E--F);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,SW);\nlabel(\"$E$\",shift(-0.1,0)*E);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,E);\n\nlabel(\"$100$ cm\",midpoint(C--D),S);\nlabel(\"$150$ cm\",midpoint(A--B),N);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $AB\\parallel EF,$ we know that $\\angle BAC = \\angle FEC$ and $\\angle ABC = \\angle EFC.$ Therefore, we see that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle EFC$ by AA Similarity. Likewise, $\\triangle BDC \\sim \\triangle BEF.$\n\nFrom our similarities, we can come up with two equations: $\\dfrac{BF}{BC} = \\dfrac{EF}{DC}$ and $\\dfrac{FC}{BC} = \\dfrac{EF}{AB}.$\n\nSince we have $AB$ and $DC$ and we want to find $EF,$ we want all the other quantities to disappear. Since $BF + FC = BC,$ we try adding our two equations: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{BF}{BC} + \\frac{FC}{BC} &= \\frac{EF}{DC} + \\frac{EF}{AB}.\\\\\n\\frac{BC}{BC} = 1 &= EF\\left(\\frac{1}{DC} + \\frac{1}{AB}\\right)\\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{DC} + \\frac{1}{AB}} &= EF\n\\end{align*} Now we plug in $DC = 100\\text{ cm}$ and $AB = 150\\text{ cm},$ giving us $EF = \\boxed{60}\\text{ cm}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $AB$ parallel to $CD$, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. If the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, what is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(2.5inch);\npair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (-3,4);\nB = (5,4);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (0,0);\nE = intersectionpoint(A--C, B--D);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$E$\", E, N);\n[/asy] We will write the area of triangle $XYZ$ as $[XYZ].$  Since triangles $ADC$ and $BCD$ share a base and have the same altitude length to that base, they have the same area. Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$. Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$. Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \\boxed{98}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $AHI$ is equilateral.

Since $\\bigtriangleup AFG$ takes up $\\frac{9}{16}$ of the area of $\\bigtriangleup AHI$, trapezoid $FGIH$ takes up the other $\\frac{7}{16}$ of the area.  More formally,  \\begin{align*}\n[AFG]+[FGIH]&=[AHI] \\implies \\\\\n\\frac{[AFG]}{[AHI]}+\\frac{[FGIH]}{[AHI]}&=1 \\implies \\\\\n\\frac{[FGIH]}{[AHI]}&=1- \\frac{[AFG]}{[AHI]} \\\\\n&=1-\\frac{9}{16} \\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{16}}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $ABCD$ be an isosceles trapezoid with $\\overline{AD}||\\overline{BC}$ whose angle at the longer base $\\overline{AD}$ is $\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$. The diagonals have length $10\\sqrt {21}$, and point $E$ is at distances $10\\sqrt {7}$ and $30\\sqrt {7}$ from vertices $A$ and $D$, respectively. Let $F$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$ to $\\overline{AD}$. The distance $EF$ can be expressed in the form $m\\sqrt {n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] size(300); defaultpen(1); pair A=(0,0), D=(4,0), B= A+2 expi(1/3*pi), C= D+2expi(2/3*pi), E=(-4/3,0), F=(3,0); draw(F--C--B--A); draw(E--A--D--C); draw(A--C,dashed); draw(circle(A,abs(C-A)),dotted); label(\"\\(A\\)\",A,S); label(\"\\(B\\)\",B,NW); label(\"\\(C\\)\",C,NE); label(\"\\(D\\)\",D,SE); label(\"\\(E\\)\",E,N); label(\"\\(F\\)\",F,S); clip(currentpicture,(-1.5,-1)--(5,-1)--(5,3)--(-1.5,3)--cycle); [/asy]\nAssuming that $ADE$ is a triangle and applying the triangle inequality, we see that $AD > 20\\sqrt {7}$. However, if $AD$ is strictly greater than $20\\sqrt {7}$, then the circle with radius $10\\sqrt {21}$ and center $A$ does not touch $DC$, which implies that $AC > 10\\sqrt {21}$, a contradiction. As a result, A, D, and E are collinear. Therefore, $AD = 20\\sqrt {7}$.\nThus, $ADC$ and $ACF$ are $30-60-90$ triangles. Hence $AF = 15\\sqrt {7}$, and\n$EF = EA + AF = 10\\sqrt {7} + 15\\sqrt {7} = 25\\sqrt {7}$\nFinally, the answer is $25+7=\\boxed{32}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $ABCD$ is a trapezoid with the measure of base $\\overline{AB}$ twice the measure of the base $\\overline{CD}$.

Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(200);\npair p1,p2,p3,p4;\np1 = (0,0); p2 = (2.5, 4); p3 = (7.5,4); p4 = (10,0);\n\ndraw(p1--p2--p3--p4--cycle);\ndraw(p1--p3); draw(p2--p4);\nlabel(\"$A$\", p1, SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\", p2, NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", p3, NE);\nlabel(\"$B$\", p4, SE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", (5,2.5) , S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the bases of the trapezoid are $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, these two line segments must be parallel. Now, since $\\overline{AC}$ intersects these two parallel lines, $\\angle DCE$ and $\\angle BAE$ are alternate interior angles and therefore must be congruent. Similarly, $\\overline{DB}$ intersects the bases, so $\\angle CDE$ and $\\angle ABE$ are congruent. We have two pairs of congruent angles, so $\\triangle DCE \\sim \\triangle BAE$ by the Angle-Angle Similarity Theorem.\n\nSides of similar triangles are proportional, so since the lengths of sides $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are related in a $2:1$ proportion, we also have that $EA/EC=2/1$, so the length of $\\overline{EC}$ must be $1/3$ that of $\\overline{AC}$. Since $\\overline{AC}$ has length $11$, $\\overline{EC}$ must have length $\\dfrac{1}{3} \\cdot 11 = \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the trapezoid shown, the ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $ADC$ is $7:3$. If $AB + CD = 210$ cm, how long is segment $\\overline{AB}$? [asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\npair A = (0,0), B = (5,0), C = (3,2), D = (1,2);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle--C);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW); label(\"$B$\",B,SE); label(\"$C$\",C,NE); label(\"$D$\",D,NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $h$ be the height of the trapezoid.  The height of the trapezoid is also a height of $ABC$ and of $ADC$.  Specifically, we have $[ABC] = (AB)(h)/2$ and $[ADC] = (CD)(h)/2$, so $[ABC]:[ADC] = AB:CD$.  Since we are given that this area ratio equals $7:3$, we know that $AB:CD = 7:3$.  Therefore, $AB = 7x$ and $CD = 3x$ for some  value of $x$.  Since $AB + CD = 210$ cm, we have $7x+3x=210$, so $10x=210$ and $x=21$. Therefore,  $AB=7 \\times 21 = \\boxed{147\\text{ cm}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $ABCD$ is a rectangular sheet of paper. $E$ and $F$ are points on $AB$ and $CD$ respectively such that $BE < CF$. If $BCFE$ is folded over $EF$, $C$ maps to $C'$ on $AD$ and $B$ maps to $B'$ such that $\\angle{AB'C'} \\cong \\angle{B'EA}$. If $AB' = 5$ and $BE = 23$, then the area of $ABCD$ can be expressed as $a + b\\sqrt{c}$ square units, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are integers and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Compute $a + b + c$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $\\angle{AB'C'} = \\theta$. By some angle chasing in $\\triangle{AB'E}$, we find that $\\angle{EAB'} = 90^{\\circ} - 2 \\theta$. Before we apply the law of sines, we're going to want to get everything in terms of $\\sin \\theta$, so note that $\\sin \\angle{EAB'} = \\sin(90^{\\circ} - 2 \\theta) = \\cos 2 \\theta = 1 - 2 \\sin^2 \\theta$. Now, we use law of sines, which gives us the following:\n$\\frac{\\sin \\theta}{5}=\\frac{1 - 2 \\sin^2 \\theta}{23} \\implies \\sin \\theta = \\frac{-23 \\pm 27}{20}$, but since $\\theta < 180^{\\circ}$, we go with the positive solution. Thus, $\\sin \\theta = \\frac15$.\nDenote the intersection of $B'C'$ and $AE$ with $G$. By another application of the law of sines, $B'G = \\frac{23}{\\sqrt{24}}$ and $AE = 10\\sqrt{6}$. Since $\\sin \\theta = \\frac15, GE = \\frac{115}{\\sqrt{24}}$, and $AG = AE - GE = 10\\sqrt{6} - \\frac{115}{\\sqrt{24}} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{24}}$. Note that $\\triangle{EB'G} \\sim \\triangle{C'AG}$, so $\\frac{EG}{B'G}=\\frac{C'G}{AG} \\implies C'G = \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{24}}$.\nNow we have that $AB = AE + EB = 10\\sqrt{6} + 23$, and $B'C' = BC = B'G + C'G = \\frac{23}{\\sqrt{24}} + \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{24}} = \\frac{48}{\\sqrt{24}}=4\\sqrt{6}$. Thus, the area of $ABCD$ is $(10\\sqrt{6} + 23)(4\\sqrt{6}) = 92\\sqrt{6} + 240$, and our final answer is $92 + 6 + 240 = \\boxed{338}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$, $\\overline{AB}$ is parallel to $\\overline{CD}$, $AB = 7$ units, and $CD = 10$ units.
