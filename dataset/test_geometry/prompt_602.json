    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A fly is on the edge of a ceiling of a circular room with a radius of 58 feet. The fly walks straight across the ceiling to the opposite edge, passing through the center of the circle. It then walks straight to another point on the edge of the circle but not back through the center. The third part of the journey is straight back to the original starting point. If the third part of the journey was 80 feet long, how many total feet did the fly travel over the course of all three parts?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The fly's journey traces out the three sides of triangle.  Because one side of this triangle is a diameter of the circular ceiling and the other two sides are chords of this circle, the triangle is a right triangle. If the radius of the circular room is 58 feet, then the diameter is $2 \\times 58 = 116$ feet. This is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. One of the legs is 80 feet, so the other leg must be equal to $\\sqrt{116^2 - 80^2} = \\sqrt{(13{,}456 - 6400)} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84$ feet. The total distance traveled by the fly is $116 + 84 + 80 = \\boxed{280}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n On an old-fashioned bicycle the front wheel has a radius of $2.5$ feet and the back wheel has a radius of $4$ inches.  If there is no slippage, how many revolutions will the back wheel make while the front wheel makes $100$ revolutions?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The circumference of the front wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot 2.5=5\\pi$ feet. In 100 revolutions, the front wheel travels $5\\pi \\cdot 100 = 500\\pi$ feet. The back wheel must travel the same distance because they are both attached to the same bike. The circumference of the back wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ feet (note that 4 inches is equal to $\\frac{1}{3}$ feet). Thus, the number of revolutions of the back wheel is $\\frac{500\\pi}{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi}=\\boxed{750}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The second hand on the clock pictured below is 6 cm long.  How far in centimeters does the tip of this second hand travel during a period of 30 minutes? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),20));\nlabel(\"12\",(0,20),S);\nlabel(\"9\",(-20,0),E);\nlabel(\"6\",(0,-20),N);\nlabel(\"3\",(20,0),W);\ndot((0,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(12,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(-8,10));\ndraw((0,0)--(-11,-14),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"6cm\",(-5.5,-7),SE);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In 30 minutes, the tip of the second hand travels 30 times around the circumference of a circle of radius 6cm. Since the circumference is $2\\pi \\cdot6 = 12\\pi$, the tip of the second hand travels $12\\pi \\cdot 30 = \\boxed{360\\pi}$ centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A car travels due east at $\\frac 23$ mile per minute on a long, straight road. At the same time, a circular storm, whose radius is $51$ miles, moves southeast at $\\frac 12\\sqrt{2}$ mile per minute. At time $t=0$, the center of the storm is $110$ miles due north of the car. At time $t=t_1$ minutes, the car enters the storm circle, and at time $t=t_2$ minutes, the car leaves the storm circle. Find $\\frac 12(t_1+t_2)$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We set up a coordinate system, with the starting point of the car at the origin. At time $t$, the car is at $\\left(\\frac 23t,0\\right)$ and the center of the storm is at $\\left(\\frac{t}{2}, 110 - \\frac{t}{2}\\right)$. Using the distance formula,\n\\begin{eqnarray*} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{2}{3}t - \\frac 12t\\right)^2 + \\left(110-\\frac{t}{2}\\right)^2} &\\le& 51\\\\ \\frac{t^2}{36} + \\frac{t^2}{4} - 110t + 110^2 &\\le& 51^2\\\\ \\frac{5}{18}t^2 - 110t + 110^2 - 51^2 &\\le& 0\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}\nNoting that $\\frac 12(t_1+t_2)$ is at the maximum point of the parabola, we can use $-\\frac{b}{2a} = \\frac{110}{2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{18}} = \\boxed{198}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of degrees in the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n[asy]\nsize(200);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),5),linewidth(1.2));\npair[] mins;\nfor(int i = 0; i < 60; ++i){\n\nmins[i] = 4.5*dir(-6*i + 90);\n\ndot(mins[i]);\n}\nfor(int i = 1; i <= 12; ++i){\n\nlabel((string)i,mins[5*i % 60],dir(-30*i - 90));\n}\n\nfill(Circle((0,0),0.25));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Six boys stood equally spaced on a circle of radius 40 feet. Each boy walked to all of the other non-adjacent persons on the circle, shook their hands and then returned to his original spot on the circle before the next boy started his trip to shake hands with all of the other non-adjacent boys on the circle. After all six boys had done this, what is the least distance in feet that could have been traveled? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The thicker solid line in the diagram shows the shortest path that one person could travel. The circle is equally divided into six 60-degree arcs, so the short distance is 40 feet, the same as a radius. The dotted line is a diameter that separates the quadrilateral into two 30-60-90 triangles. The longer leg is $(80\\sqrt {3})/2$, or $40\\sqrt{3}$ feet. Each person travels $40\\sqrt{3} + 40 + 40 + 40\\sqrt{3} = 80 + 80\\sqrt{3}$ feet. After all six people did this, $6(80 + 80\\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{480 + 480\\sqrt{3}\\text{ feet}}$ had been traveled.

The area of the rectangle is twice the area of the circle. What is the length of the longer side of the rectangle, in centimeters? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(30,0)--(30,20)--(0,20)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((10,10),10));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If the circle has radius 4, its area is $16\\pi$. Thus, the area of the rectangle is $32\\pi$.\n\nThe length of the shorter side of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the circle, so it is 8 centimeters long. This means that the length of the other side is $32\\pi/8 = \\boxed{4\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, angle $ACB$ is 50 degrees, and angle $CBA$ is 70 degrees.  Let $D$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $BC$, $O$ the center of the circle circumscribed about triangle $ABC$, and $E$ the other end of the diameter which goes through $A$.  Find the angle $DAE$, in degrees.\n\n[asy]\n\nunitsize(1.5 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, O;\n\nA = dir(90);\n\nB = dir(90 + 100);\n\nC = dir(90 - 140);\n\nD = (A + reflect(B,C)*(A))/2;\n\nE = -A;\n\nO = (0,0);\n\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\n\ndraw(A--D);\n\ndraw(A--E,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, W);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, S);\n\ndot(\"$O$\", O, dir(0));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since triangle $ACD$ is right, $\\angle CAD = 90^\\circ - \\angle ACD = 90^\\circ - 50^\\circ = 40^\\circ$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, O;\n\nA = dir(90);\nB = dir(90 + 100);\nC = dir(90 - 140);\nD = (A + reflect(B,C)*(A))/2;\nE = -A;\nO = (0,0);\n\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(A--E);\ndraw(O--C);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, W);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, S);\ndot(\"$O$\", O, NE);\n[/asy]\n\nAlso, $\\angle AOC = 2 \\angle ABC = 2 \\cdot 70^\\circ = 140^\\circ$.  Since triangle $ACO$ is isosceles with $AO = CO$, $\\angle CAO = (180^\\circ - \\angle AOC)/2 = (180^\\circ - 140^\\circ)/2 = 20^\\circ$.  Hence, $\\angle DAE = \\angle CAD - \\angle CAO = 40^\\circ - 20^\\circ = \\boxed{20^\\circ}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Arc $AC$ is a quarter-circle with center $B$. The shaded region $ABC$ is \"rolled\" along a straight board $PQ$ until it reaches its original orientation for the first time with point $B$ landing at point $B^{\\prime}$.

Express your answer in simplest form.\n\n[asy]\n\nfilldraw((0,0)--(-1,0)..dir(135)..(0,1)--(0,0)--cycle,gray,linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,1)..dir(45)..(1,0),dashed);\n\ndraw((1-7/25,24/25)--(1+17/25,31/25)..(1-7/25,24/25)+dir(-30)..(1,0)--(1-7/25,24/25)--cycle,dashed);\n\ndraw((3.5,0)--(2.5,0)..(3.5,0)+dir(135)..(3.5,1)--(3.5,0)--cycle,dashed);\n\ndraw((-1.5,0)--(4,0),linewidth(2));\n\nlabel(\"P\",(-1.5,0),W);\nlabel(\"A\",(-1,0),S);\nlabel(\"B\",(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"C\",(0,1),N);\n\nlabel(\"A$^{\\prime}$\",(2.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"B$^{\\prime}$\",(3.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"Q\",(4,0),E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can divide the rolling into four phases:\n\nPhase 1: The quarter circle pivots $90^\\circ$ about point $B$. [asy]\npair A = (-1,0); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (0,1);\npath q = B--A..dir(135)..C--cycle;\ndraw( (-1.5, 0)--(1.5, 0), linewidth(2) );\nfilldraw( q, gray, linewidth(2) );\ndraw(rotate(-90)*q, dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, S); label(\"$B$\", B, S); label(\"$C$\", C, N);\n[/asy] In this phase, point $B$ does not move.\n\nPhase 2: The quarter circle pivots $90^\\circ$ about point $C$. [asy]\npair A = (0,1); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (1,0);\npath q = B--A..dir(45)..C--cycle;\ndraw( (-0.5, 0)--(2.5, 0), linewidth(2) );\nfilldraw( q, gray, linewidth(2) );\ndraw(rotate(-90, (1,0))*q, dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N); label(\"$B$\", B, S); label(\"$C$\", C, S);\n[/asy] In this phase, point $B$ is always $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ cm away from point $C$, so its path is a quarter-circle with radius $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$. The circumference of a circle with radius $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ is $2\\pi(\\frac{2}{\\pi}) = 4$, so $B$ travels $\\frac{1}{4}(4) = 1$ cm.\n\nPhase 3: The quarter circle rolls along arc $CA$. [asy]\npair A = (1,0); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (0,-1);\npath q = B--A..dir(-45)..C--cycle;\ndraw( (-0.5, -1)--(2.07, -1), linewidth(2) );\nfilldraw( q, gray, linewidth(2) );\ndraw(shift((1.57,0))*rotate(-90)*q, dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N); label(\"$B$\", B, N); label(\"$C$\", C, S);\n[/asy] In this phase, $B$ is always $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ away from the ground, so its path is a straight line segment parallel to the ground. From the diagram, we see the length of this line segment is equal to the distance between the original position of $C$ and the new position of $A$. This distance is traced out by arc $CA$ as it rolls. So its length is the length of arc $CA$, which is 1 cm (since it's a quarter of a circle with radius $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$, a length we've already calculated). So the path of $B$ has length 1 cm.\n\nPhase 4: The quarter circle pivots $90^\\circ$ about point $A$. [asy]\npair A = (0,-1); pair B = (0,0); pair C = (-1,0);\npath q = B--A..dir(-135)..C--cycle;\ndraw( (-1.5, -1)--(1.5, -1), linewidth(2) );\nfilldraw( q, gray, linewidth(2) );\ndraw(rotate(-90, (0,-1))*q, dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, S); label(\"$B$\", B, N); label(\"$C$\", C, N);\n[/asy] As in phase 2, the path of $B$ has length 1 cm.\n\nPutting this together, the path of point $B$ has total length $1 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{3\\text{ cm}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $DEF$, we have $\\angle D = 25^\\circ$, $\\angle E = 90^\\circ$, and $EF = 9$.  Find $DE$ to the nearest tenth.  You may use a calculator for this problem.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We start with a diagram:\n\n[asy]\npair D,EE,F;\n\nEE = (0,0);\nF = (8,0);\nD = (0,8*Tan(65));\ndraw(D--EE--F--D);\ndraw(rightanglemark(F,EE,D,18));\nlabel(\"$E$\",EE,SW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\nlabel(\"$9$\",F/2,S);\n[/asy]\n\nWe seek $DE$, and we have $EF$ and $\\angle D$.  We can relate these three with the tangent function: \\[\\tan D = \\frac{EF}{DE},\\]so  \\[DE = \\frac{EF}{\\tan D} = \\frac{9}{\\tan D} \\approx \\boxed{19.3}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circular ceiling fan rotates at a constant speed of $80$ revolutions per minute.
