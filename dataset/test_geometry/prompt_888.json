    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circular cylindrical post with a circumference of 4 feet has a string wrapped around it, spiraling from the bottom of the post to the top of the post. The string evenly loops around the post exactly four full times, starting at the bottom edge and finishing at the top edge. The height of the post is 12 feet. What is the length, in feet, of the string?\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,20)..(1,19.5)..(2,20)--(2,0)..(1,-.5)..(0,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,20)..(1,20.5)..(2,20),linewidth(1));\ndraw((1,19.5)--(0,18.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((2,.5)--(1,-.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((2,16)--(0,14),linewidth(1));\ndraw((2,11)--(0,9),linewidth(1));\n\ndraw((2,6)--(0,4),linewidth(1));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each time the string spirals around the post, it travels 3 feet up and 4 feet around the post.  If we were to unroll this path, it would look like: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,3)--(4,3)--(4,0)--cycle, linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(4,3),linewidth(.7));\nlabel(\"3\",(0,1.5),W);\nlabel(\"4\",(2,3),N);\n[/asy] Clearly, a 3-4-5 right triangle has been formed.  For each time around the post, the string has length 5.  So, the total length of the string will be $4\\cdot 5=\\boxed{20}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A telephone pole is supported by a steel cable which extends from the top of the pole to a point on the ground 3 meters from its base. When Leah walks 2.5 meters from the base of the pole toward the point where the cable is attached to the ground, her head just touches the cable. Leah is 1.5 meters tall. How many meters tall is the pole?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, let us draw a diagram (not to scale!): [asy]\npair A,B,C,D,E;\n\nA=(0,0);\nB=(0,4.5);\nC=(6,0);\nD=(5,0);\nE=(5,0.75);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(D--E);\n\nlabel(\"A\",A,W);\nlabel(\"B\",B,W);\nlabel(\"C\",C+(0.4,0));\nlabel(\"D\",D, NW);\nlabel(\"E\",E+(0.3,0.2));\n[/asy] Here, $AB$ is the telephone pole and $C$ is the point in the ground where the cable $BC$ is anchored. The key is to recognize that $ABC$ is a right triangle since the telephone pole is upright. Meanwhile, Leah stands at $D$ and touches the cable at $E,$ so $DEC$ is another right triangle. Not only that, but we see that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle DEC$ thanks to AA similarity.\n\nFrom the problem, We have that $DE = 1.5\\text{m},$ $AC = 3\\text{m},$ and $AD = 2.5\\text{m}.$ Therefore, $DC = AC - AD = 0.5\\text{m}.$ We desire $AB.$ From $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle DEC,$ we get:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{AB}{AC} &= \\frac{DE}{DC} \\\\\n\\frac{AB}{3\\text{m}} &= \\frac{1.5\\text{m}}{0.5\\text{m}} = 3 \\\\\nAB &= 3 \\cdot 3\\text{m} = \\boxed{9}\\text{ meters}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two cylindrical cans have the same volume. The height of one can is triple the height of the other. If the radius of the narrower can is 12 units, how many units are in the length of the radius of the wider can? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the wide can be $h$ and the height of the narrow can be $3h$.  Let the wide can have radius $x$ units.  Since the two volumes are equal, we have \\[\\pi (12^2) (3h) = \\pi (x^2) (h).\\] Solving yields $x = 12\\sqrt{3}$ so the wide can has radius $\\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle has a radius of three inches. The distance from the center of the circle to chord $CD$ is two inches. How many inches long is chord $CD$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Call the center of the circle O, and call the point where the radius of the circle bisects the chord E.  Thus, the line segment from the center of the circle to point E has length 2, and we have $\\triangle ODE$ with a leg of 2 and a hypotenuse of 3.  Thus, the other leg, DE has length $\\sqrt{5}$, and since DE is $\\frac{CD}{2}$, we have $CD = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is $SA = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh,$ where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. A particular solid right cylinder of radius 2 feet has a total surface area of $12\\pi$ square feet. What is the height of this cylinder?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the cylinder be $h$; we then have \\[SA = 2\\pi (2^2)+2\\pi (2)(h) = 12\\pi.\\]Solving yields $4\\pi h = 4 \\pi$ so $h = \\boxed{1}$ foot.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Five points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $O$ lie on a flat field.  $A$ is directly north of $O$, $B$ is directly west of $O$, $C$ is directly south of $O$, and $D$ is directly east of $O$. The  distance between $C$ and $D$ is 140 m.  A hot-air balloon is positioned in the air at $H$ directly above $O$. The balloon is held in place by four ropes $HA$, $HB$, $HC$, and $HD$.  Rope $HC$ has length 150 m and rope $HD$ has length 130 m. How high is the balloon above the field (that is, the length of $OH$)? [asy]\nsize(200);\npair A, B, C, D, O, H, W, X, Y, Z;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(1,1);\nD=(1.5,-.3);\nB=(-1.5,.3);\nC=(-1,-1);\nH=(0,2.5);\nW=(5/3)*(A+D);\nX=(5/3)*(A+B);\nY=(-1)*(W);\nZ=(-1)*(X);\ndraw(W--X--Y--Z--W);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(B--D);\ndraw(O--H, linewidth(1));\ndraw(A--H, dashed);\ndraw(B--H, dashed);\ndraw(C--H, dashed);\ndraw(D--H, dashed);\ndot(A);\ndot(B);\ndot(C);\ndot(D);\ndot(O);\ndot(H);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NE);\nlabel(\"B\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, NE);\nlabel(\"O\", O, SE);\nlabel(\"H\", H, NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $OC=c$, $OD=d$ and $OH=h$. [asy]\nsize(200);\npair A, B, C, D, O, H, W, X, Y, Z;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(1,1);\nD=(1.5,-.3);\nB=(-1.5,.3);\nC=(-1,-1);\nH=(0,2.5);\nW=(5/3)*(A+D);\nX=(5/3)*(A+B);\nY=(-1)*(W);\nZ=(-1)*(X);\ndraw(W--X--Y--Z--W);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(B--D);\ndraw(O--H, linewidth(1));\ndraw(C--D, dashed);\ndraw(C--H, dashed);\ndraw(D--H, dashed);\ndot(C);\ndot(D);\ndot(O);\ndot(H);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, NE);\nlabel(\"O\", O, SE);\nlabel(\"H\", H, NW);\nlabel(\"$c$\", (C+O)/2, N);\nlabel(\"$d$\", (D+O)/2, N);\nlabel(\"$h$\", (O+H)/2, E);\nlabel(\"130\", (H+D)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"140\", (C+D)/2, S);\nlabel(\"150\", (C+H)/2, NW);\n[/asy] Note that $OH$ is perpendicular to the field, so $OH$ is perpendicular to $OC$ and to $OD$.  Also, since $OD$ points east and $OC$ points south, then $OD$ is perpendicular to $OC$. Since $HC=150$, we have  $$h^2+c^2=150^2$$ by the Pythagorean Theorem. Since $HD=130$, we have $$h^2+d^2=130^2.$$ Since $CD=140$, we have $$c^2+d^2 = 140^2.$$. Adding the first two equations, we obtain $$2h^2+c^2+d^2=150^2+130^2.$$ Since $c^2+d^2=140^2$, we have  \\begin{align*}\n2h^2 + 140^2 &= 150^2+130^2\\\\\n2h^2 & = 150^2 + 130^2 - 140^2 \\\\\n2h^2 & = 19800 \\\\\nh^2 & = 9900\\\\\nh & = \\sqrt{9900}=30\\sqrt{11}\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the height of the balloon above the field is $\\boxed{30\\sqrt{11}}$ meters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cylinder with its diameter equal to its height is inscribed in a right circular cone. The cone has diameter 10 and altitude 12, and the axes of the cylinder and cone coincide. Find the radius of the cylinder. Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cylinder have radius $r$ and height $2r$. Since $\\triangle APQ$ is similar to $\\triangle AOB$, we have $$\\frac{12-2r}{r} = \\frac{12}{5}, \\text{ so } r = \\boxed{\\frac{30}{11}}.$$[asy]\ndraw((0,2)..(-6,0)--(6,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,-2)..(-6,0)--(6,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,1)..(-3,0)--(3,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,-1)..(-3,0)--(3,0)..cycle);\nfill((-6,0.01)--(-6,-0.01)--(6,-0.01)--(6,0.01)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,14)--(0,0)--(6,0),dashed);\ndraw((0,8)..(-3,7)--(3,7)..cycle);\ndraw((0,6)..(-3,7)--(3,7)..cycle);\nfill((-3,7.01)--(-3,6.99)--(3,6.99)--(3,7.01)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,7)--(3,7),dashed);\ndraw((-6,0)--(0,14)--(6,0));\ndraw((-3,0)--(-3,7));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,7));\nlabel(\"{\\tiny O}\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny B}\",(6,0),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny P}\",(0,7),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny Q}\",(3,7),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny A}\",(0,14),E);\ndraw((0,-2.5)--(6,-2.5),Arrows);\ndraw((-6.5,0)--(-6.5,14),Arrows);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 5}\",(3,-2.5),S);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12}\",(-6.5,7),W);\ndraw((10,0)--(15,0)--(10,12)--cycle);\ndraw((10,6)--(12.5,6));\ndraw((15.5,0)--(15.5,12),Arrows);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny O}\",(10,0),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny P}\",(10,6),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny A}\",(10,12),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 2r}\",(10,3),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12-2r}\",(10,9),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny B}\",(15,0),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny Q}\",(12.5,6),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12}\",(15.5,6),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 5}\",(12.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone has a volume of $12\\pi$ cubic centimeters. The height of the cone is 4 cm. How many centimeters is the circumference of the base of the cone, in terms of $\\pi$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. We're given that the volume is $12\\pi$ and the height is $4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 = 12\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$. Therefore, the circumference of the base is $2\\pi r = \\boxed{6\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Billy is hiking in Colorado. He walks eastward four miles, then turns $60$ degrees northward and walks six miles. How far is he from his starting point? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Suppose Billy starts at point $A$, turns at point $B$, and ends at point $D$, as shown below. If Billy turns $60^{\\circ}$ northward and walks six miles, then we can draw a $30-60-90$ triangle whose hypotenuse is $6$ miles (triangle $BCD$ below).\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\n\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7) + fontsize(10));\npair A,B,C,D;\nA = (0,0);\nB=(4,0);\nC =(7,0);\nD = (7,3*sqrt(3));\ndraw (A--B--D--A);\ndraw(B--C--D,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$4$\",B/2,S);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(B+D)/2,NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\n[/asy]\nIt follows that Billy traveled $6/2 = 3$ miles eastward during these $6$ miles, and that he traveled $3 \\cdot \\sqrt{3}$ miles northward during these $6$ miles. In total, Billy traveled $4 + 3 = 7$ miles eastward and $3\\sqrt{3}$ miles northward. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from his starting point is $\\sqrt{(7)^2 + (3\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 27} = \\sqrt{76} = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{19}}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 22, AC=12,$ and $BC=14$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=24$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24\\cdot 2\\cdot 12\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 24\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$24\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 24,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The height of a cylindrical pole is 12 feet and its circumference is 2 feet. A rope is attached to a point on the circumference at the bottom of the pole. The rope is then wrapped tightly around the pole four times before it reaches a point on the top directly above the starting point at the bottom. What is the minimum number of feet in the length of the rope? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\nAnswer:\n",
