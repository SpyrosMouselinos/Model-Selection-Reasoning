    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $ABC$, $AB=10$, $AC=6$ and $BC=8$ units.  What is the distance from $C$ to the midpoint of segment $AB$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse.  Therefore, the desired distance is $10/2 = \\boxed{5}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with legs $AB$ and $AC$. Points $X$ and $Y$ lie on legs $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, so that $AX:XB = AY:YC = 1:2$. If $BY = 16$ units, and $CX = 28$ units, what is the length of hypotenuse $BC$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $AB = x$ and $AC = y$. Then we can write two Pythagorean equations from the information given: $(x/3)^2 + y^2 = 28^2$ and $x^2 + (y/3)^2 = 16^2$. These equations become $x^2/9 + y^2 = 784$ and $x^2 + y^2/9 = 256$. Multiplying them both by 9, we get $x^2 + 9y^2= 7056$ and $9x^2 + y^2\n= 2304$. Now we add the two equations to get $10x^2 + 10y^2 = 9360$, which can be reduced to $x^2\n+ y^2 = 936$. We do not need to solve for $x$ and $y$ since 936 is the square of the hypotenuse $BC$. The length is thus $\\sqrt{936} = \\sqrt{(36 \\times 26)} = \\sqrt{36} \\times \\sqrt{26} = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{26}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of the sides of a triangle are 6 cm, 7 cm and 9 cm.  In a similar triangle whose perimeter is 110 cm, what is the length of the longest side, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the ratio of side lengths between the similar triangle and the given triangle be $x$, so the lengths of the similar triangle are $6x$, $7x$, and $9x$.  We are given that $6x+7x+9x=110$; solving yields $x=\\frac{110}{(6+7+9)} = \\frac{110}{22}=5$.  The length of the longest side is thus $9x = 9 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{45}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two triangles are similar. The ratio of their areas is 1:4. If the height of the smaller triangle is 3 cm, how long is the corresponding height of the larger triangle, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If any linear dimension (such as radius, side length, height, etc.) of a closed, two-dimensional figure is multiplied by $k$ while the shape of the figure remains the same, the area of the figure is multiplied by $k^2$.  Since the area is multiplied by 4 in going from the smaller triangle to the larger triangle, we have $k^2=4$ which implies $k=2$.  Therefore, each linear dimension is multiplied by 2, so the height of the larger triangle is $(3\\text{ cm})\\times2=\\boxed{6}$ centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In $\\triangle ABC$ the median from $A$ is given perpendicular to the median from $B$. If $BC=7$ and $AC=6$, find the length of $AB$.\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 4\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{17} \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 4.25\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 2\\sqrt{5} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 4.5$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]  draw((-16,0)--(8,0)); draw((-16,0)--(16,-24)); draw((16,-24)--(0,24)--(0,-12)); draw((-16,0)--(0,24)); draw((0,2)--(2,2)--(2,0)); draw((0,-12)--(8,0),dotted);  dot((16,-24)); label(\"C\",(16,-24),SE); dot((-16,0)); label(\"A\",(-16,0),W); dot((0,24)); label(\"B\",(0,24),N);  label(\"3\",(8,-18),SW); label(\"3\",(-8,-6),SW); label(\"3.5\",(12,-12),NE); label(\"3.5\",(4,12),NE);  dot((0,-12)); label(\"M\",(0,-12),SW); dot((8,0)); label(\"N\",(8,0),NE); dot((0,0)); label(\"G\",(0,0),NW);  [/asy]By SAS Similarity, $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle MNC$, so $AB \\parallel MN$. Thus, by AA Similarity, $\\triangle AGB \\sim \\triangle NGM$.\nLet $a = GN$ and $b = GM$, so $AG = 2a$ and $BG = 2b$. By the Pythagorean Theorem,\\[4a^2 + b^2 = 9\\]\\[a^2 + 4b^2 = \\frac{49}{4}\\]Adding the two equations yields $5a^2 + 5b^2 = \\frac{85}{4}$, so $a^2 + b^2 = \\frac{17}{4}$. Thus, $MN = \\frac{\\sqrt{17}}{2}$, so $AB = \\boxed{\\sqrt{17}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let triangle $ABC$ be a right triangle in the xy-plane with a right angle at $C$. Given that the length of the hypotenuse $AB$ is $60$, and that the medians through $A$ and $B$ lie along the lines $y=x+3$ and $y=2x+4$ respectively, find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Translate so the medians are $y = x$, and $y = 2x$, then model the points $A: (a,a)$ and $B: (b,2b)$. $(0,0)$ is the centroid, and is the average of the vertices, so $C: (- a - b, - a - 2b)$\n$AB = 60$ so\n$3600 = (a - b)^2 + (2b - a)^2$\n$3600 = 2a^2 + 5b^2 - 6ab \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)$\n$AC$ and $BC$ are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is $-1$, giving\n$\\left(\\frac {2a + 2b}{2a + b}\\right)\\left(\\frac {a + 4b}{a + 2b}\\right) = - 1$\n$2a^2 + 5b^2 = - \\frac {15}{2}ab \\ \\ \\ \\  (2)$\nCombining $(1)$ and $(2)$, we get $ab = - \\frac {800}{3}$\nUsing the determinant product for area of a triangle (this simplifies nicely, add columns 1 and 2, add rows 2 and 3), the area is $\\left|\\frac {3}{2}ab\\right|$, so we get the answer to be $\\boxed{400}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $C$ has radius 6 cm. How many square centimeters are in the area of the largest possible inscribed triangle having one side as a diameter of circle $C$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We may consider the diameter of circle $C$ as the base of the inscribed triangle; its length is $12\\text{ cm}$. Then the corresponding height extends from some point on the diameter to some point on the circle $C$. The greatest possible height is a radius of $C$, achieved when the triangle is right isosceles: [asy]\nunitsize(8);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),6));\ndraw(((-6,0)--(6,0)));\nlabel(\"$12$\",(0,0),S);\ndraw(((-6,-0.6)--(-0.6,-0.6)),BeginArrow);\ndraw(((0.6,-0.6)--(6,-0.6)),EndArrow);\ndraw(((-6,0)--(0,6)));\ndraw(((0,6)--(6,0)));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,6)),dashed);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(0,2.5),E);\n[/asy] In this case, the height is $6\\text{ cm}$, so the area of the triangle is $$\\frac 12\\cdot 12\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{36}\\text{ square centimeters}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right triangle has a side length of 21 inches and a hypotenuse of 29 inches. A second triangle is similar to the first and has a hypotenuse of 87 inches. What is the length of the shortest side of the second triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we calculate that the other leg of the original right triangle must be $$\\sqrt{29^2 - 21^2} = \\sqrt{841 - 441} = \\sqrt{400} = 20$$ inches. Since 87 is 3 times 29, the length of the shortest side of the second triangle must be $3 \\times 20 = \\boxed{60\\text{ inches}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on a circle such that $AB = 11$ and $CD = 19.$ Point $P$ is on segment $AB$ with $AP = 6$, and $Q$ is on segment $CD$ with $CQ = 7$. The line through $P$ and $Q$ intersects the circle at $X$ and $Y$. If $PQ = 27$, find $XY$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First of all, suppose $X, P, Q, Y$ lie in that order. We make a sketch (diagram not to scale!): [asy]\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\npair A,B,C,D,X,Y;\nA=dir(100)*(20,0);\nB=dir(40)*(20,0);\nC=dir(200)*(20,0);\nD=dir(320)*(20,0);\nX=dir(80)*(20,0);\nY=dir(280)*(20,0);\ndraw(circle((0,0),20));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(X--Y);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,SE);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,N);\nlabel(\"$Y$\",Y,S);\nlabel(\"$P$\",(1,15));\nlabel(\"$Q$\",(5.5,-8.5));\n[/asy] Let $PX = x$ and $QY = y$. By power of a point from $P$, $x\\cdot(27+y) = 30$, and by power of a point from $Q$, $y\\cdot(27+x) = 84$. Subtracting the first from the second, $27\\cdot(y-x) = 54$, so $y = x+2$. Now, $x\\cdot(29+x) = 30$, and we find $x = 1, -30$. Since $-30$ makes no sense, we take $x = 1$ and obtain $XY = 1 + 27 + 3 = \\boxed{31}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $AXY$ is similar to triangle $ZBC$. If $AX = 6$ cm, $ZB = 18$ cm and $ZC = 63$ cm, what is the length of segment $AY$, in centimeters?\n\nAnswer:\n",
