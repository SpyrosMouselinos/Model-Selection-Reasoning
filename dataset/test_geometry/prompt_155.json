    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $AB$ parallel to $CD$, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. If the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, what is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(2.5inch);\npair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (-3,4);\nB = (5,4);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (0,0);\nE = intersectionpoint(A--C, B--D);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$E$\", E, N);\n[/asy] We will write the area of triangle $XYZ$ as $[XYZ].$  Since triangles $ADC$ and $BCD$ share a base and have the same altitude length to that base, they have the same area. Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$. Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$. Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \\boxed{98}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$, the parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths of 8 and 20 units, respectively, and the altitude is 12 units. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. What is the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ in square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$. Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the trapezoid shown, the ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $ADC$ is $7:3$. If $AB + CD = 210$ cm, how long is segment $\\overline{AB}$? [asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\npair A = (0,0), B = (5,0), C = (3,2), D = (1,2);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle--C);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW); label(\"$B$\",B,SE); label(\"$C$\",C,NE); label(\"$D$\",D,NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $h$ be the height of the trapezoid.  The height of the trapezoid is also a height of $ABC$ and of $ADC$.  Specifically, we have $[ABC] = (AB)(h)/2$ and $[ADC] = (CD)(h)/2$, so $[ABC]:[ADC] = AB:CD$.  Since we are given that this area ratio equals $7:3$, we know that $AB:CD = 7:3$.  Therefore, $AB = 7x$ and $CD = 3x$ for some  value of $x$.  Since $AB + CD = 210$ cm, we have $7x+3x=210$, so $10x=210$ and $x=21$. Therefore,  $AB=7 \\times 21 = \\boxed{147\\text{ cm}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Square $ABCD$ has area $200$. Point $E$ lies on side $\\overline{BC}$. Points $F$ and $G$ are the midpoints of $\\overline{AE}$ and $\\overline{DE}$, respectively. Given that quadrilateral $BEGF$ has area $34$, what is the area of triangle $GCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We begin by drawing a diagram: [asy]\nsize(5cm);\npair a=(0,1); pair b=(1,1); pair c=(1,0); pair d=(0,0); pair e=(1,.82); pair f=(a+e)/2; pair g=(d+e)/2;\nfill(b--e--g--f--cycle,gray);\nfill(g--c--d--cycle,pink);\ndot(a);dot(b);dot(c);dot(d);dot(e);dot(f);dot(g);\ndraw(a--b--c--d--a);\ndraw(a--e--d);\ndraw(e--g--f--b);\ndraw(g--c);\nlabel(\"$A$\",a,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",b,NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",c,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",d,SW);\nlabel(\"$E$\",e,E);\nlabel(\"$F$\",f,SW);\nlabel(\"$G$\",g,NW);\n[/asy] We know that the gray area above (quadrilateral $BEGF$) has area $34$, and we wish to determine the pink area ($\\triangle GCD$).\n\nFirst we note that $\\triangle AED$ has base $AD$, equal to the side length of square $ABCD$, and also has height equal to the side length of square $ABCD$. Thus $\\triangle AED$ has area equal to half the area of $ABCD$, or $100$.\n\nTriangle $\\triangle FEG$ has half the base and half the height of $\\triangle AED$, so its area is $\\frac12\\cdot\\frac 12\\cdot 100 = 25$.\n\nSince quadrilateral $BEGF$ can be divided into $\\triangle FEG$ and $\\triangle FBE$, we know that $\\triangle FBE$ has area $34-25=9$. This is half the area of $\\triangle ABE$ (which shares an altitude with $\\triangle FBE$ and has twice the corresponding base). Thus, $\\triangle ABE$ has area $18$.\n\nSince square $ABCD$ can be divided into triangles $ABE$, $AED$, and $ECD$, we know that the area of $\\triangle ECD$ is $200-100-18 = 82$. Finally, $\\triangle GCD$ shares an altitude with $\\triangle ECD$ and has half the corresponding base, so the area of $\\triangle GCD$ is $\\frac 12\\cdot 82$, or $\\boxed{41}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$ the lengths of the bases $AB$ and $CD$ are 8 and 17 respectively. The legs of the trapezoid are extended beyond $A$ and $B$ to meet at point $E$. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $EAB$ to the area of trapezoid $ABCD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\npair A,B,C,D,F;\nA = (0,0);\nB = (8,0);\nD = (-4,7);\nC = (13,7);\nF = intersectionpoint(D -- (A + 3*(A-D)), C -- (B + 3*(B-C)));\ndraw(A--F--C--D--A--B);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$E$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,NE);\n[/asy]\n\nTriangles $EAB$ and $EDC$ are similar, and the ratio of their corresponding sides is $\\frac{CD}{AB} = \\frac{17}{8}$. Therefore, we have \\[\\frac{[EDC]}{[EAB]} = \\left(\\frac{17}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{289}{64}.\\]  Since $[EDC] = [EAB] + [ABCD]$, we have $\\frac{[ABCD] + [EAB]}{[EAB]} = \\frac{289}{64}$, so \\[\\frac{[ABCD]}{[EAB]} + 1 = \\frac{289}{64}.\\] Therefore, $\\frac{[ABCD]}{[EAB]} = \\frac{225}{64}$, so $\\frac{[EAB]}{[ABCD]} = \\boxed{\\frac{64}{225}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $AHI$ is equilateral. We know $\\overline{BC}$, $\\overline{DE}$ and $\\overline{FG}$ are all parallel to $\\overline{HI}$ and $AB = BD = DF = FH$. What is the ratio of the area of trapezoid $FGIH$ to the area of triangle $AHI$?

Since $\\bigtriangleup AFG$ takes up $\\frac{9}{16}$ of the area of $\\bigtriangleup AHI$, trapezoid $FGIH$ takes up the other $\\frac{7}{16}$ of the area.  More formally,  \\begin{align*}\n[AFG]+[FGIH]&=[AHI] \\implies \\\\\n\\frac{[AFG]}{[AHI]}+\\frac{[FGIH]}{[AHI]}&=1 \\implies \\\\\n\\frac{[FGIH]}{[AHI]}&=1- \\frac{[AFG]}{[AHI]} \\\\\n&=1-\\frac{9}{16} \\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{7}{16}}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $ABC$ is an equilateral triangle with sides equal to 2cm. $\\overline{BC}$ is extended its own length to $D$, and $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$.

Knowing this, we have $[\\triangle AEF] = [\\triangle EFB] = [\\triangle FBC] = [\\triangle FCD]$.  We see that $\\triangle ABC$ contains 3 of these smaller triangles.  $BEFC$, our desired area, contains 2 of these smaller triangles.  Hence \\[ [BEFC] = \\frac{2}{3} [\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}= \\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system, trapezoid $ABCD$ has vertices $A(1, -2)$, $B(1, 1)$, $C(5, 7)$ and $D(5, 1)$. What is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two bases of the trapezoids are the segments $AB$ and $CD$, and the height is the perpendicular distance between the bases, which in this case is the difference of the $x$-coordinates: $5 - 1 = 4$. Similarly, the lengths of the bases are the differences of the $y$-coordinates of their two endpoints. Using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1+ b_2)h$, the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(3+6)(4) = \\boxed{18}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, medians $AD$ and $CE$ intersect at $P$, $PE=1.5$, $PD=2$, and $DE=2.5$.  What is the area of $AEDC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that $1.5^2 + 2^2 = 2.5^2,$ so $\\triangle PED$ has a right angle at $P.$ (Alternatively, you could note that $(1.5, 2, 2.5)$ is half of the Pythagorean triple $(3,4,5).$) [asy]size(6cm);pair P=(0,0),D=(0,-2),E=(-1.5,0),C=(3,0),A=(0,4),B=extension(A,E,D,C);draw(A--B--C--cycle^^C--E^^A--D);draw(rightanglemark(E,P,D));draw(E--D);dot(\"$A$\",A,N);dot(\"$B$\",B,SW);dot(\"$C$\",C,dir(0));dot(\"$D$\",D,SSE);dot(\"$E$\",E,NW);dot(\"$P$\",P,NE);[/asy] Since the centroid $P$ divides medians $AD$ and $CE$ in the ratio $2 : 1,$ we have $CP = 2 \\cdot EP = 2 \\cdot 1.5 = 3$ and $AP = 2 \\cdot DP = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4.$ Then quadrilateral $AEDC$ consists of four right triangles; we can then compute its area as \\[[AEDC] = \\tfrac12 (4 \\cdot 1.5 + 2 \\cdot 1.5 + 3 \\cdot 2 + 4 \\cdot 3) = \\boxed{13.5}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n On square $ABCD$, point $E$ lies on side $AD$ and point $F$ lies on side $BC$, so that $BE=EF=FD=30$.
