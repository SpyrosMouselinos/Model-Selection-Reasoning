    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measures of the interior angles of a convex hexagon form an increasing arithmetic sequence. How many such sequences are possible if the hexagon is not equiangular and all of the angle degree measures are positive integers less than $150$ degrees?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The number of degrees in a hexagon is $(6-2) \\cdot 180=720$ degrees. Setting the degree of the smallest angle to be $x$, and the increment to be $d$, we get that the sum of all of the degrees is $x+x+d+x+2d+x+3d+x+4d+x+5d=6x+15d=720$. We want $15d$ to be even so that adding it to an even number $6x$ would produce an even number $720$. Therefore, $d$ must be even. The largest angle we can have must be less than $150$, so we try even values for $d$ until we get an angle that's greater or equal to $150$.  Similarly, we can conclude that $x$ must be a multiple of 5.\n\nThe largest angle is $x + 5d.$  We notice that, if we divide both sides of $6x + 15d = 720$ by 3, we get $2x + 5d = 240.$  For $x + 5d < 150,$ we must have $x > 90.$  The largest value of $d$ occurs when $x = 95$ and $5d = 240 - 2x = 240 - 2 \\cdot 95 = 240 - 190 = 50,$ or $d = 10.$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ values for $d$: $2,4,6,8,$ and $10$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measure of each exterior angle of a regular polygon is $30$ degrees. What is the sum of the measures of the interior angles, in degrees?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Taking one exterior angle per vertex, the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$. If each exterior angle is $30^\\circ$, then the polygon has $\\frac{360}{30}=12$ sides. The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$, so for a polygon with 12 sides, the sum of the interior angles is $180(12-2)=\\boxed{1800}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Polygon $ABCDEF$ is a regular hexagon. What is the measure in degrees of angle $ABF$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In triangle $ABF$, the two acute angles are equal since $AB=AF$. Also, the measure of $\\angle A$ is $180^\\circ(6-2)/6=120^\\circ$.  Letting $x$ be the measure of $\\angle ABF$, we have \\[\n120^\\circ+x+x=180^\\circ \\implies x=\\boxed{30}\\text{ degrees}.\n\\] [asy]\nsize(5cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nint i;\npair A=dir(0), B=dir(60), C=dir(120), D=dir(180), Ep=dir(240), F=dir(300);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D,Ep,F};\nstring[] alphabet={\"$A$\",\"$B$\",\"$C$\",\"$D$\",\"$E$\",\"$F$\"};\ndot(dots);\nfor(i=0;i<6;++i)\n{\n\ndraw(dir(60*i)--dir(60*i+60));\n\nlabel(alphabet[i],dots[i],dots[i]);\n}\ndraw(A--B--F);\ndraw(anglemark(F,B,A));\ndraw(anglemark(A,F,B));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The figure shows a square in the interior of a regular hexagon.  The square and regular hexagon share a common side. What is the degree measure of $\\angle ABC$? [asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;\nA=(0,.866);\nB=(.5,1.732);\nC=(1.5,1.732);\nD=(2,.866);\nE=(1.5,0);\nF=(.5,0);\nG=(.5,1);\nH=(1.5,1);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--E);\ndraw(E--F);\ndraw(F--A);\ndraw(F--G);\ndraw(G--H);\ndraw(H--E);\ndraw(D--H);\nlabel(\"A\", C, N);\nlabel(\"B\", D, E);\nlabel(\"C\", H, N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label the lower right corner of the square point $D$ and the lower left corner $E$. The interior angles of a regular hexagon are 120 degrees and the interior angles of a square are 90 degrees. Thus, $m\\angle BDC=m \\angle BDE - m\\angle CDE=120^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 30^\\circ$. In addition, because the square and regular hexagon share a side and all of their sides have the same length, segments $CD$ and $BD$ have the same length. Thus, triangle $BCD$ is isosceles.\n\nBecause the base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent, $m\\angle BCD = m \\angle CBD=x$. In addition, because the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have  \\begin{align*}\n180^\\circ &= m\\angle BDC+m\\angle BCD + m\\angle CBD \\\\\n&=30^\\circ + x + x \\\\\n150^\\circ &= 2x \\\\\n75^\\circ = x\n\\end{align*} Thus, $m\\angle CBD=75^\\circ$. Finally, we calculate $m\\angle ABC=m\\angle ABD- m\\angle CBD=120^\\circ-75^\\circ=\\boxed{45}^\\circ$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The degree measures of the angles in a convex 18-sided polygon form an increasing arithmetic sequence with integer values. Find the degree measure of the smallest angle.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The average angle in an 18-gon is $160^\\circ$. In an arithmetic sequence the average is the same as the median, so the middle two terms of the sequence average to $160^\\circ$. Thus for some positive (the sequence is increasing and thus non-constant) integer $d$, the middle two terms are $(160-d)^\\circ$ and $(160+d)^\\circ$. Since the step is $2d$ the last term of the sequence is $(160 + 17d)^\\circ$, which must be less than $180^\\circ$, since the polygon is convex. This gives $17d < 20$, so the only suitable positive integer $d$ is 1. The first term is then $(160-17)^\\circ = \\boxed{143}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $A = (0,0)$ and $B = (b,2)$ be points on the coordinate plane. Let $ABCDEF$ be a convex equilateral hexagon such that $\\angle FAB = 120^\\circ,$ $\\overline{AB}\\parallel \\overline{DE},$ $\\overline{BC}\\parallel \\overline{EF,}$ $\\overline{CD}\\parallel \\overline{FA},$ and the y-coordinates of its vertices are distinct elements of the set $\\{0,2,4,6,8,10\\}.$ The area of the hexagon can be written in the form $m\\sqrt {n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and n is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m + n.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The y-coordinate of $F$ must be $4$. All other cases yield non-convex and/or degenerate hexagons, which violate the problem statement.\nLetting $F = (f,4)$, and knowing that $\\angle FAB = 120^\\circ$, we can use rewrite $F$ using complex numbers: $f + 4 i = (b + 2 i)\\left(e^{i(2 \\pi / 3)}\\right) = (b + 2 i)\\left(-1/2 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} i\\right) = -\\frac{b}{2}-\\sqrt{3}+\\left(\\frac{b\\sqrt{3}}{2}-1\\right)i$. We solve for $b$ and $f$ and find that $F = \\left(-\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}, 4\\right)$ and that $B = \\left(\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}}, 2\\right)$.\nThe area of the hexagon can then be found as the sum of the areas of two congruent triangles ($EFA$ and $BCD$, with height $8$ and base $\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}$) and a parallelogram ($ABDE$, with height $8$ and base $\\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}}$).\n$A = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 8 \\times \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}} + 8 \\times \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{144}{\\sqrt{3}} = 48\\sqrt{3}$.\nThus, $m+n = \\boxed{51}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the degree measure of angle $LOQ$ when polygon $\\allowbreak LMNOPQ$ is a regular hexagon? [asy]\ndraw((-2,0)--(-1,1.73205081)--(1,1.73205081)--(2,0)--(1,-1.73205081)--(-1,-1.73205081)--cycle);\ndraw((-1,-1.73205081)--(1,1.73205081)--(1,-1.73205081)--cycle);\nlabel(\"L\",(-1,-1.73205081),SW);\nlabel(\"M\",(-2,0),W);\nlabel(\"N\",(-1,1.73205081),NW);\nlabel(\"O\",(1,1.73205081),N);\nlabel(\"P\",(2,0),E);\nlabel(\"Q\",(1,-1.73205081),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$. For a regular hexagon, the interior angles sum to $180(4)$, so each interior angle has a measure of $\\frac{180(4)}{6}=30\\cdot4=120^\\circ$. Since $\\overline{PO}$ and $\\overline{PQ}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, $\\triangle POQ$ is an isosceles triangle. The two base angles are congruent and sum to a degree measure of $180-120=60^\\circ$, so each base angle has a measure of $30^\\circ$. There are now a couple approaches to finishing the problem.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 1}$: We use the fact that trapezoid $PQLO$ is an isosceles trapezoid to solve for $x$ and $y$. Since $\\overline{PO}$ and $\\overline{QL}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $PQLO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal. So we know that $x+30=y$. Since the interior angle of a hexagon is $120^\\circ$ and $m\\angle PQO=30^\\circ$, we know that $\\angle OQL$ is a right angle. The acute angles of a right triangle sum to $90^\\circ$, so $x+y=90$. Now we can solve for $x$ with $x+(x+30)=90$, which yields $x=30$. The degree measure of $\\angle LOQ$ is $\\boxed{30^\\circ}$.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 2}$: We use the fact that trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid to solve for $x$. Since $\\overline{NO}$ and $\\overline{ML}$ are congruent sides of a regular hexagon, trapezoid $LMNO$ is an isosceles trapezoid and the base angles are equal. The interior angles of a trapezoid sum to $360^\\circ$, so we have $2z+120+120=360$, which yields $z=60$. Angle $O$ is an interior angle of a hexagon that measure $120^\\circ$, so $z+x+30=120$. We found that $z=60$, so $x=30$. The degree measure of $\\angle LOQ$ is $\\boxed{30^\\circ}$.\n\n[asy]\npen sm=fontsize(9);\ndraw((-2,0)--(-1,1.73205081)--(1,1.73205081)--(2,0)--(1,-1.73205081)--(-1,-1.73205081)--cycle);\ndraw((-1,-1.73205081)--(1,1.73205081)--(1,-1.73205081)--cycle);\nlabel(\"L\",(-1,-1.73205081),SW);\nlabel(\"M\",(-2,0),W);\nlabel(\"N\",(-1,1.73205081),NW);\nlabel(\"O\",(1,1.73205081),N);\nlabel(\"P\",(2,0),E);\nlabel(\"Q\",(1,-1.73205081),S);\nlabel(\"$120^\\circ$\", (2,0), W, sm);\nlabel(\"$120^\\circ$\", (-2,0), E, sm);\nlabel(\"$120^\\circ$\", (-1,1.73205081), SE, sm);\nlabel(\"$30^\\circ$\", (1,0.93205081), SE, sm);\nlabel(\"$x^\\circ$\", (0.8,1.53205081)-(0,0.2), S, sm);\nlabel(\"$z^\\circ$\", (0.9,1.73205081), SW, sm);\nlabel(\"$30^\\circ$\", (1,-0.93205081), NE, sm);\npair O=(1,1.73205081), Q=(1,-1.73205081), L=(-1,-1.73205081);\nlabel(\"$y^\\circ$\", L+(0.1,0.1), ENE, sm);\nlabel(\"$z^\\circ$\", L+(0,0.2), N, sm);\ndraw(rightanglemark(O,Q,L));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $n$ equal the number of sides in a regular polygon. For $3\\leq n < 10$, how many values of $n$ result in a regular polygon where the common degree measure of the interior angles is not an integer?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The number of degrees is the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$.  If the $n$-gon is regular, then each angle measures $\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$ degrees.  If $n=3$, 4, 5, 6, or 9, then $n$ divides evenly into 180, so the number of degrees in each angle is an integer.  If $n=7$, then the number of degrees is $180\\cdot5/7=900/7$, which is not an integer.  If $n=8$, the number of degrees in each angle is $180\\cdot 6/8=135$.  Therefore, only $\\boxed{1}$ value of $n$ between 3 and 9 results in a non-integer degree measure for each interior angle of a regular $n$-gon.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular polygon has exterior angles each measuring 15 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The measure of each exterior angle in a regular $n$-gon is $360/n$ degrees.  Setting this expression equal to 15, we find $n=\\boxed{24}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of square units in the area of the hexagon below?\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor = 4;\nint i,j;\nfor(i=0;i<=4;++i)\n\n{\n\nfor(j=-3;j<=3;++j)\n\n{\n\ndot((i,j));\n\n}\n\n}\n\nfor(i=1;i<=4;++i)\n\n{\n\ndraw((i,-1/3)--(i,1/3));\n\n}\nfor(j=1;j<=3;++j)\n\n{\n\ndraw((-1/3,j)--(1/3,j));\n\ndraw((-1/3,-j)--(1/3,-j));\n\n}\n\nreal eps = 0.2;\n\ndraw((3,3.5+eps)--(3,3.5-eps));\ndraw((4,3.5+eps)--(4,3.5-eps));\ndraw((3,3.5)--(4,3.5));\n\nlabel(\"1 unit\",(3.5,4));\n\ndraw((4.5-eps,2)--(4.5+eps,2));\ndraw((4.5-eps,3)--(4.5+eps,3));\ndraw((4.5,2)--(4.5,3));\n\nlabel(\"1 unit\",(5.2,2.5));\n\ndraw((-1,0)--(5,0));\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,4));\ndraw((0,0)--(1,3)--(3,3)--(4,0)--(3,-3)--(1,-3)--cycle,linewidth(2));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each of the four shaded triangles in the diagram below has area $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(3)=\\frac{3}{2}$ square units, and the shaded triangles along with the hexagon form a rectangular region whose area is $6\\cdot4=24$ square units.
