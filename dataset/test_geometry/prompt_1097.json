    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Five identical rectangles are arranged to form a larger rectangle $PQRS$, as shown.  The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]\nreal x = 1; real w = 2/3;\n\n// Draw outer square and labels\npair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);\ndraw(s--r--q--p--cycle);\nlabel(\"$S$\", s, SW); label(\"$R$\", r, SE); label(\"$Q$\", q, NE); label(\"$P$\", p, NW);\n\n// Draw other segments\ndraw((x, 0)--(x, w));\ndraw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));\ndraw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));\n\n// length labels\npair upper = (-0.1, x + w);\npair lower = (-0.1, w);\ndraw(lower--upper);\ndraw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));\ndraw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));\nlabel(\"$x$\", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);\n\npair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);\ndraw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));\ndraw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));\ndraw(left--right);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (x/2, -0.1), S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\\left(\\frac{2}{3}x\\right)=\\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\\left(\\frac{2}{3}x^2\\right)=4000$$ or $$\\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \\approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\\boxed{35}.$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The diagram shows a rectangle that has been dissected into nine non-overlapping squares. Given that the width and the height of the rectangle are relatively prime positive integers, find the perimeter of the rectangle.\n[asy]draw((0,0)--(69,0)--(69,61)--(0,61)--(0,0));draw((36,0)--(36,36)--(0,36)); draw((36,33)--(69,33));draw((41,33)--(41,61));draw((25,36)--(25,61)); draw((34,36)--(34,45)--(25,45)); draw((36,36)--(36,38)--(34,38)); draw((36,38)--(41,38)); draw((34,45)--(41,45));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Call the squares' side lengths from smallest to largest $a_1,\\ldots,a_9$, and let $l,w$ represent the dimensions of the rectangle.\nThe picture shows that\\begin{align*} a_1+a_2 &= a_3\\\\ a_1 + a_3 &= a_4\\\\ a_3 + a_4 &= a_5\\\\ a_4 + a_5 &= a_6\\\\ a_2 + a_3 + a_5 &= a_7\\\\ a_2 + a_7 &= a_8\\\\ a_1 + a_4 + a_6 &= a_9\\\\ a_6 + a_9 &= a_7 + a_8.\\end{align*}\nExpressing all terms 3 to 9 in terms of $a_1$ and $a_2$ and substituting their expanded forms into the previous equation will give the expression $5a_1 = 2a_2$.\nWe can guess that $a_1 = 2$. (If we started with $a_1$ odd, the resulting sides would not be integers and we would need to scale up by a factor of $2$ to make them integers; if we started with $a_1 > 2$ even, the resulting dimensions would not be relatively prime and we would need to scale down.) Then solving gives $a_9 = 36$, $a_6=25$, $a_8 = 33$, which gives us $l=61,w=69$. These numbers are relatively prime, as desired. The perimeter is $2(61)+2(69)=\\boxed{260}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The graph of the equation $9x+223y=2007$ is drawn on graph paper with each square representing one unit in each direction. How many of the $1$ by $1$ graph paper squares have interiors lying entirely below the graph and entirely in the first quadrant?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are $223 \\cdot 9 = 2007$ squares in total formed by the rectangle with edges on the x and y axes and with vertices on the intercepts of the equation, since the intercepts of the lines are $(223,0),\\ (0,9)$.\nCount the number of squares that the diagonal of the rectangle passes through. Since the two diagonals of a rectangle are congruent, we can consider instead the diagonal $y = \\frac{223}{9}x$. This passes through 8 horizontal lines ($y = 1 \\ldots 8$) and 222 vertical lines ($x = 1 \\ldots 222$). At every time we cross a line, we enter a new square. Since 9 and 223 are relatively prime, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to worry about crossing an intersection of a horizontal and vertical line at one time. We must also account for the first square. This means that it passes through $222 + 8 + 1 = 231$ squares.\nThe number of non-diagonal squares is $2007 - 231 = 1776$. Divide this in 2 to get the number of squares in one of the triangles, with the answer being $\\frac{1776}2 = \\boxed{888}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of rectangle $ABCD$ with vertices $A$(0, 0), $B$(0, 4), $C$($x$, 4) and $D$($x$, 0) is 28 square units. If $x > 0$, what is the value of $x$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the points, we see that the dimensions of the rectangle are $x$ and $4$.  The area of the rectangle is $(\\text{length})(\\text{width})=4x$, so $4x=28$ and $x=\\boxed{7}$.

What is the value of $y$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First we write the rectangle's side lengths in terms of the coordinates provided. The length is $7-(-1)=8$ and the height is $y-3.$ It follows that $8(y-3)=72,$ and $y=\\boxed{12}.$ [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(4cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nxaxis(Arrows(4));\nyaxis(ymin=-2,Arrows(4));\npair A=(-1,12), B=(7,12), C=(-1,3), D=(7,3);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--D--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$8$\",(A+B)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$y-3$\",(B+D)/2,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle whose vertices are at $(4, -1)$, $(10, 3)$ and $(4, 5)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$.  Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two rectangles have integer dimensions, and both have a perimeter of 144 cm. What is the greatest possible difference between the areas of two such rectangles?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the dimensions of the rectangle be $l$ and $w$.  We are given $2l+2w=144$, which implies $l+w=72$.  Solving for $w$, we have $w=72-l$.  The area of the rectangle is $lw=l(72-l)$.  As a function of $l$, this expression is a parabola whose zeros are at $l=0$ and $l=72$ (see graph).  The $y$-coordinate of a point on the parabola is maximized when the $x$-coordinate is chosen as close to the $x$-coordinate of the vertex as possible.  The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the zeros at $x=(0+72)/2=36$, so the maximum area is $(36)(36)=1296$ square units.  Similarly, to minimize the area we choose the length to be as far from $36$ as possible.  The resulting dimensions are $1$ unit and $71$ units, so the minimum area is 71 square units.  The difference between 1296 square units and 71 square units is $\\boxed{1225}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nsize(150,IgnoreAspect);\nreal f(real x)\n{\n\nreturn x*(15-x);\n}\nxaxis(Arrows(4));\nyaxis(ymax=f(7.5),Arrows(4));\ndraw(graph(f,-3,18),Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"Area\",(0,f(7.5)),N);\nlabel(\"$l$\",(18,0),S);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle in a Cartesian coordinate plane has vertices (5, -2), (10, 5) and (5, 5). How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the given points in a coordinate plane, we find that the triangle is a right triangle whose legs have length $5-(-2)=7$ and $10-5=5$ units.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(7)(5)=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(8));\ndotfactor = 4;\ndraw((-1,0)--(10,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,10),Arrows(4));\npair A=(5,-2), B=(10,5), C=(5,5);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(rotate(90)*\"$5-(-2)$\",(0,0.2)+(A+C)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$10-5$\",(B+C)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$(5,-2)$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$(10,5)$\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"$(5,5)$\",C,NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Any five points are taken inside or on a square with side length $1$. Let a be the smallest possible number with the property that it is always possible to select one pair of points from these five such that the distance between them is equal to or less than $a$. Then $a$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\sqrt{3}/3\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{2}/2\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 2\\sqrt{2}/3\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 1 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\sqrt{2}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Partition the unit square into four smaller squares of sidelength $\\frac{1}{2}$. Each of the five points lies in one of these squares, and so by the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists two points in the same $\\frac{1}{2}\\times \\frac{1}{2}$ square - the maximum possible distance between them being $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$ by Pythagoras.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An equilateral triangle has two vertices at $(0,5)$ and $(8,5)$. If the third vertex is in the first quadrant, what is the y-coordinate? Express your answer in simplest radical form. [asy]\ndraw((-1,0)--(11,0),Arrows);\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,12),Arrows);\nfor(int i=0;i<11;++i)\n{draw((i,-0.1)--(i,0.1));}\nfor(int j=0;j<11;++j)\n{draw((-0.1,j)--(0.1,j));}\ndot((0,5));\ndot((8,5));\nlabel(\"(0,5)\",(0,5),W);\ndraw((0,5)--(8,5));\nlabel(\"(8,5)\",(8,5),E);\nsize(6cm);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To begin this problem, we first notice that the side length of this equilateral triangle is $8$ (the distance between the two points given). We then consider the altitude of an equilateral triangle with side length $8$. If we draw an equilateral triangle and its altitude, we notice that the altitude splits the equilateral triangle into two $30-60-90$ triangles with the side length being the hypotenuse of these triangles. In our case, the hypotenuse of the $30-60-90$ triangle has length $8$, so the altitude (the side opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle) has length $4\\sqrt{3}$ because the side lengths of a $30-60-90$ triangle are related in the ratio $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$.\n\nSince the base of the equilateral triangle is at a $y$-coordinate of $5$ and $4\\sqrt{3}>5$, for the third vertex to be in the first quadrant, its $y$ coordinate must be $5$ $+ $ the altitude of the equilateral triangle. The third vertex has a $y$-coordinate of $\\boxed{5+4\\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Consider the rectangle with vertices at $(5,4),$ $(5,-4),$ $(-5,4),$ $(-5,-4)$.
