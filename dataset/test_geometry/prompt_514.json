    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a given sphere is $36\\pi$ cubic inches. How many square inches are in its surface area? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Here, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=36\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\\pi(3^2)=\\boxed{36\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume, in cubic inches, of a rectangular box, whose faces have areas of $24$ square inches, $16$ square inches and $6$ square inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular box, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=24$, $wh=16$, and $lh=6$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=24\\cdot16\\cdot6=2^3\\cdot3\\cdot2^4\\cdot2\\cdot3=2^8\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^4\\cdot3=\\boxed{48}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cones with radius 12 cm and height 12 cm are enclosed within a cylinder. The base of each cone is a base of the cylinder, and the height of the cylinder is 24 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cylinder not occupied by the cones? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylinder has volume $\\pi (12)^2 (24)$ cubic cm.  Each cone has volume $(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12)$ cubic cm.  Hence the volume of the space in the cylinder not occupied by the cones is  \\begin{align*}\n\\pi (12)^2 (24) - (2)(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12) &= 12^3\\pi(2-2/3)\\\\\n&=12^3\\pi(4/3)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{2304\\pi} \\text{ cubic cm}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is $SA = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh,$ where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. A particular solid right cylinder of radius 2 feet has a total surface area of $12\\pi$ square feet. What is the height of this cylinder?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the cylinder be $h$; we then have \\[SA = 2\\pi (2^2)+2\\pi (2)(h) = 12\\pi.\\]Solving yields $4\\pi h = 4 \\pi$ so $h = \\boxed{1}$ foot.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube, and the cube has a surface area of 24 square meters. A second cube is then inscribed within the sphere. What is the surface area in square meters of the inner cube?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the surface area of the original cube is 24 square meters, each face of the cube has a surface area of $24/6 = 4$ square meters, and the side length of this cube is 2  meters. The sphere inscribed within the cube has diameter 2 meters,  which is also the length of the diagonal of the cube inscribed in the sphere. Let $l$ represent the side length of the inscribed cube. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice gives \\[\nl^2 + l^2 + l^2 = 2^2 = 4.\n\\]Hence each face has surface area \\[\nl^2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\ \\text{square meters}.\n\\]So the surface area of the inscribed cube is $6\\cdot (4/3) = \\boxed{8}$ square meters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylinder with a height of 5 inches has a radius of 2 inches. What is the area of the curved surface of the cylinder, in square inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The lateral area of a cylinder is $2\\pi rh$. Since $h = 5$ and $r = 2$, our answer is $2\\pi\\cdot 2\\cdot 5 = \\boxed{20\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cylinder formed by rotating a square with side length 14 centimeters about its vertical line of symmetry. Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(100);\ndraw((-5,-.2)--(-3,-.2)--(-3,1.8)--(-5,1.8)--cycle); label(\"14\",((-3,1.8)--(-5,1.8)),N); label(\"14\",((-5,-.2)--(-5,1.8)),W);\ndraw((-2.5,.9)--(-1.5,.9),EndArrow);\nimport solids; import three; currentprojection = orthographic(5,0,2);\nrevolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), 1, 2);\ndraw((0,-1,2)--(0,1,2)); label(\"14\",((0,-1,2)--(0,1,2)),N); label(\"14\",(0,1,1),E);\ndraw(c,black);\n[/asy]\n\nRotating the square about its vertical line of symmetry creates a right circular cylinder with diameter 14 and height 14.  Thus, the cylinder has radius $14/2=7$ and volume $\\pi(7^2)(14)=\\pi(50-1)(14)=\\pi(700-14)=\\boxed{686\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Increasing the radius of a cylinder by $6$ units increased the volume by $y$ cubic units. Increasing the height of the cylinder by $6$ units also increases the volume by $y$ cubic units. If the original height is $2$, then the original radius is:\n$\\text{(A) } 2 \\qquad \\text{(B) } 4 \\qquad \\text{(C) } 6 \\qquad \\text{(D) } 6\\pi \\qquad \\text{(E) } 8$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that the volume of a cylinder is equal to $\\pi r^2h$, where $r$ and $h$ are the radius and height, respectively. So we know that $2\\pi (r+6)^2-2\\pi r^2=y=\\pi r^2(2+6)-2\\pi r^2$. Expanding and rearranging, we get that $2\\pi (12r+36)=6\\pi r^2$. Divide both sides by $6\\pi$ to get that $4r+12=r^2$, and rearrange to see that $r^2-4r-12=0$. This factors to become $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=6$ or $r=-2$. Obviously, the radius cannot be negative, so our answer is $\\boxed{6}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone has a volume of $12\\pi$ cubic centimeters. The height of the cone is 4 cm. How many centimeters is the circumference of the base of the cone, in terms of $\\pi$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. We're given that the volume is $12\\pi$ and the height is $4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 = 12\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$. Therefore, the circumference of the base is $2\\pi r = \\boxed{6\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Either increasing the radius or the height of a cylinder by six inches will result in the same volume. The original height of the cylinder is two inches. What is the original radius in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the original radius be $r$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased radius is $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased height is $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Since we are told these two volumes are the same, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2 = \\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Simplifying, we have $(r+6)^2=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2+12r+36=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2-4r-12=0$. Factoring, we have $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=\\boxed{6}$ (it cannot be negative because it is a physical length).\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius, in inches, of a right circular cylinder if the lateral surface area is $24\\pi$ square inches and the volume is $24\\pi$ cubic inches?\n\nAnswer:\n",
