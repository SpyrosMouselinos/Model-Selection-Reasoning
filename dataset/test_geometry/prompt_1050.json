    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A round pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick and has a diameter of 12 inches. It is cut into 12 congruent pieces. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one piece? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The entire pizza has radius 6 inches and volume $\\pi (6^2)(1/3) = 12\\pi$ cubic inches.  One slice has 1/12th this volume, or $\\boxed{\\pi}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Brad has a cylindrical barrel with radius 10 inches and height 15 inches.  He wants to fill it from a well, using a bucket in the shape of a hemisphere with a radius of 10 inches. How many trips must Brad make to the well in order to fill the barrel?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We start by finding the volume of the bucket and the volume of the barrel.  Let $r$ be ten inches.   The bucket is half of a sphere of radius $r$, so the volume it can hold is \\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3 . \\]On the other hand, the barrel is a cylinder of radius $r$ and height $15 \\text{ in} = \\frac{3}{2} r$, so its volume is \\[ \\pi r^2 \\cdot \\text{height} = \\frac{3}{2} \\pi r^3 . \\]Therefore the ratio of the volume of the barrel to the volume of the bucket is \\[ \\frac{(3/2) \\pi r^3}{(2/3) \\pi r^3} = \\frac{9}{4}\n= 2 + \\frac{1}{4} . \\]Thus two buckets will not suffice to fill the barrel, but three will, so Brad needs $\\boxed{3}$ trips to the well.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Kadin makes a snowman by stacking snowballs of radius 2 inches, 3 inches, and 5 inches.  Assuming all his snowballs are spherical, what is the total volume of snow he uses, in cubic inches?  Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Thus, the snowballs with radius 2, 3, and 5 inches have volumes $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3)$, $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3^3)$, and $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(5^3)$ cubic inches respectively.  The total volume of snow used is thus  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3)+\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3^3)+\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(5^3)&=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3+3^3+5^3)\\\\\n&=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(8+27+125)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{640}{3}\\pi}.\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A bowling ball cannot weigh more than 16 pounds and must have a diameter of $8 \\frac{1}{2}$ inches. How many square inches are in the surface area of a bowling ball before the finger holes are drilled? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is \\[4\\pi r^2.\\]  The sphere in question has diameter $8\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{17}{2}$, radius $\\frac{17}{4}$, and surface area  \\[4\\pi\\left(\\frac{17}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{17^2}{4}\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{289\\pi}{4}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone is sliced into four pieces by planes parallel to its base, as shown in the figure. All of these pieces have the same height. What is the ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to the volume of the largest piece? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, w, x, y, z;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(.25,.75);\nC=(.5,1.5);\nD=(.75,2.25);\nE=(1,3);\nF=(1.25,2.25);\nG=(1.5,1.5);\nH=(1.75,.75);\nI=(2,0);\nw=(A+I)/2;\nx=(B+H)/2;\ny=(C+G)/2;\nz=(D+F)/2;\ndraw(ellipse(w, 1, .25));\ndraw(ellipse(x, .75, .1875));\ndraw(ellipse(y, .5, .125));\ndraw(ellipse(z, .25, .0625));\ndraw(A--E--I);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the smallest cone (the one on top) be $h$ and let the radius of the circular base of that cone be $r$. Consider the 4 cones in the diagram: the smallest one on top (cone A), the top 2 pieces (cone B), the top 3 pieces (cone C), and all 4 pieces together (cone D). Because each piece of the large cone has the same height as the smallest cone and the same angle and vertex at the top, each of the 4 cones is a dilation of the smaller cone at the top. In other words, all four cones are similar. Because cone B has height twice that of cone A, its circular base has twice the radius as that of A. Likewise, cone C has three times the height, and thus 3 times the radius, and cone D has 4 times the height and 4 times the radius. Thus, using the formula for the volume of a cone, we get  \\begin{align*}\nV_B&=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (2r)^2 (2h)=\\frac{8}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\\\\nV_C&=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (3r)^2 (3h)=\\frac{27}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\\\\nV_D&=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (4r)^2 (4h)=\\frac{64}{3} \\pi r^2 h \n\\end{align*}Looking at the diagram, we can see that the largest piece will be the volume of cone D minus that of cone C: \\[V_{1}=\\frac{64}{3} \\pi r^2 h-\\frac{27}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{64-27}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{37}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\]Also notice that the volume of the second largest piece is the volume of cone C minus that of cone B: \\[V_{2}=\\frac{27}{3} \\pi r^2 h-\\frac{8}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{27-8}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{19}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\]Thus, the ratio of the volume of the second largest piece to that of the largest piece is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{V_2}{V_1}=\\frac{\\frac{19}{3} \\pi r^2 h}{\\frac{37}{3} \\pi r^2 h} \n=\\frac{\\frac{19}{\\cancel{3}} \\cancel{\\pi} \\cancel{r^2} \\cancel{h}}{\\frac{37}{\\cancel{3}} \\cancel{\\pi} \\cancel{r^2} \\cancel{h}} \n=\\boxed{\\frac{19}{37}}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Amy and Belinda each roll a sheet of 6-inch by 8-inch paper to form a cylindrical tube. Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together without overlap. Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together without overlap. What is $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Amy's cylinder has a height of 8 and a base circumference of 6.  Let her cylinder have volume $V_A$ and radius $r_A$; we have $2\\pi r_A = 6$ so $r_A = 3/\\pi$ and $V_A = \\pi r_A ^2 h = \\pi (3/\\pi)^2 (8) = 72/\\pi$.\n\nBelinda's cylinder has a height of 6 and a base circumference of 8.  Similarly, let her cylinder have volume $V_B$ and radius $r_B$; we have $2\\pi r_B = 8$ so $r_B = 4/\\pi$ and $V_B = \\pi r_B^2 h = \\pi (4/\\pi)^2 (6) = 96/\\pi$.\n\nThe positive difference between the volume of the two tubes is $96/\\pi - 72/\\pi = 24/\\pi$ cubic inches; $\\pi$ times this difference is $\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot is filled full with chocolate.  All of the chocolate is then evenly distributed between 27 congruent, smaller hemisphere-shaped molds.  What is the radius of each of the smaller molds, in feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.  The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1^3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ cubic feet.\n\nLet each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$.  Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \\[27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A jar of peanut butter which is 3 inches in diameter and 4 inches high sells for $\\$$0.60. At the same rate, what would be the price for a jar that is 6 inches in diameter and 6 inches high?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The first jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{3}{2})^24=9\\pi$. The second jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{6}{2})^26=54\\pi$. Note that the volume of the second jar is 6 times greater than that of the first jar. Because peanut butter is sold by volume, the second jar will be six times more expensive than the first jar, for an answer of $\\$0.60\\times6=\\boxed{\\$3.60}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n At the MP Donut Hole Factory, Niraek, Theo, and Akshaj are coating spherical donut holes in powdered sugar.  Niraek's donut holes have radius 6 mm, Theo's donut holes have radius 8 mm, and Akshaj's donut holes have radius 10 mm.  All three workers coat the surface of the donut holes at the same rate and start at the same time.  Assuming that the powdered sugar coating has negligible thickness and is distributed equally on all donut holes, how many donut holes will Niraek have covered by the first time all three workers finish their current donut hole at the same time?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The amount of powdered sugar on a given donut hole is given by the surface area of the donut hole.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$, so Niraek's donut holes each have surface area $4\\pi \\cdot 6^2 = 144\\pi$ square millimeters.  Similarly, Theo's donut holes each have surface area $4\\pi \\cdot 8^2 = 256\\pi$ square millimeters and Akshaj's donut holes each have surface area $4\\pi \\cdot 10^2 = 400\\pi$ square millimeters.\n\nTo determine the amount of powdered sugar used the first time all three workers finish at the same time, we compute the lowest common multiple of $144\\pi$, $256\\pi$, and $400\\pi$. $144=2^4\\cdot 3^2$, $256=2^8$, and $400=2^4\\cdot 5^2$, so the desired LCM is $2^8\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^2\\pi$.  The number of donut holes Niraek will have covered by this point is $\\frac{2^8\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^2\\pi }{ 144\\pi }= 2^4\\cdot 5^2 = \\boxed{400}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cylindrical log has diameter $12$ inches. A wedge is cut from the log by making two planar cuts that go entirely through the log. The first is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, and the plane of the second cut forms a $45^\\circ$ angle with the plane of the first cut. The intersection of these two planes has exactly one point in common with the log. The number of cubic inches in the wedge can be expressed as $n\\pi$, where n is a positive integer. Find $n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of the wedge is half the volume of a cylinder with height $12$ and radius $6$. (Imagine taking another identical wedge and sticking it to the existing one). Thus, $V=\\dfrac{6^2\\cdot 12\\pi}{2}=216\\pi$, so $n=\\boxed{216}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Danny Henry made a waffle on his six-inch-diameter circular griddle using batter containing a half a cup of flour.
