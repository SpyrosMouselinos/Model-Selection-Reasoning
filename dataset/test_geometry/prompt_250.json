    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $ADE$ have areas $2007$ and $7002,$ respectively, with $B=(0,0), C=(223,0), D=(680,380),$ and $E=(689,389).$ What is the sum of all possible $x$-coordinates of $A$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $h$ be the length of the altitude from $A$ in $\\triangle ABC$. Then \\[\n2007=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot BC\\cdot h=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 223\\cdot h,\n\\]so $h=18$.  Thus $A$ is on one of the lines $y=18$ or $y=-18$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\npair B, C, D, E;\n\nB = (0,0);\nC = (2,0);\nD = (7,3);\nE = (8,4);\n\ndraw((-1.5,0.5)--(6,0.5),dashed);\ndraw((-1.5,-0.5)--(6,-0.5),dashed);\ndraw((2,2 - 4 + 0.5)--(8,8 - 4 + 0.5),dashed);\ndraw((3,3 - 4 - 0.5)--(9,9 - 4 - 0.5),dashed);\n\ndot(\"$B$\", B, W);\ndot(\"$C$\", C, dir(0));\ndot(\"$D$\", D, SW);\ndot(\"$E$\", E, NE);\ndot(extension((-1.5,0.5),(6,0.5),(2,2 - 4 + 0.5),(8,8 - 4 + 0.5)),red);\ndot(extension((-1.5,-0.5),(6,-0.5),(2,2 - 4 + 0.5),(8,8 - 4 + 0.5)),red);\ndot(extension((-1.5,0.5),(6,0.5),(3,3 - 4 - 0.5),(9,9 - 4 - 0.5)),red);\ndot(extension((-1.5,-0.5),(6,-0.5),(3,3 - 4 - 0.5),(9,9 - 4 - 0.5)),red);\n\nlabel(\"$y = 18$\", (-1.5,0.5), W);\nlabel(\"$y = -18$\", (-1.5,-0.5), W);\n[/asy]\n\nLine $DE$ has equation $x-y-300=0$.  Let $A$ have coordinates $(a,b)$. By the formula for the distance from a point to a line, the distance from $A$ to line $DE$ is $|a-b-300 |/\\sqrt{2}$.  The area of $\\triangle ADE$ is \\[\n7002=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{| a-b-300 |}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot DE\n=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{| a\\pm 18-300 |}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot 9\\sqrt{2}.\n\\]Thus $a=\\pm 18 \\pm 1556 + 300$, and the sum of the four possible values of $a$ is $4\\cdot300=\\boxed{1200}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Each vertex of this parallelogram has integer coordinates. The perimeter of this parallelogram is $p$ units, while the area is $a$ square units. What is the value of the sum $p + a$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(5cm,5cm);\ndraw((-2,0)--(11,0));\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,4)--(10,4)--(7,0)--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(3,4)$\",(3,4),NW);\nlabel(\"$(7,0)$\",(7,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the bottom side of the parallelogram is 7 units, and the length of the left side of the parallelogram is $\\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5$ units, by the Pythagorean theorem.  Since the opposite two sides are congruent to these two, the perimeter of the parallelogram is $5+7+5+7=24$ units.  The area of the parallelogram is equal to its base times its height, which is $(7)(4)=28$ square units.  Therefore, $p+a=24+28=\\boxed{52}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The nine points of this grid are equally spaced horizontally and vertically.  The distance between two neighboring points is 1 unit.  What is the area, in square units, of the region where the two triangles overlap?\n\n[asy]\nsize(80);\ndot((0,0)); dot((0,1));dot((0,2));dot((1,0));dot((1,1));dot((1,2));dot((2,0));dot((2,1));dot((2,2));\ndraw((0,0)--(2,1)--(1,2)--cycle, linewidth(0.6));\ndraw((2,2)--(0,1)--(1,0)--cycle, linewidth(0.6));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We color one of the triangles blue, and draw three blue segments connecting its points of intersection with the other triangle.    [asy]\nsize(80);\ndot((0,0)); dot((0,1));dot((0,2));dot((1,0));dot((1,1));dot((1,2));dot((2,0));dot((2,1));dot((2,2));\ndraw((0,0)--(2,1)--(1,2)--cycle, blue+linewidth(0.6));\ndraw((2,2)--(0,1)--(1,0)--cycle, linewidth(0.6));\ndraw((.666,.333)--(1.333,1.666), blue+linewidth(0.6));\ndraw((.333,.666)--(1.666,1.333), blue+linewidth(0.6));\ndraw((1.333,.666)--(.666,1.333), blue+linewidth(0.6));\n[/asy] Because of the symmetry inherent in the grid and the two triangles (which are both isosceles), these three blue segments divide the blue triangle into congruent smaller triangles.  The blue triangle contains 9 of these congruent smaller triangles.\n\nThe region of overlap of the two triangles is a hexagonal region.  As per the diagram above, this hexagonal region contains 6 of these congruent smaller triangles.  Thus, the area of the hexagonal region is $6/9=2/3$ of the area of one of the isosceles triangles.  We compute the area of one isosceles triangle as follows:\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(2,1)--(1,2)--cycle, linewidth(0.6));\nlabel(\"$A$\",2(0,0),SW); label(\"$B$\",2(1,0),SE); label(\"$C$\",2(1,1),NE); label(\"$D$\",2(0,1),NW); label(\"$E$\",2(.5,1),N); label(\"$F$\",2(1,.5),E);\n\n[/asy] Label points $A,B,C,D,E,F$ as above.  To compute the area of this triangle ($\\triangle AEF$), notice how it is equal to the area of square $ABCD$ minus the areas of triangles $\\triangle ADE$, $\\triangle ABF$, and $\\triangle ECF$.  The square has side length 2 units, so the area of $\\triangle ADE$ and $\\triangle ABF$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(2)(1) = 1$ and the area of $\\triangle ECF$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(1)=\\frac{1}{2}$.  The area of square $ABCD$ is $2^2=4$, so the area of triangle $\\triangle AEF$ is equal to $4 - 2(1) - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nFinally, remember that the hexagonal region has area $2/3$ of the area of the triangle, or $\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} = 1$.  Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of the interior region formed by the lines $y = 2x - 4, y = -3x +16$ and the $y$-axis?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To find the vertices of the triangle, we find where the two lines $y=2x-4$ and $y=-3x+16$ intersect. Solving $2x-4=-3x+16$, we get $x=4$.  Substituting $x=4$ back into $y=2x-4$, we find $y=4$.  Therefore, $(4,4)$ is one of the vertices of the triangle.  The other two vertices are the $y$-intercepts of the two lines, namely $(0,16)$ and $(0,-4)$.  Taking the side joining $(0,16)$ and $(0,-4)$ as the base of the triangle, we find that the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(16-(-4))(4)=\\boxed{40}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(3mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=4;\n\nfill((0,-4)--(0,16)--(4,4)--cycle,gray);\n\ndraw((-2,0)--(5,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-5)--(0,18),Arrows(4));\n\ndraw((0,-4)--(4,4));\ndraw((0,16)--(4,4)); [/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The rectangle with vertices $(-1, y), (7, y), (-1, 3)$, and $(7, 3)$ has an area of 72 square units, and $y$ is positive. What is the value of $y$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First we write the rectangle's side lengths in terms of the coordinates provided. The length is $7-(-1)=8$ and the height is $y-3.$ It follows that $8(y-3)=72,$ and $y=\\boxed{12}.$ [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(4cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nxaxis(Arrows(4));\nyaxis(ymin=-2,Arrows(4));\npair A=(-1,12), B=(7,12), C=(-1,3), D=(7,3);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--D--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$8$\",(A+B)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$y-3$\",(B+D)/2,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of triangle $ABC$?

The area of rectangle $CDEF$ is the sum of the areas of the four triangles $BEA$, $BFC$, $CDA$, and $ABC$.  The areas of the first three triangles may be found directly using the area formula $\\frac{1}{2}$(base)(height).  The area of triangle $ABC$ is the area of the rectangle minus the areas of the three other triangles: $8\\cdot6-\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot4\\cdot3-\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot6\\cdot5-\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot2\\cdot8=\\boxed{19}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.15inch);\npath X = (-6.5, 0)--(5.5, 0);\npath Y = (0, -3.5)--(0, 7.5);\ndraw(X); draw(Y);\n\nfor(int n=-6; n <= 5; ++n)\nif( n != 0 )\ndraw( (n,0.25)--(n,-0.25) );\nfor(int n=-3; n <= 7; ++n)\nif( n != 0 )\ndraw( (0.25,n)--(-0.25,n) );\n\npair A = (-4,3); pair B = (0,6); pair C = (2,-2);\npair D = (-4,-2); pair E = (-4,6); pair F = (2,6);\ndot(A); dot(B); dot(C);\ndot(D);dot(E);dot(F);\nlabel(\"$A\\ (-4,3)$\", A, NW); label(\"$B\\ (0,6)$\", B, NE); label(\"$C\\ (2,-2)$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,SW); label(\"$E$\",E,NW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,SE);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--D--E--F--cycle);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The shaded region consists of 16 congruent squares.

Clearly, that square would be formed of 9 of the shaded squares.  The formula for the area of a square from its diagonal is $A = \\frac{d^2}{2}$, therefore, the area of that imaginary square is 18.  Thus, each smaller shaded square has area 2, making for a total of $\\boxed{32\\text{ square cm}}$ for the entire shaded area.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a 5 by 5 grid, each of the 25 small squares measures 2 cm by 2 cm and is shaded. Five unshaded circles are then placed on top of the grid as shown. The area of the visible shaded region can be written in the form $A-B\\pi$ square cm. What is the value $A+B$?\n\n[asy]\nfor(int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n\nfor(int j = 0; j < 5; ++j)\n\n{\n\nfilldraw((i,j)--(i+1,j)--(i+1,j+1)--(i,j+1)--(i,j)--cycle,gray,linewidth(2));\n\n}\n}\n\nfilldraw(circle((2.5,.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\nfilldraw(circle((4.5,2.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\nfilldraw(circle((2.5,4.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\nfilldraw(circle((.5,2.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\n\nfilldraw(circle((2.5,2.5),1.5),white,linewidth(2));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The area of the visible shaded region is equal to the area of the grid minus the area of the five circles. The diameter of the four smaller circles is equal to a side of a small square, or 2 cm, so the radius of each of the smaller circles is 1 cm. The area of all four circles is then $4\\cdot\\pi \\cdot1^2=4\\pi$. The diameter of the large circle is equal to the length of three sides of a small square, or 6 cm, so the radius of the large circle is 3 cm. The area of the large circle is then $\\pi\\cdot 3^2 = 9\\pi$. Each side of the grid measures $5\\cdot2=10$ cm, so the area of the grid is $10\\cdot10=100$. The area of the visible shaded region is thus $100-4\\pi-9\\pi=100-13\\pi$ square cm. So $A=100$, $B=13$, and $A+B=100+13=\\boxed{113}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle whose vertices are at $(4, -1)$, $(10, 3)$ and $(4, 5)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$.  Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The points $(1, 7), (13, 16)$ and $(5, k)$, where $k$ is an integer, are vertices of a triangle. What is the sum of the values of $k$ for which the area of the triangle is a minimum?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We begin by finding the equation of the line $\\ell$ containing $(1,7)$ and $(13,16)$. The slope of $\\ell$ is $\\frac{16-7}{13-1} = \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac 34$, so the line has the point-slope form $y - 7 = \\frac 34 (x - 1)$. Substituting the value $x = 5$, we obtain that $y = 7 + \\frac 34 (5-1) = 10$. It follows that the point $(5,10)$ lies on the line containing $(1,7)$ and $(13,16)$ (for $k = 10$, we obtain a degenerate triangle). To minimize the area of the triangle, it follows that $k$ must either be equal to $9$ or $11$.\n\nIndeed, we claim that both such triangles have the same area. Dropping the perpendiculars from $(5,9)$ and $(5,11)$ to $\\ell$, we see that the perpendiculars, $\\ell$, and the line segment connecting $(5,9)$ to $(5,11)$ form two right triangles. By vertical angles, they are similar, and since they both have a hypotenuse of length $1$, they must be congruent. Then, the height of both triangles must be the same, so both $k = 9$ and $k = 11$ yield triangles with minimal area. The answer is $9 + 11 = \\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The grid below contains the $16$ points whose $x$- and $y$-coordinates are in the set $\\{0,1,2,3\\}$: [asy]\nsize(2.5cm);\nfor(int i=0; i<4; i+=1) { for(int j=0; j<4; j+=1) { dot((i,j)); }; };\n[/asy] A square with all four of its vertices among these $16$ points has area $A$. What is the sum of all possible values of $A$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
