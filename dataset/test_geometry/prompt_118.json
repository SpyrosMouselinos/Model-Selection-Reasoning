    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A bowling ball is a solid ball with a spherical surface and diameter 30 cm. To custom fit a bowling ball for each bowler, three holes are drilled in the ball. Bowler Kris has holes drilled that are 8 cm deep and have diameters of 2 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm. Assuming the three holes are right circular cylinders, find the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the fitted bowling ball. Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The untampered bowling ball has radius $30/2=15$ cm and volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(15^3)=4\\cdot 15^2\\cdot 5\\pi=225\\cdot 20\\pi = 4500\\pi\\] cubic cm.  The 2 cm cylindrical holes each have radius $2/2=1$ cm and volume \\[\\pi (1^2)(8)=8\\pi\\] cubic cm; the 3 cm cylindrical hole has radius $3/2$ cm and volume \\[\\pi\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2(8)=9\\cdot 2 \\pi = 18\\pi\\] cubic cm.  Post hole-removal the fitted ball has volume \\[4500\\pi - 2\\cdot 8\\pi - 18\\pi = \\boxed{4466\\pi}\\] cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A bowling ball cannot weigh more than 16 pounds and must have a diameter of $8 \\frac{1}{2}$ inches. How many square inches are in the surface area of a bowling ball before the finger holes are drilled? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is \\[4\\pi r^2.\\]  The sphere in question has diameter $8\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{17}{2}$, radius $\\frac{17}{4}$, and surface area  \\[4\\pi\\left(\\frac{17}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{17^2}{4}\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{289\\pi}{4}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. What is the ratio of the volume of the inscribed sphere to the volume of the cube? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(60);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nLet the side length of the cube be $s$.  The side length of the cube is equal to diameter of the inscribed sphere, so the radius of the sphere has length $\\frac{s}{2}$.  Thus, the volume of the sphere is equal to $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{\\pi s^3}{6}$ and the volume of the cube is equal to $s^3$.  Hence the ratio of the sphere's volume to the cube's volume is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A ball was floating in a lake when the lake froze. The ball was removed (without breaking the ice), leaving a hole $24$ cm across as the top and $8$ cm deep. What was the radius of the ball (in centimeters)?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 8 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 12 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 13 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 8\\sqrt{3} \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 6\\sqrt{6}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Consider a cross-section of this problem in which a circle lies with its center somewhere above a line. A line segment of $8$ cm can be drawn from the line to the bottom of the ball. Denote the distance between the center of the circle and the line as $x$. We can construct a right triangle by dragging the center of the circle to the intersection of the circle and the line. We then have the equation $x^2+(12)^2=(x+8)^2$, $x^2+144=x^2+16x+64$. Solving, the answer is $\\boxed{13}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is cut into four congruent wedges. The circumference of the sphere is $12\\pi$ inches. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one wedge? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the sphere.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sphere's radius be $r$.  From the sphere's circumference we have $2\\pi r = 12\\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r = 6$.  The volume of the sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6^3) = 36\\cdot 8 \\pi$.  The volume of one wedge is one-fourth this volume, or $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 6^2\\cdot 8 \\pi = 6^2\\cdot 2\\pi = \\boxed{72\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A large sphere has a volume of $288\\pi$ cubic units.  A smaller sphere has a volume which is $12.5\\%$ of the volume of the larger sphere.  What is the ratio of the radius of the smaller sphere to the radius of the larger sphere? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that the two spheres are similar (in the same sense that triangles are similar) because corresponding parts are in proportion. We will prove that for two spheres that are similar in the ratio $1:k$, their volumes have the ratio $1:k^3$. Let the radius of the first sphere be $r$, so the radius of the other sphere is $kr$. The volume of the first sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the volume of the second sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (kr)^3$. The ratio between the two volumes is  \\[\\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (kr)^3}=\\frac{r^3}{k^3r^3}=\\frac{1}{k^3}\\] Thus, the ratio of the volumes of the two spheres is $1:k^3$.\n\nIn this problem, since the smaller sphere has $12.5\\%=\\frac{1}{8}$ of the volume of the larger sphere, the radius is $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{8}}=\\frac{1}{2}$ that of the larger sphere. Thus, the ratio between the two radii is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n(In general, the ratio of the volumes of two similar 3-D shapes is the cube of the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides.)\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot is filled full with chocolate.  All of the chocolate is then evenly distributed between 27 congruent, smaller hemisphere-shaped molds.  What is the radius of each of the smaller molds, in feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.  The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1^3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ cubic feet.\n\nLet each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$.  Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \\[27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A 6 cm by 8 cm rectangle is inscribed in a circle. What is the number of centimeters in the circumference of the circle?

By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the diagonal is $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$ centimeters.  Also, by symmetry the diagonal of the rectangle is a diameter of the circle.  The circumference of the circle is $\\pi\\times (\\text{diameter})=\\boxed{10\\pi}$ centimeters.

Given that one edge of the cube is 6 inches, how many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(70);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy] A sphere inscribed in a cube has diameter length equal to the side length of the cube.  Thus, the inscribed sphere has diameter 6 inches, radius $6/2=3$ inches, and volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3)^3=4\\cdot 3^2\\pi=\\boxed{36\\pi}\\] cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circular sheet of paper with radius of $6$ cm is cut into three congruent sectors. What is the height of the cone in centimeters that can be created by rolling one of the sections until the edges meet? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The circumference of the whole circle is $2 \\pi \\cdot 6 = 12 \\pi$, so the circumference of the base of the cone is $12 \\pi/3 = 4 \\pi$.  Hence, the radius of the base of the cone is $4 \\pi/(2 \\pi) = 2$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\nfill((0,0)--arc((0,0),1,-60,60)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1));\ndraw((0,0)--dir(60));\ndraw((0,0)--dir(180));\ndraw((0,0)--dir(300));\nlabel(\"$6$\", dir(60)/2, NW);\n[/asy]\n\nThe slant height of the cone is 6 (the radius of the original circle), so by Pythagoras, the height of the cone is $\\sqrt{6^2 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{32} = \\boxed{4 \\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.8 cm);\n\ndraw((-2,0)--(2,0)--(0,4*sqrt(2))--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,4*sqrt(2)));\n\nlabel(\"$2$\", (1,0), S);\nlabel(\"$6$\", (1,2*sqrt(2)), NE);\nlabel(\"$4 \\sqrt{2}$\", (0,0.7*2*sqrt(2)), W);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Golf balls are packaged by stacking three balls vertically in a box.
