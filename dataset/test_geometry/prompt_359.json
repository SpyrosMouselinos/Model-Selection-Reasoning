    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The formula for the total surface area of a cylinder is $SA = 2\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi rh,$ where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. A particular solid right cylinder of radius 2 feet has a total surface area of $12\\pi$ square feet. What is the height of this cylinder?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the cylinder be $h$; we then have \\[SA = 2\\pi (2^2)+2\\pi (2)(h) = 12\\pi.\\]Solving yields $4\\pi h = 4 \\pi$ so $h = \\boxed{1}$ foot.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylinder with a height of 5 inches has a radius of 2 inches. What is the area of the curved surface of the cylinder, in square inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The lateral area of a cylinder is $2\\pi rh$. Since $h = 5$ and $r = 2$, our answer is $2\\pi\\cdot 2\\cdot 5 = \\boxed{20\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Either increasing the radius or the height of a cylinder by six inches will result in the same volume. The original height of the cylinder is two inches. What is the original radius in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the original radius be $r$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased radius is $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased height is $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Since we are told these two volumes are the same, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2 = \\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Simplifying, we have $(r+6)^2=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2+12r+36=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2-4r-12=0$. Factoring, we have $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=\\boxed{6}$ (it cannot be negative because it is a physical length).\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When the height of a cylinder is doubled and its radius is increased by $200\\%$, the cylinder's volume is multiplied by a factor of $X$. What is the value of $X$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylinder's original volume is $\\pi r^2h$. The new height is $2h$ and the new radius is $r+\\frac{200}{100}r=3r$. That means the new volume is $\\pi (3r)^2(2h)=\\pi r^2h(9)(2)$. The new volume is the original volume multiplied by a factor of $\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a given sphere is $36\\pi$ cubic inches. How many square inches are in its surface area? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Here, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=36\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\\pi(3^2)=\\boxed{36\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The surface area of a particular sphere is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cylinder with its diameter equal to its height is inscribed in a right circular cone. The cone has diameter 10 and altitude 12, and the axes of the cylinder and cone coincide. Find the radius of the cylinder. Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cylinder have radius $r$ and height $2r$. Since $\\triangle APQ$ is similar to $\\triangle AOB$, we have $$\\frac{12-2r}{r} = \\frac{12}{5}, \\text{ so } r = \\boxed{\\frac{30}{11}}.$$[asy]\ndraw((0,2)..(-6,0)--(6,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,-2)..(-6,0)--(6,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,1)..(-3,0)--(3,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,-1)..(-3,0)--(3,0)..cycle);\nfill((-6,0.01)--(-6,-0.01)--(6,-0.01)--(6,0.01)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,14)--(0,0)--(6,0),dashed);\ndraw((0,8)..(-3,7)--(3,7)..cycle);\ndraw((0,6)..(-3,7)--(3,7)..cycle);\nfill((-3,7.01)--(-3,6.99)--(3,6.99)--(3,7.01)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,7)--(3,7),dashed);\ndraw((-6,0)--(0,14)--(6,0));\ndraw((-3,0)--(-3,7));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,7));\nlabel(\"{\\tiny O}\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny B}\",(6,0),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny P}\",(0,7),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny Q}\",(3,7),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny A}\",(0,14),E);\ndraw((0,-2.5)--(6,-2.5),Arrows);\ndraw((-6.5,0)--(-6.5,14),Arrows);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 5}\",(3,-2.5),S);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12}\",(-6.5,7),W);\ndraw((10,0)--(15,0)--(10,12)--cycle);\ndraw((10,6)--(12.5,6));\ndraw((15.5,0)--(15.5,12),Arrows);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny O}\",(10,0),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny P}\",(10,6),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny A}\",(10,12),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 2r}\",(10,3),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12-2r}\",(10,9),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny B}\",(15,0),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny Q}\",(12.5,6),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12}\",(15.5,6),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 5}\",(12.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Increasing the radius of a cylinder by $6$ units increased the volume by $y$ cubic units. Increasing the height of the cylinder by $6$ units also increases the volume by $y$ cubic units. If the original height is $2$, then the original radius is:\n$\\text{(A) } 2 \\qquad \\text{(B) } 4 \\qquad \\text{(C) } 6 \\qquad \\text{(D) } 6\\pi \\qquad \\text{(E) } 8$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that the volume of a cylinder is equal to $\\pi r^2h$, where $r$ and $h$ are the radius and height, respectively. So we know that $2\\pi (r+6)^2-2\\pi r^2=y=\\pi r^2(2+6)-2\\pi r^2$. Expanding and rearranging, we get that $2\\pi (12r+36)=6\\pi r^2$. Divide both sides by $6\\pi$ to get that $4r+12=r^2$, and rearrange to see that $r^2-4r-12=0$. This factors to become $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=6$ or $r=-2$. Obviously, the radius cannot be negative, so our answer is $\\boxed{6}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone has a volume of $12\\pi$ cubic centimeters. The height of the cone is 4 cm. How many centimeters is the circumference of the base of the cone, in terms of $\\pi$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. We're given that the volume is $12\\pi$ and the height is $4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 = 12\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$. Therefore, the circumference of the base is $2\\pi r = \\boxed{6\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The height of a right cylinder is 2.5 times its radius. If the surface area of the cylinder is $112\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$, what is the radius of the cylinder in centimeters?\n\nAnswer:\n",
