    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is inscribed in a circle of radius 3.  What is the area of the triangle? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$.  The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.  Thus $5x=2\\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$.  The area of the triangle is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3x\\cdot 4x =\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{18}{5}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}\n=\\frac{216}{25}=\\boxed{8.64}.\\]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle with sides of 5, 12, and 13 has both an inscribed and a circumscribed circle.  What is the distance between the centers of those circles?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the triangle so that $AB = 5$, $AC = 12$, and $BC = 13$.  Let $I$ and $O$ be the incenter and circumcenter of triangle $ABC$, respectively.  Let the incircle of triangle $ABC$ be tangent to sides $BC$, $AC$, and $AB$ at $D$, $E$, and $F$, respectively.\n\n[asy]\nimport geometry;\n\nunitsize(0.4 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, I, O;\n\nA = (5^2/13,5*12/13);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (13,0);\nI = incenter(A,B,C);\nD = (I + reflect(B,C)*(I))/2;\nE = (I + reflect(C,A)*(I))/2;\nF = (I + reflect(A,B)*(I))/2;\nO = (B + C)/2;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(incircle(A,B,C));\ndraw(I--D);\ndraw(I--E);\ndraw(I--F);\ndraw(I--O);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\ndot(\"$D$\", D, S);\ndot(\"$E$\", E, NE);\ndot(\"$F$\", F, NW);\ndot(\"$I$\", I, N);\ndot(\"$O$\", O, S);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle BAC = 90^\\circ$, the circumcenter $O$ of triangle $ABC$ is the midpoint of hypotenuse $BC$.\n\nSince $AE$ and $AF$ are tangents from $A$ to the same circle, $AE = AF$.  Let $x = AE = AF$.  Similarly, let $y = BD = BF$ and $z = CD = CE$.  Then $x + y = AF + BF = AB = 5$, $x + z = AE + CE = AC = 12$, $y + z = BD + CD = BC = 13$.  Solving this system of equations, we find $x = 2$, $y = 3$, and $z = 10$.  Then $DO = BO - BD = BC/2 - y = 13/2 - 3 = 7/2$.\n\nThe inradius $r$ of triangle $ABC$ is given by $r = K/s$, where $K$ is the area of triangle $ABC$, and $s$ is the semi-perimeter.  We see that $K = [ABC] = 1/2 \\cdot AB \\cdot AC = 1/2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 12 = 30$, and $s = (AB + AC + BC)/2 = (5 + 12 + 13)/2 = 15$, so $r = 30/15 = 2$.\n\nHence, by the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $IDO$, \\[IO = \\sqrt{ID^2 + DO^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + \\left( \\frac{7}{2} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{65}{4}} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{2}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a triangle, the area is numerically equal to the perimeter. What is the radius of the inscribed circle?\n$\\text{(A) } 2\\quad \\text{(B) } 3\\quad \\text{(C) } 4\\quad \\text{(D) } 5\\quad \\text{(E) } 6$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n One of the most common formulas involving the inradius of a triangle is $A = rs$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle, $r$ is the inradius, and $s$ is the semiperimeter.\nThe problem states that $A = p = 2s$. This means $2s = rs$, or $r = \\boxed{2}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the diameter of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 11,$ $AC=6,$ and $BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $d$ be the diameter of the inscribed circle, and let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=12$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{12\\cdot 1\\cdot 6\\cdot 5} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{6^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 12,$$which yields the radius $r=\\frac {\\sqrt{10}}{2}$. This yields the diameter $d = \\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,5)$, and $(7,12)$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The base of the triangle lies on the $y$-axis, and is 5 units long. The height of the triangle is the horizontal distance from the point $(7,12)$ to the $y$-axis, and is 7 units long. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{5\\cdot7}{2}=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle with a radius of 2 units has its center at $(0, 0)$. A circle with a radius of 7 units has its center at $(15, 0)$. A line tangent to both circles intersects the $x$-axis at $(x, 0)$ to the right of the origin. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To begin, we can draw a diagram as shown: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,8)--(0,-8),linewidth(.5));\ndraw((-4,0)--(23,0),linewidth(.5));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2),linewidth(.7));\ndraw(Circle((15,0),7),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((-2,-4)--(14,8),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(1.3,-1.5),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((15,0)--(10.7,5.5),linewidth(.7));\nlabel(\"\\tiny{2}\",(-.5,-1));\nlabel(\"\\tiny{7}\",(14,3));\n[/asy] By drawing in radii to the tangent line, we have formed two right triangles, one with hypotenuse $x$ and the other with hypotenuse $15-x$.  Notice that the angles at the $x$ axis are vertical angles and are also congruent.  So, these two triangles are similar, and we can set up a ratio: $$\\frac{x}{15-x}=\\frac{2}{7}$$ $$7x=30-2x$$ $$9x=30$$ $$x=\\boxed{\\frac{10}{3}}$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 22, AC=12,$ and $BC=14$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=24$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24\\cdot 2\\cdot 12\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 24\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$24\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 24,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has sides of length 5, 12 and 13 units, and triangle $DEF$ has sides of length 8, 15 and 17 units. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $DEF$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are both right, since their sides form Pythagorean triples. It follows that the desired ratio is $\\dfrac{(5\\cdot 12)/2}{(8\\cdot 15)/2} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has vertices at $(-3,2),(6,-2),(3,5)$. How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(200);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nreal x = 7;\npair A=(-3,2), B=(6,-2), C=(3,5);\nfill(A--C--(-3,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(B--C--(6,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(A--B--(-3,-2)--cycle,gray(0.6));\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\nxaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\nyaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(-3,2)$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$(6,-2)$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$(3,5)$\",C,N);\ndraw((-3,5)--(6,5)--(6,-2)--(-3,-2)--cycle,dotted);[/asy] We find the area of the given triangle by subtracting the sum of the areas of the three shaded triangles in the figure from the area of the rectangle formed by all four triangles.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $9(7)=63$ square units, and the sum of the areas of the shaded triangles is $$\\frac{1}{2}(6)(3)+\\frac{1}{2}(3)(7)+\\frac{1}{2}(4)(9)=37.5$$ square units.  The area of the fourth triangle is $63-37.5=\\boxed{25.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 5, AC=6, BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=9$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{9\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{3^3\\cdot 2^3} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{6}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{6} = r\\cdot 9,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle with sides measuring 8, 15 and 17 units is inscribed in a circle.
