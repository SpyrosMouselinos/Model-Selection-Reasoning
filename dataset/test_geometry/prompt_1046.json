    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two sides of a triangle measure 4 cm and 9 cm. What is the greatest integer number of centimeters that could be the third side of this triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Using the Triangle Inequality, we see that the third side must be smaller than the sum of the first two sides, or 13 cm. That means the greatest integer number of centimeters for the third side is $\\boxed{12}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two triangles are similar. The ratio of their areas is 1:4. If the height of the smaller triangle is 3 cm, how long is the corresponding height of the larger triangle, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If any linear dimension (such as radius, side length, height, etc.) of a closed, two-dimensional figure is multiplied by $k$ while the shape of the figure remains the same, the area of the figure is multiplied by $k^2$.  Since the area is multiplied by 4 in going from the smaller triangle to the larger triangle, we have $k^2=4$ which implies $k=2$.  Therefore, each linear dimension is multiplied by 2, so the height of the larger triangle is $(3\\text{ cm})\\times2=\\boxed{6}$ centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles triangle has side lengths 8 cm, 8 cm and 10 cm.  The longest side of a similar triangle is 25 cm. What is the perimeter of the larger triangle, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the length of the longest sides of the small triangle to the large triangle is $10/25 = 2/5$, which must hold constant for all sides of the two triangles since they are similar.  Thus the perimeters of the two triangles are also in the ratio of $2/5$.  The small triangle has perimeter $8+8+10=26$, so the large triangle has perimeter $\\frac{5}{2}\\cdot 26 = \\boxed{65}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If a triangle has two sides of lengths 5 and 7 units, then how many different integer lengths can the third side be?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $n$ be the length of the third side.  Then by the triangle inequality, \\begin{align*}\nn + 5 &> 7, \\\\\nn + 7 &> 5, \\\\\n5 + 7 &> n,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $n > 2$, $n > -2$, and $n < 12$.  Hence, the possible values of $n$ are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, for a total of $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The sum of the lengths of all the edges of a cube is 60 cm. Find the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cube.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since there are 12 congruent edges on a cube, each edge has length $60/12=5$ cm. Since the volume of the cube is equal to the edge length cubed, the volume is $5^3=5\\cdot5\\cdot5=\\boxed{125}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of the sides of a triangle are 6 cm, 7 cm and 9 cm.  In a similar triangle whose perimeter is 110 cm, what is the length of the longest side, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the ratio of side lengths between the similar triangle and the given triangle be $x$, so the lengths of the similar triangle are $6x$, $7x$, and $9x$.  We are given that $6x+7x+9x=110$; solving yields $x=\\frac{110}{(6+7+9)} = \\frac{110}{22}=5$.  The length of the longest side is thus $9x = 9 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{45}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $C$ has radius 6 cm. How many square centimeters are in the area of the largest possible inscribed triangle having one side as a diameter of circle $C$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We may consider the diameter of circle $C$ as the base of the inscribed triangle; its length is $12\\text{ cm}$. Then the corresponding height extends from some point on the diameter to some point on the circle $C$. The greatest possible height is a radius of $C$, achieved when the triangle is right isosceles: [asy]\nunitsize(8);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),6));\ndraw(((-6,0)--(6,0)));\nlabel(\"$12$\",(0,0),S);\ndraw(((-6,-0.6)--(-0.6,-0.6)),BeginArrow);\ndraw(((0.6,-0.6)--(6,-0.6)),EndArrow);\ndraw(((-6,0)--(0,6)));\ndraw(((0,6)--(6,0)));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,6)),dashed);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(0,2.5),E);\n[/asy] In this case, the height is $6\\text{ cm}$, so the area of the triangle is $$\\frac 12\\cdot 12\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{36}\\text{ square centimeters}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The congruent sides of an isosceles triangle are each 5 cm long, and the perimeter is 17 cm. In centimeters, what is the length of the base?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If the length of the base is $b$ centimeters, then the perimeter of the triangle is $5+5+b$ cm.  Solving $5+5+b=17$ we find $b=\\boxed{7}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two sides of scalene $\\bigtriangleup ABC$ measure $3$ centimeters and $5$ centimeters. How many different whole centimeter lengths are possible for the third side?\n\nAnswer:\n",
