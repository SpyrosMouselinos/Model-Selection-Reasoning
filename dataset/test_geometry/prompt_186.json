    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $A$ has coordinates $(x,6)$. When Point $A$ is reflected over the $y$-axis it lands on Point $B$. What is the sum of the four coordinate values of points $A$ and $B$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The coordinates of point $B$ are $(-x,6)$.  The sum of all four coordinates is $x+6+(-x)+6=\\boxed{12}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The image of the point with coordinates $(-3,-1)$ under the reflection across the line $y=mx+b$ is the point with coordinates $(5,3)$.  Find $m+b$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection.  The slope of the segment is $\\frac{3-(-1)}{5-(-3)}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Since the line of reflection is perpendicular, its slope, $m$, equals $-2$.  By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment is $\\left(\\frac{5-3}2,\\frac{3-1}2\\right)=(1,1)$.   Since the line of reflection goes through this point, we have $1=(-2)(1)+b$, and so $b=3$.  Thus $m+b=\\boxed{1}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The image of the point with coordinates $(1,1)$ under the reflection across the line $y=mx+b$ is the point with coordinates $(9,5)$.  Find $m+b$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection.  The slope of the segment is $\\frac{5-1}{9-1}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Since the line of reflection is perpendicular, its slope, $m$, equals $-2$.  By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment are $\\left(\\frac{9+1}2,\\frac{5+1}2\\right)=(5,3)$.   Since the line of reflection goes through this point, we have $3=(-2)(5)+b$, and so $b=13$.  Thus $m+b=-2+13=\\boxed{11}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $\\triangle JKL$ shown, $\\tan K = \\frac{3}{2}$. What is $KL$?\n\n[asy]\npair J,K,L;\nL = (0,0);\nJ = (0,3);\nK = (2,3);\ndraw(L--J--K--L);\ndraw(rightanglemark(L,J,K,7));\nlabel(\"$L$\",L,SW);\nlabel(\"$J$\",J,NW);\nlabel(\"$K$\",K,NE);\nlabel(\"$2$\",(J+K)/2,N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because $\\triangle JKL$ is a right triangle, $\\tan K = \\frac{JL}{JK}$. So $\\tan K = \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{JL}{2}$. Then $JL = 3$.\n\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, $KL = \\sqrt{JL^2 + JK^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $P$ and $R$ are located at (2, 1) and (12, 15) respectively. Point $M$ is the midpoint of segment $\\overline{PR}$. Segment $\\overline{PR}$ is reflected over the $x$-axis. What is the sum of the coordinates of the image of point $M$ (the midpoint of the reflected segment)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Point $M$ has coordinates $(7,8)$. Therefore, its image has coordinates $(7,-8)$. Thus the sum is $7-8 = \\boxed{-1}$.\n\nAlternatively, the image of point $M$ is the midpoint of the images of points $P$ and $R$ and thus is the midpoint of $(2,-1)$ and $(12,-15)$, which is also $(7,-8)$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $JKL$, angle $J$ measures 60 degrees and angle $K$ measures 30 degrees. When drawn, the angle bisectors of angles $J$ and $K$ intersect at a point $M$. What is the measure of obtuse angle $JMK$?\n\n[asy]\nimport geometry;\nimport olympiad;\nunitsize(0.8inch);\ndotfactor = 3;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(1pt)+fontsize(10pt));\n\npair J,K,L,M,U,V;\n\nJ = (0,0);\nK = (1,2);\nL = (1,0);\n\ndraw(J--K--L--cycle);\ndraw(rightanglemark(J,L,K,5));\n\nlabel(\"$J$\",J,W);\nlabel(\"$K$\",K,N);\nlabel(\"$L$\",L,E);\n\nU = (1,2/3);\nV = (2/(2+sqrt(3)),0);\n\ndraw(J--U);\ndraw(K--V);\n\nM = intersectionpoint(J--U,K--V);\ndot(\"M\",M,NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $JM$ bisects $\\angle J$, we know that the measure of $\\angle KJM$ is $60/2 = 30$ degrees. Similarly, since $MK$ bisects $\\angle K$, we know that the measure of $\\angle JKM$ is $30/2 = 15$ degrees. Finally, since the sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle always equals $180$ degrees, we know that the sum of the measures of $\\angle JKM$, $\\angle KJM$, and $\\angle JMK$ equals $180$ degrees. Thus, the measure of $\\angle JMK = 180 - 30 - 15 = \\boxed{135}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ with vertices of $A(6,2)$, $B(2,5)$, and $C(2,2)$ is reflected over the x-axis to triangle $A'B'C'$. This triangle is reflected over the y-axis to triangle $A''B''C''$. What are the coordinates of point $C''$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A reflection over the $x$-axis negates the $y$-coordinate, while a reflection over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coordinate. So reflecting $C$ over the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis means we negate both coordinates to get $\\boxed{(-2, -2)}$ as the coordinates of point $C''$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $B$ has its center at $(-6, 2)$ and a radius of $10$ units. What is the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the two points on circle $B$ that are also on the $y$-axis?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that if the $y$-coordinate of one of the two points is $2+c$, then the $y$-coordinate of the other point must be $2-c$ because the two points must be equidistant from the line $y=2$. Therefore, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the two points on circle $B$ that are also on the $y$-axis is $\\boxed{4}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the figure, $m\\angle A = 28^{\\circ}$, $m\\angle B = 74^\\circ$ and $m\\angle C = 26^{\\circ}$. If $x$ and $y$ are the measures of the angles in which they are shown, what is the value of $x + y$?

By vertical angles, this makes the rightmost angle in the triangle containing angle $y$ also equal to 64 degrees.  Thus, the third angle in that triangle has measure $180-(y+64)=116-y$ degrees.  Now, we can turn our attention to the five sided figure that contains angles $A$, $B$, and $x$.  By vertical angles the right most angle will be $116-y$ degrees.  The angle with exterior measure of $x$ degrees will have an interior measure of $360-x$ degrees.  Finally, the sum of the angles in a five sided polygon will be equal to $(5-2)180=540$ degrees.  So, we can write $$A+B+360-x+90+116-y=540$$ $$28+74+360-x+90+116-y=540$$ $$\\boxed{128}=x+y$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The point at $(a, b)$ on a Cartesian plane is reflected over the  $y$-axis to the point at $(j, k)$. If $a + j = 0$ and $b + k = 0$, what is the value of $b$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
