    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When the height of a cylinder is doubled and its radius is increased by $200\\%$, the cylinder's volume is multiplied by a factor of $X$. What is the value of $X$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylinder's original volume is $\\pi r^2h$. The new height is $2h$ and the new radius is $r+\\frac{200}{100}r=3r$. That means the new volume is $\\pi (3r)^2(2h)=\\pi r^2h(9)(2)$. The new volume is the original volume multiplied by a factor of $\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Either increasing the radius or the height of a cylinder by six inches will result in the same volume. The original height of the cylinder is two inches. What is the original radius in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the original radius be $r$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased radius is $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased height is $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Since we are told these two volumes are the same, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2 = \\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Simplifying, we have $(r+6)^2=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2+12r+36=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2-4r-12=0$. Factoring, we have $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=\\boxed{6}$ (it cannot be negative because it is a physical length).\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cylinders each have radius 8 inches and height 3 inches. The radius of one cylinder and the height of the other are both increased by the same nonzero number of inches. The resulting volumes are equal. How many inches is the increase? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the increase measure $x$ inches.  The cylinder with increased radius now has volume  \\[\\pi (8+x)^2 (3)\\] and the cylinder with increased height now has volume \\[\\pi (8^2) (3+x).\\] Setting these two quantities equal and solving yields  \\[3(64+16x+x^2)=64(3+x) \\Rightarrow 3x^2-16x=x(3x-16)=0\\] so $x=0$ or $x=16/3$.  The latter is the valid solution, so the increase measures $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cylinder with radius 2 is inscribed in a hemisphere with radius 5 so that its bases are parallel to the base of the hemisphere.  What is the height of this cylinder?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We draw and label a diagram as follows: [asy]\n\nsize(110);\npair O = (0,0); pair A = (.3,.94); pair B = (.3,.075);\ndraw(O--A--B--cycle,heavycyan);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W); label(\"$A$\",A,N); label(\"$B$\",B,S);\nimport solids; import three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); currentprojection = orthographic(5,0,1.3);\nrevolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), .4, .91);\ndraw(c,black);\n\ndraw(scale(1,.25)*arc((0,0),1,0,180),dashed);\ndraw(scale(1,.25)*arc((0,0),1,180,360));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,180));\n\n[/asy]\n\nLet the center of the hemisphere be $O$, and let $A$ be a point on the circumference of the top circle of the cylinder.  Since the cylinder is inscribed in the hemisphere, $A$ lies on the hemisphere as well, so $OA=5$.  We drop a perpendicular from $A$ to the base of the hemisphere and let it intersect the base of the hemisphere at $B$.  Since the cylinder is right and $AB$ is a height of the cylinder, $\\angle OBA$ is a right angle, and $B$ lies on the circumference of the bottom circle of the cylinder.  Thus, $OB$ is a radius of the cylinder, so $OB=2$. We have that $\\triangle OBA$ is right, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\[AB=\\sqrt{OA^2-OB^2}=\\sqrt{5^2-2^2}=\\sqrt{21}.\\]Thus, the height of the cylinder is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{21}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle ABC$ be a right triangle such that $B$ is a right angle. A circle with diameter of $BC$ meets side $AC$ at $D.$ If the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $150$ and $AC = 25,$ then what is $BD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We might try sketching a diagram: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO, pD;\npA = (-15, 0);\npB = (0, 0);\npC = (0, 20);\npO = (0, 10);\npD = (-9.6, 7.2);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pD--pB);\ndraw(circle(pO, 10));\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, S);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", pD, W);\n[/asy] Since $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, that makes $\\angle BDC$ a right angle. That means that $BD$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC.$ Then, we use the area formula to find $150 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC \\cdot BD,$ where $AC = 25.$ Solving, we have $BD = \\boxed{12}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cylinder with its diameter equal to its height is inscribed in a right circular cone. The cone has diameter 10 and altitude 12, and the axes of the cylinder and cone coincide. Find the radius of the cylinder. Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cylinder have radius $r$ and height $2r$. Since $\\triangle APQ$ is similar to $\\triangle AOB$, we have $$\\frac{12-2r}{r} = \\frac{12}{5}, \\text{ so } r = \\boxed{\\frac{30}{11}}.$$[asy]\ndraw((0,2)..(-6,0)--(6,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,-2)..(-6,0)--(6,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,1)..(-3,0)--(3,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,-1)..(-3,0)--(3,0)..cycle);\nfill((-6,0.01)--(-6,-0.01)--(6,-0.01)--(6,0.01)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,14)--(0,0)--(6,0),dashed);\ndraw((0,8)..(-3,7)--(3,7)..cycle);\ndraw((0,6)..(-3,7)--(3,7)..cycle);\nfill((-3,7.01)--(-3,6.99)--(3,6.99)--(3,7.01)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,7)--(3,7),dashed);\ndraw((-6,0)--(0,14)--(6,0));\ndraw((-3,0)--(-3,7));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,7));\nlabel(\"{\\tiny O}\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny B}\",(6,0),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny P}\",(0,7),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny Q}\",(3,7),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny A}\",(0,14),E);\ndraw((0,-2.5)--(6,-2.5),Arrows);\ndraw((-6.5,0)--(-6.5,14),Arrows);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 5}\",(3,-2.5),S);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12}\",(-6.5,7),W);\ndraw((10,0)--(15,0)--(10,12)--cycle);\ndraw((10,6)--(12.5,6));\ndraw((15.5,0)--(15.5,12),Arrows);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny O}\",(10,0),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny P}\",(10,6),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny A}\",(10,12),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 2r}\",(10,3),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12-2r}\",(10,9),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny B}\",(15,0),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny Q}\",(12.5,6),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12}\",(15.5,6),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 5}\",(12.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Increasing the radius of a cylinder by $6$ units increased the volume by $y$ cubic units. Increasing the height of the cylinder by $6$ units also increases the volume by $y$ cubic units. If the original height is $2$, then the original radius is:\n$\\text{(A) } 2 \\qquad \\text{(B) } 4 \\qquad \\text{(C) } 6 \\qquad \\text{(D) } 6\\pi \\qquad \\text{(E) } 8$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that the volume of a cylinder is equal to $\\pi r^2h$, where $r$ and $h$ are the radius and height, respectively. So we know that $2\\pi (r+6)^2-2\\pi r^2=y=\\pi r^2(2+6)-2\\pi r^2$. Expanding and rearranging, we get that $2\\pi (12r+36)=6\\pi r^2$. Divide both sides by $6\\pi$ to get that $4r+12=r^2$, and rearrange to see that $r^2-4r-12=0$. This factors to become $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=6$ or $r=-2$. Obviously, the radius cannot be negative, so our answer is $\\boxed{6}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A solid box is 15 cm by 10 cm by 8 cm. A new solid is formed by removing a cube 3 cm on a side from each corner of this box. What percent of the original volume is removed?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The total volume of the eight removed cubes is $8\\times 3^{3}=216$ cubic centimeters, and the volume of the original box is $15\\times 10\\times 8 = 1200$ cubic centimeters. Therefore the volume has been reduced by $\\left(\\frac{216}{1200}\\right)(100\\%) = \\boxed{18\\%}. $\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylinder with a height of 5 inches has a radius of 2 inches. What is the area of the curved surface of the cylinder, in square inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The lateral area of a cylinder is $2\\pi rh$. Since $h = 5$ and $r = 2$, our answer is $2\\pi\\cdot 2\\cdot 5 = \\boxed{20\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The radius of a right circular cylinder is decreased by $20\\%$ and its height is increased by $25\\%$. What is the absolute value of the percent change in the volume of the cylinder?\n\nAnswer:\n",
