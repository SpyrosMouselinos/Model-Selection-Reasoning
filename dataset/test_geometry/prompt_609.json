    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle is made of wood sticks of lengths 8, 15 and 17 inches joined end-to-end. Pieces of the same integral length are cut from each of the sticks so that the three remaining pieces can no longer form a triangle. How many inches are in the length of the smallest piece that can be cut from each of the three sticks to make this happen?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Our current triangle lengths are 8, 15, and 17. Let us say that $x$ is the length of the piece that we cut from each of the three sticks. Then, our lengths will be $8 - x,$ $15 - x,$ and $17 - x.$ These lengths will no longer form a triangle when the two shorter lengths added together is shorter than or equal to the longest length. In other words, $(8 - x) + (15 - x) \\leq (17 - x).$ Then, we have $23 - 2x \\leq 17 - x,$ so $6 \\leq x.$ Therefore, the length of the smallest piece that can be cut from each of the three sticks is $\\boxed{6}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A stick 5 cm long, a stick 9 cm long, and a third stick $n$ cm long form a triangle. What is the sum of all possible whole number values of $n$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Using the Triangle Inequality, we see that $n > 4$ and $n < 14,$ so $n$ can be any integer from $5$ to $13,$ inclusive. The sum can be calculated in several ways, but regardless, $5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 = \\boxed{81}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many different triangles can be formed having a perimeter of 7 units if each side must have integral length?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $a,b,$ and $c$ represent the three side lengths of the triangle. The perimeter is $a+b+c=7,$ so $b+c=7-a$. We know by the Triangle Inequality that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle must be greater than the third side length. If we focus on the variable $a$, we have\n\\[b+c>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 7-a>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 3.5>a.\\]We could easily replace $a$ with $b$ or $c$, so the maximum length of any of the three sides is $3$. If $a=3$, then $b+c=4$ and $b$ and $c$ could be $1$ and $3$ in some order or $2$ and $2$ in some order. If we let $a=2$ or $a=1$ and the maximum side length is $3$, we'll still end up with triangles of side lengths $(1,3,3)$ or $(2,2,3)$. There are $\\boxed{2}$ different triangles.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many different isosceles triangles have integer side lengths and perimeter 23?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because the perimeter of such a triangle is 23, and the sum of the two equal side lengths is even, the length of the base is odd. Also, the length of the base is less than the sum of the other two side lengths, so it is less than half of 23. Thus the $\\boxed{6}$ possible triangles have side lengths 1, 11, 11; 3, 10, 10; 5, 9, 9; 7, 8, 8; 9, 7, 7 and 11, 6, 6.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many non-congruent triangles with only integer side lengths have a perimeter of 15 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In a triangle, the lengths of any two sides must add up to a value larger than the third length's side.  This is known as the Triangle Inequality.  Keeping this in mind, we list out cases based on the length of the shortest side.\n\nCase 1:  shortest side has length $1$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $7$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{1,7,7\\}$.\n\nCase 2:  shortest side has length $2$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $6$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{2,6,7\\}$.\n\nCase 3:  shortest side has length $3$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $6$ and $6$ or $5$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{3,6,6\\}$ and $\\{3,5,7\\}$.\n\nCase 4:  shortest side has length $4$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $5$ and $6$ or $4$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{4,5,6\\}$ and $\\{4,4,7\\}$.\n\nCase 5:  shortest side has length $5$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $5$ and $5$.  This leads to the set $\\{5,5,5\\}$.\n\nHence there are $\\boxed{7}$ sets of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of $15$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If a triangle has two sides of lengths 5 and 7 units, then how many different integer lengths can the third side be?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $n$ be the length of the third side.  Then by the triangle inequality, \\begin{align*}\nn + 5 &> 7, \\\\\nn + 7 &> 5, \\\\\n5 + 7 &> n,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $n > 2$, $n > -2$, and $n < 12$.  Hence, the possible values of $n$ are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, for a total of $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The graphs of the equations\n$y=k, \\qquad y=\\sqrt{3}x+2k, \\qquad y=-\\sqrt{3}x+2k,$\nare drawn in the coordinate plane for $k=-10,-9,-8,\\ldots,9,10.\\,$ These 63 lines cut part of the plane into equilateral triangles of side $2/\\sqrt{3}.\\,$ How many such triangles are formed?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We note that the lines partition the hexagon of the six extremal lines into disjoint unit regular triangles, and forms a series of unit regular triangles along the edge of the hexagon.\n[asy] size(200); picture pica, picb, picc; int i; for(i=-10;i<=10;++i){ if((i%10) == 0){draw(pica,(-20/sqrt(3)-abs((0,i))/sqrt(3),i)--(20/sqrt(3)+abs((0,i))/sqrt(3),i),black+0.7);} else{draw(pica,(-20/sqrt(3)-abs((0,i))/sqrt(3),i)--(20/sqrt(3)+abs((0,i))/sqrt(3),i));} } picb = rotate(120,origin)*pica; picc = rotate(240,origin)*pica; add(pica);add(picb);add(picc); [/asy]\nSolving the above equations for $k=\\pm 10$, we see that the hexagon in question is regular, with side length $\\frac{20}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Then, the number of triangles within the hexagon is simply the ratio of the area of the hexagon to the area of a regular triangle. Since the ratio of the area of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their side lengths, we see that the ratio of the area of one of the six equilateral triangles composing the regular hexagon to the area of a unit regular triangle is just $\\left(\\frac{20/\\sqrt{3}}{2/\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = 100$. Thus, the total number of unit triangles is $6 \\times 100 = 600$.\nThere are $6 \\cdot 10$ equilateral triangles formed by lines on the edges of the hexagon. Thus, our answer is $600+60 = \\boxed{660}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Steve has an isosceles triangle with base 8 inches and height 10 inches. He wants to cut it into eight pieces that have equal areas, as shown below. To the nearest hundredth of an inch what is the number of inches in the greatest perimeter among the eight pieces? [asy]\nsize(150);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(8,0));\nfor(int i = 0; i < 9; ++i){\ndraw((4,10)--(i,0));\n}\ndraw((0,-0.5)--(8,-0.5),Bars(5));\nlabel(\"$8''$\",(0,-0.5)--(8,-0.5),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To make the $8$ triangles have the same area, the base must be divided into $8$ segments of length $1$ inch each.  Define points $A$, $B_0$, $B_1$, $B_2$, $B_3$, and $B_4$ as in the figure.  For $0\\leq k\\leq 3$, the perimeter $P(k)$ of triangle $A B_k B_{k+1}$ in inches is \\[\nP(k)=1+\\sqrt{10^2+k^2}+\\sqrt{10^2+(k+1)^2},\n\\]where each distance $A B_k$ is calculated by applying the Pythagorean theorem to right triangle $A B_0 B_k$.  Since $P(k)$ increases as $k$ increases, its largest value is $P(3)=1+\\sqrt{100+3^2}+\\sqrt{100+4^2}$, which to the nearest hundredth is $\\boxed{22.21}$ inches.  [asy]\nsize(200);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndraw((0,0)--(8,0));\nfor(int i = 0; i < 9; ++i){\ndraw((4,10)--(i,0));\nif(i>=4)\n\nlabel(\"$B_\"+string(i-4)+\"$\",(i,0),S);\n}\nlabel(\"$A$\",(4,10),N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the minimum number of equilateral triangles, of side length 1 unit, needed to cover an equilateral triangle of side length 10 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the sides of the small to big equilateral triangle (note that they are similar) is $1/10$, so the ratio of their areas is $(1/10)^2 = 1/100$. So the big equilateral triangle has 100 times the area of a small one, so it will take $\\boxed{100}$ small triangles to cover the big one.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Kendra has an unlimited supply of unbreakable sticks of length 2, 4 and 6 inches. Using these sticks, how many non-congruent triangles can she make if each side is made with a whole stick? Two sticks can be joined only at a vertex of the triangle. (A triangle with sides of lengths 4, 6, 6 is an example of one such triangle to be included, whereas a triangle with sides of lengths 2, 2, 4 should not be included.)\n\nAnswer:\n",
