    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A prism has 15 edges. How many faces does the prism have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If a prism has 2 bases and $L$ lateral faces, then each base is an $L$-gon, so the two bases collectively have $2L$ edges.  Also, there are $L$ edges connecting corresponding vertices of the two bases, for a total of $3L$ edges.  Solving $3L=15$, we find that the prism has 5 lateral faces and hence $5+2=\\boxed{7}$ faces in total.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the sum of the number of faces, edges and vertices of a triangular prism?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(10,0)--(5,8.7)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(20,20),dashed);\ndraw((10,0)--(30,20));\ndraw((5,8.7)--(25,28.7));\ndraw((25,28.7)--(30,20)--(20,20)--cycle,dashed);\ndraw((25,28.7)--(30,20));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Faces: There are $3$ on the sides, a top face, and a bottom face, so $5$.\n\nEdges: There are $3$ on the top, $3$ on the bottom, and $3$ connecting them, for $9$.\n\nVertices: There are $3$ on the top and $3$ on the bottom, for $6$.\n\nSo $5+9+6=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The side length of the regular hexagon is 10 cm. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the shaded region? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\n\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\nfill(B--C--E--F--cycle,heavycyan);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label points $A$, $B$, $C$ as shown below, and let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$. [asy]\n\nsize(120);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\nfill(B--C--E--F--cycle,heavycyan); pair H=(E+C)/2; draw(D--H); draw(E--C); label(\"$A$\",C,NW);label(\"$B$\",D,W);label(\"$C$\",E,SW);label(\"$H$\",H,ESE);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy] Since the hexagon is regular, $\\angle ABC = 120^\\circ$ and $\\angle ABH = \\angle CBH = 120^\\circ / 2 = 60^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\triangle ABH$ and $\\triangle CBH$ are congruent $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangles.  These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince $AB=BC=10$, we have $BH = AB/2 = 5$ and $AH = CH = \\sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $BH$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $AC = 2\\cdot 5\\sqrt{3} = 10\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe shaded region is a rectangle with base length $10$ and height length $10\\sqrt{3}$; its area is $10\\cdot 10\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{100\\sqrt{3}}$ square cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the total area, in square units, of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid that has base edges measuring 6 units and lateral edges measuring 5 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The triangular faces are isosceles triangles.  We drop an altitude from the apex to the base, and, since the triangle is isosceles, it will also be a median.  So it forms a right triangle with hypotenuse $5$ and one leg $3$, and thus the other leg, the altitude, is $4$.  The area of the triangle is then $\\frac{4(6)}{2}=12$.  Since there are $4$ triangular faces, the total area is $4(12)=\\boxed{48}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n One of the five faces of the triangular prism shown here will be used as the base of a new pyramid. The numbers of exterior faces, vertices and edges of the resulting shape (the fusion of the prism and pyramid) are added. What is the maximum value of this sum?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(9,12)--(25,0)--cycle);\ndraw((9,12)--(12,14)--(28,2)--(25,0));\ndraw((12,14)--(3,2)--(0,0),dashed);\ndraw((3,2)--(28,2),dashed);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The original prism has 5 faces, 9 edges, and 6 vertices.  If the new pyramid is added to a triangular face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, and 3 new faces.  If instead the new pyramid is added to a quadrilateral face, it will cover one of these faces while adding 1 new vertex, 4 new edges, and 4 new faces.  So, we maximize the sum by adding a pyramid to a quadrilateral face.  This gives us a solid with $5-1+4 = 8$ faces, $9+4=13$ edges, and $6 + 1 = 7$ vertices.  The sum of these is $\\boxed{28}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The figure shows a square in the interior of a regular hexagon.  The square and regular hexagon share a common side. What is the degree measure of $\\angle ABC$? [asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;\nA=(0,.866);\nB=(.5,1.732);\nC=(1.5,1.732);\nD=(2,.866);\nE=(1.5,0);\nF=(.5,0);\nG=(.5,1);\nH=(1.5,1);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--E);\ndraw(E--F);\ndraw(F--A);\ndraw(F--G);\ndraw(G--H);\ndraw(H--E);\ndraw(D--H);\nlabel(\"A\", C, N);\nlabel(\"B\", D, E);\nlabel(\"C\", H, N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label the lower right corner of the square point $D$ and the lower left corner $E$. The interior angles of a regular hexagon are 120 degrees and the interior angles of a square are 90 degrees. Thus, $m\\angle BDC=m \\angle BDE - m\\angle CDE=120^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 30^\\circ$. In addition, because the square and regular hexagon share a side and all of their sides have the same length, segments $CD$ and $BD$ have the same length. Thus, triangle $BCD$ is isosceles.\n\nBecause the base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent, $m\\angle BCD = m \\angle CBD=x$. In addition, because the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have  \\begin{align*}\n180^\\circ &= m\\angle BDC+m\\angle BCD + m\\angle CBD \\\\\n&=30^\\circ + x + x \\\\\n150^\\circ &= 2x \\\\\n75^\\circ = x\n\\end{align*} Thus, $m\\angle CBD=75^\\circ$. Finally, we calculate $m\\angle ABC=m\\angle ABD- m\\angle CBD=120^\\circ-75^\\circ=\\boxed{45}^\\circ$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the number of units in the length of diagonal $DA$ of the regular hexagon shown. Express your answer in simplest radical form. [asy]\nsize(120);\ndraw((1,0)--(3,0)--(4,1.732)--(3,3.464)--(1,3.464)--(0,1.732)--cycle);\ndraw((1,0)--(1,3.464));\nlabel(\"10\",(3.5,2.598),NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(1,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(1,3.464),NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label point $X$ as shown below, and let $Y$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $X$ to $AD$. [asy]\n\nsize(120);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300); label(\"$10$\",(A+B)/2,NE);\npair H=(E+C)/2; draw(D--H); draw(E--C); label(\"$D$\",C,NW);label(\"$X$\",D,W);label(\"$A$\",E,SW);label(\"$Y$\",H,E);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy] Since the hexagon is regular, $\\angle DXA = 120^\\circ$ and $\\angle AXY = \\angle DXY = 120^\\circ / 2 = 60^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\triangle AXY$ and $\\triangle DXY$ are congruent $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangles.  These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince the side length of the hexagon is 10, we have $AX=XD=10$.  It follows that $XY = AX/2 = 5$ and $AY = DY = \\sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $XY$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $DA = 2\\cdot 5\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{10\\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has eight vertices (corners) and twelve edges. A segment, such as $x$, which joins two vertices not joined by an edge is called a diagonal. Segment $y$ is also a diagonal. How many diagonals does a cube have? [asy]\n/* AMC8 1998 #17 Problem */\npair A=(0,48), B=(0,0), C=(48,0), D=(48,48);\npair E=(24,72), F=(24,24), G=(72,24), H=(72,72);\npen d = linetype(\"8 8\");\n\ndraw(A--D--C--B--cycle);\ndraw(D--H--G--C);\ndraw(A--E--H);\n\ndraw(B--F--E);\ndraw(F--G);\ndraw(H--A--G, d);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (40, 61), N);\nlabel(\"$y$\", (40, 35), N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are two diagonals, such as $x$, in each of the six faces for a total of twelve face diagonals. There are also four space diagonals, such as $y$, which are within the cube. This makes a total of $\\boxed{16}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measures of the interior angles of a convex hexagon form an increasing arithmetic sequence. How many such sequences are possible if the hexagon is not equiangular and all of the angle degree measures are positive integers less than $150$ degrees?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The number of degrees in a hexagon is $(6-2) \\cdot 180=720$ degrees. Setting the degree of the smallest angle to be $x$, and the increment to be $d$, we get that the sum of all of the degrees is $x+x+d+x+2d+x+3d+x+4d+x+5d=6x+15d=720$. We want $15d$ to be even so that adding it to an even number $6x$ would produce an even number $720$. Therefore, $d$ must be even. The largest angle we can have must be less than $150$, so we try even values for $d$ until we get an angle that's greater or equal to $150$.  Similarly, we can conclude that $x$ must be a multiple of 5.\n\nThe largest angle is $x + 5d.$  We notice that, if we divide both sides of $6x + 15d = 720$ by 3, we get $2x + 5d = 240.$  For $x + 5d < 150,$ we must have $x > 90.$  The largest value of $d$ occurs when $x = 95$ and $5d = 240 - 2x = 240 - 2 \\cdot 95 = 240 - 190 = 50,$ or $d = 10.$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ values for $d$: $2,4,6,8,$ and $10$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of square units in the area of the hexagon below?\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor = 4;\nint i,j;\nfor(i=0;i<=4;++i)\n\n{\n\nfor(j=-3;j<=3;++j)\n\n{\n\ndot((i,j));\n\n}\n\n}\n\nfor(i=1;i<=4;++i)\n\n{\n\ndraw((i,-1/3)--(i,1/3));\n\n}\nfor(j=1;j<=3;++j)\n\n{\n\ndraw((-1/3,j)--(1/3,j));\n\ndraw((-1/3,-j)--(1/3,-j));\n\n}\n\nreal eps = 0.2;\n\ndraw((3,3.5+eps)--(3,3.5-eps));\ndraw((4,3.5+eps)--(4,3.5-eps));\ndraw((3,3.5)--(4,3.5));\n\nlabel(\"1 unit\",(3.5,4));\n\ndraw((4.5-eps,2)--(4.5+eps,2));\ndraw((4.5-eps,3)--(4.5+eps,3));\ndraw((4.5,2)--(4.5,3));\n\nlabel(\"1 unit\",(5.2,2.5));\n\ndraw((-1,0)--(5,0));\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,4));\ndraw((0,0)--(1,3)--(3,3)--(4,0)--(3,-3)--(1,-3)--cycle,linewidth(2));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each of the four shaded triangles in the diagram below has area $\\frac{1}{2}(1)(3)=\\frac{3}{2}$ square units, and the shaded triangles along with the hexagon form a rectangular region whose area is $6\\cdot4=24$ square units.
