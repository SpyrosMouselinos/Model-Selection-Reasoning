Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The diagonals of a regular hexagon have two possible lengths. What is the ratio of the shorter length to the longer length? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two possible diagonal lengths are $AB$ and $AC$.  The measure of an interior angle of a regular hexagon is $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees. Therefore, angle $BCA$ measures $120/2=60$ degrees.  Also, the base angles of the isosceles triangle with the marked 120-degree angle each measure $(180-120)/2=30$ degrees. This implies that $\\angle CBA$ is a right angle, so triangle $ABC$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.  Therefore, the ratio of $AB$ to $AC$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.

Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular hexagon is inscribed in a circle and another regular hexagon is circumscribed about the same circle. What is the ratio of the area of the larger hexagon to the area of the smaller hexagon? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Form a triangle whose first vertex is the center of the circle and whose other two vertices are the midpoint and one of the endpoints of a side of the larger hexagon, as shown in the diagram.  Since each interior angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees, this triangle is a 30-60-90 right triangle.  Let $r$ be the radius of the circle.  The length of the longer leg of the triangle is $r$, so the length of the shorter leg is $r/\\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the hypotenuse is $2r/\\sqrt{3}$.  Since for the smaller hexagon the length of the segment connecting a vertex to the center is $r$, the dimensions of the larger hexagon are $2/\\sqrt{3}$ times larger than the dimensions of the smaller hexagon.  Therefore, the area of the larger triangle is $(2/\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$ times greater than the area of the smaller triangle.\n\n[asy]\nsize(5cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));\nfor(i=0;i<=5;++i)\n\n{\n\ndraw(dir(60*i)--dir(60*(i+1)));\n\ndraw(2/sqrt(3)*dir(60*i)--2/sqrt(3)*dir(60*(i+1)));\n\n}\ndraw(2/sqrt(3)*dir(0)--(0,0)--dir(30));\ndraw(0.93*dir(30)--dir(30)+0.07*dir(-60)+0.07*dir(210)--dir(30)+0.07*dir(-60));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A wire is cut into two pieces, one of length $a$ and the other of length $b$. The piece of length $a$ is bent to form an equilateral triangle, and the piece of length $b$ is bent to form a regular hexagon. The triangle and the hexagon have equal area. What is $\\frac{a}{b}$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The side length of the triangle and hexagon are $\\frac{a}{3}$ and $\\frac{b}{6},$ respectively, so their areas are \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\left(\\frac{a}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a^2 \\sqrt3}{36} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{3\\sqrt3}{2} \\left(\\frac{b}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{b^2\\sqrt3}{24},\\]respectively.

In square units, what is the area of the hexagon? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect opposite pairs of vertices of the regular hexagon with line segments as shown.  Since each angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees, the six triangles produced are equilateral.  The diameter of the circle circumscribed around the hexagon is equal to twice the side length of each of the triangles.  Therefore, each triangle has side length 2 units.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ units is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$ square units.  (To show this, divide the equilateral triangle into two smaller 30-60-90 triangles.)  Substituting $s=2$, we find that the area of each triangle is $\\sqrt{3}$ square units.  Therefore, area of the hexagon is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(3.5cm);\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\n\nfor(i=0;i<=5;i=i+1)\n\n{\n\ndot((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\ndraw((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6))--(cos(2*pi*(i+1)/6),sin(2*pi*(i+1)/6)));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\n}\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the number of units in the length of diagonal $DA$ of the regular hexagon shown.

These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince the side length of the hexagon is 10, we have $AX=XD=10$.

These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince $AB=BC=10$, we have $BH = AB/2 = 5$ and $AH = CH = \\sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.
