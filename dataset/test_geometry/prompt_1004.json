    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The six edges of a tetrahedron $ABCD$ measure $7, 13, 18, 27, 36$ and $41$ units. If the length of edge $AB$ is $41$, then the length of edge $CD$ is\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 7\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 13\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 18\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 27\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 36$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the triangle inequality in $\\triangle ABC$, we find that $BC$ and $CA$ must sum to greater than $41$, so they must be (in some order) $7$ and $36$, $13$ and $36$, $18$ and $27$, $18$ and $36$, or $27$ and $36$. We try $7$ and $36$, and now by the triangle inequality in $\\triangle ABD$, we must use the remaining numbers $13$, $18$, and $27$ to get a sum greater than $41$, so the only possibility is $18$ and $27$. This works as we can put $BC = 36$, $AC = 7$, $AD = 18$, $BD = 27$, $CD = 13$, so that $\\triangle ADC$ and $\\triangle BDC$ also satisfy the triangle inequality. Hence we have found a solution that works, and it can be verified that the other possibilities don't work, though as this is a multiple-choice competition, you probably wouldn't do that in order to save time. In any case, the answer is $CD = \\boxed{13}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In tetrahedron $ABCD$, edge $AB$ has length 3 cm. The area of face $ABC$ is $15\\mbox{cm}^2$ and the area of face $ABD$ is $12 \\mbox { cm}^2$. These two faces meet each other at a $30^\\circ$ angle. Find the volume of the tetrahedron in $\\mbox{cm}^3$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n It is clear that $DX=8$ and $CX=10$ where $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ and $C$ to side $AB$. Thus $[DXC]=\\frac{ab\\sin{c}}{2}=20=5 \\cdot h \\rightarrow h = 4$ where h is the height of the tetrahedron from $D$. Hence, the volume of the tetrahedron is $\\frac{bh}{3}=15\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of one lateral face of a right pyramid with an equilateral triangular base is 75 square meters. If the slant height is 30 meters, what is the length of the side of its base, in meters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $s$ represent the sidelength of the equilateral triangular base. Each face of the pyramid has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}bh=75$, where $b$ is the sidelength of the base and $h$ is the slant height of 30 meters. We have  $$75=\\frac{1}{2}s(30)=15s.$$So, $s=5$ and the sidelength of the base is $\\boxed{5}$ meters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base with perimeter 24 inches. Its apex is 9 inches from each of the other vertices. What is the height of the pyramid from its peak to the center of its square base, in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\ndraw(P--C);\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\ndraw(P--F--B,dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base.  Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFB$ is a right triangle.  The perimeter of the base of the pyramid is 24 inches, so the length of each side of the base is $6$ inches.  Since $F$ is the center of the base, $FB$ is half the diagonal of the base, or $(6\\sqrt{2})/2 = 3\\sqrt{2}$ inches.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $PFB$ gives  \\[PF = \\sqrt{PB^2 - FB^2} = \\sqrt{81 - 18} = \\sqrt{63} = \\boxed{3\\sqrt{7}} \\text{ inches}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Faces $ABC$ and $BCD$ of tetrahedron $ABCD$ meet at an angle of $30^\\circ$. The area of face $ABC$ is $120$, the area of face $BCD$ is $80$, and $BC=10$. Find the volume of the tetrahedron.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the area $BCD=80=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10\\cdot16$, the perpendicular from $D$ to $BC$ has length $16$.\nThe perpendicular from $D$ to $ABC$ is $16 \\cdot \\sin 30^\\circ=8$. Therefore, the volume is $\\frac{8\\cdot120}{3}=\\boxed{320}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a regular tetrahedron the centers of the four faces are the vertices of a smaller tetrahedron. The ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to that of the larger is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Embed the tetrahedron in 4-space to make calculations easier. Its vertices are $(1,0,0,0)$, $(0,1,0,0)$, $(0,0,1,0)$, $(0,0,0,1)$.\nTo get the center of any face, we take the average of the three coordinates of that face. The vertices of the center of the faces are: $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, 0)$,$(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3},0, \\frac{1}{3})$,$(\\frac{1}{3},0, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$,$(0,\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\nThe side length of the large tetrahedron is $\\sqrt{2}$ by the distance formula. The side length of the smaller tetrahedron is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$ by the distance formula.\nTheir ratio is $1:3$, so the ratio of their volumes is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}$.\n$m+n = 1 + 27 = \\boxed{28}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle PQR$ be a triangle in the plane, and let $S$ be a point outside the plane of $\\triangle PQR$, so that $SPQR$ is a pyramid whose faces are all triangles.\n\nSuppose that every edge of $SPQR$ has length $18$ or $41$, but no face of $SPQR$ is equilateral. Then what is the surface area of $SPQR$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since all edges of pyramid $SPQR$ have length $18$ or $41$, each triangular face must be isosceles: either $18$-$18$-$41$ or $18$-$41$-$41$. But the first of these two sets of side lengths violates the triangle inequality, since $18+18<41$. Therefore, every face of $SPQR$ must have sides of lengths $18,$ $41,$ and $41$.\n\nTo find the area of each face, we draw an $18$-$41$-$41$ triangle with altitude $h$: [asy]\nsize(4cm);\npair a=(0,40); pair b=(-9,0); pair c=(9,0); pair o=(0,0);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); draw(a--b--c--a); draw(a--o,dashed); draw(rightanglemark(a,o,c,60));\nlabel(\"$h$\",(a+2*o)/3,SE);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+c)/2,E);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+c)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+b)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+b)/2,N);\n[/asy] Since the triangle is isosceles, we know the altitude bisects the base (as marked above). By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $9^2+h^2=41^2$ and thus $h=40$. So, the triangle has area $\\frac 12\\cdot 18\\cdot 40 = 360$.\n\nThe surface area of pyramid $SPQR$ is made up of four such triangles, so it amounts to $4\\cdot 360 = \\boxed{1440}$.\n\n${\\bf Remark.}$  One might wonder whether a pyramid with the properties enumerated in the problem actually exists. The answer is yes! To form such a pyramid, imagine attaching two $18$-$41$-$41$ triangles (like that in the diagram) along their short edges, so that the triangles are free to rotate around that hinge: [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple a=(9,0,0); triple b=-a; triple c=(0,sqrt(1519),-9); triple d=(0,sqrt(1519),9);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); dot(d);\ndraw(surface(a--b--c--cycle),orange,nolight);\ndraw(b--c--a);\ndraw(surface(a--b--d--cycle),yellow,nolight);\ndraw(b--d--a--b);\ndraw(c--d,dashed);\n[/asy] Now you can adjust the distance between the two \"free\" vertices (the dotted line in the diagram above) so that it is $18$. Adding that edge to the diagram and filling in, we have a pyramid with the desired properties.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid is formed on a $6\\times 8$ rectangular base. The four edges joining the apex to the corners of the rectangular base each have length $13$. What is the volume of the pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know the rectangular base of the pyramid has area $48$. To find the volume, we must also determine the height.\n\nLet the rectangular base be $ABCD$. Let the apex of the pyramid be $X$, and let $O$ be the foot of the perpendicular drawn from $X$ to face $ABCD$: [asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport three;\ntriple A = (-3,-4,0);\ntriple B = (-3,4,0);\ntriple C = (3,4,0);\ntriple D = (3,-4,0);\ntriple O = (0,0,0);\ntriple X = (0,0,12);\ndraw(B--C--D--A--B--X--D);\ndraw(X--C); draw(A--X--O--D,dashed);\ndot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(O); dot(X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,W);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,ESE);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,N);\ndraw(O+(X-O)/19.2--O+(X-O)/19.2+(D-O)/8--O+(D-O)/8);\n[/asy] Then by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\begin{align*}\n13^2 &= OX^2+OA^2 = OX^2+OB^2 \\\\\n&= OX^2+OC^2 = OX^2+OD^2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $OA=OB=OC=OD$, so $O$ must be the center of the rectangle (where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet). This is also the point where the diagonals of $ABCD$ bisect each other. Each diagonal of $ABCD$ has length $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$, so we have $OA=OB=OC=OD=5$.\n\nThus $OX=\\sqrt{13^2-OD^2} = \\sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$, and so the height of the pyramid is $12$. The volume is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac 13\\cdot (\\text{area of base})\\cdot (\\text{height}) &= \\frac 13\\cdot 48\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= 16\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{192}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Euler's formula states that for a convex polyhedron with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces, $V-E+F=2$. A particular convex polyhedron has 32 faces, each of which is either a triangle or a pentagon. At each of its $V$ vertices, $T$ triangular faces and $P$ pentagonal faces meet. What is the value of $100P+10T+V$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The convex polyhedron of the problem can be easily visualized; it corresponds to a dodecahedron (a regular solid with $12$ equilateral pentagons) in which the $20$ vertices have all been truncated to form $20$ equilateral triangles with common vertices. The resulting solid has then $p=12$ smaller equilateral pentagons and $t=20$ equilateral triangles yielding a total of $t+p=F=32$ faces. In each vertex, $T=2$ triangles and $P=2$ pentagons are concurrent. Now, the number of edges $E$ can be obtained if we count the number of sides that each triangle and pentagon contributes: $E=\\frac{3t+5p}{2}$, (the factor $2$ in the denominator is because we are counting twice each edge, since two adjacent faces share one edge). Thus, $E=60$. Finally, using Euler's formula we have $V=E-30=30$.\nIn summary, the solution to the problem is $100P+10T+V=\\boxed{250}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A wooden model of a square pyramid has a base edge of 12 cm and an altitude of 8 cm. A cut is made parallel to the base of the pyramid that separates it into two pieces: a smaller pyramid and a frustum. Each base edge of the smaller pyramid is 6 cm and its altitude is 4 cm. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of the frustum?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid.  The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/2, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$ of the volume of the original pyramid.  Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/8) = {7/8}$ of the original pyramid.\n\nThe original pyramid has base area $12^2 = 144$ square cm, so its volume is $144\\cdot 8/3 = 48\\cdot 8$ cubic centimeters.  Therefore, the frustum has volume \\[\\frac{7}{8}\\cdot (48\\cdot 8) = 48\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{336}\\text{ cubic centimeters}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular tetrahedron is a triangular pyramid in which each face is an equilateral triangle.  If the height of a regular tetrahedron is 20 inches then what is the length of each edge of the tetrahedron? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\nAnswer:\n",
