    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 22, AC=12,$ and $BC=14$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=24$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24\\cdot 2\\cdot 12\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 24\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$24\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 24,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $ABC$ with $\\angle A = 90^\\circ$, we have $AB =16$ and $BC = 24$.  Find $\\sin A$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $\\angle A = 90^\\circ$, we have $\\sin A = \\sin 90^\\circ= \\boxed{1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = AC=7$ and $BC=6$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=10$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{10\\cdot 3\\cdot 3\\cdot 4} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 10,$$ which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{5}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the diameter of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 11,$ $AC=6,$ and $BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $d$ be the diameter of the inscribed circle, and let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=12$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{12\\cdot 1\\cdot 6\\cdot 5} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{6^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 12,$$which yields the radius $r=\\frac {\\sqrt{10}}{2}$. This yields the diameter $d = \\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 5, AC=6, BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=9$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{9\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{3^3\\cdot 2^3} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{6}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{6} = r\\cdot 9,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle ABC$ have side lengths $AB=13$, $AC=14$, and $BC=15$.  There are two circles located inside $\\angle BAC$ which are tangent to rays $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{AC}$, and segment $\\overline{BC}$.  Compute the distance between the centers of these two circles.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two circles described in the problem are shown in the diagram.  The circle located inside $\\triangle ABC$ is called the incircle; following convention we will label its center $I$.  The other circle is known as an excircle, and we label its center $E$.  To begin, we may compute the area of triangle $ABC$ using Heron's formula.  The side lengths of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ are $a=15$, $b=14$, and $c=13$, while the semiperimeter is $s=\\frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)=21$, so its area is \\[ K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{21\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdot 8} = 84. \\]We find the inradius $r$ of $\\triangle ABC$ by using the fact that $K=rs$, so $84=21r$, giving $r=4$.  Next label the points of tangency of the incircle and excircle with ray $\\overline{AC}$ as $S$ and $T$, as shown at right.  It is a standard fact that $AS=s-a=6$ and $AT=s=21$. (The reader should confirm this.  Repeatedly use the fact that tangents from a point to a circle have the same length.)  Furthermore, the angle bisector of $\\angle A$ passes through $I$ and $E$, and the radii $\\overline{SI}$ and $\\overline{TE}$ are perpendicular to $\\overline{AC}$, so triangles $\\triangle ASI$ and $\\triangle ATE$ are similar right triangles.  By the Pythagorean Theorem we compute \\[ AI = \\sqrt{(AS)^2+(SI)^2} = \\sqrt{36+16}=2\\sqrt{13}. \\]Using the similar triangles we find that $AI/AE = AS/AT = 6/21 = 2/7$.  Therefore $AE=7\\sqrt{13}$ and we conclude that $IE=AE-AI=\\boxed{5\\sqrt{13}}$.\n\n[asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\ndraw((0,0)--(4,0)--(3,5)--cycle);\ndraw(incircle((0,0),(4,0),(3,5)));\nreal x = 1.15;\npair A = (0,0) + x*(-3,-5);\npair B = (4,0) + x*(1,-5);\ndraw(A--(3,5)--B--cycle);\ndraw(incircle(A,(3,5),B));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(3,5),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(4,0),E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(0,0),W);\npair I = incenter((0,0),(3,5),(4,0));\npair iFoot = foot(I,(0,0),(3,5));\nlabel(\"$S$\",iFoot,W);\nlabel(\"$I$\",I,E);\ndraw(iFoot--I);\npair I2 = incenter(A,(3,5),B);\npair iFoot2 = foot(I2,(0,0),(3,5));\nlabel(\"$T$\",iFoot2,W);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I2,S);\ndraw(iFoot2--I2);\ndraw((3,5)--(I2));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle with sides of 5, 12, and 13 has both an inscribed and a circumscribed circle.  What is the distance between the centers of those circles?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the triangle so that $AB = 5$, $AC = 12$, and $BC = 13$.  Let $I$ and $O$ be the incenter and circumcenter of triangle $ABC$, respectively.  Let the incircle of triangle $ABC$ be tangent to sides $BC$, $AC$, and $AB$ at $D$, $E$, and $F$, respectively.\n\n[asy]\nimport geometry;\n\nunitsize(0.4 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, I, O;\n\nA = (5^2/13,5*12/13);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (13,0);\nI = incenter(A,B,C);\nD = (I + reflect(B,C)*(I))/2;\nE = (I + reflect(C,A)*(I))/2;\nF = (I + reflect(A,B)*(I))/2;\nO = (B + C)/2;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(incircle(A,B,C));\ndraw(I--D);\ndraw(I--E);\ndraw(I--F);\ndraw(I--O);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\ndot(\"$D$\", D, S);\ndot(\"$E$\", E, NE);\ndot(\"$F$\", F, NW);\ndot(\"$I$\", I, N);\ndot(\"$O$\", O, S);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle BAC = 90^\\circ$, the circumcenter $O$ of triangle $ABC$ is the midpoint of hypotenuse $BC$.\n\nSince $AE$ and $AF$ are tangents from $A$ to the same circle, $AE = AF$.  Let $x = AE = AF$.  Similarly, let $y = BD = BF$ and $z = CD = CE$.  Then $x + y = AF + BF = AB = 5$, $x + z = AE + CE = AC = 12$, $y + z = BD + CD = BC = 13$.  Solving this system of equations, we find $x = 2$, $y = 3$, and $z = 10$.  Then $DO = BO - BD = BC/2 - y = 13/2 - 3 = 7/2$.\n\nThe inradius $r$ of triangle $ABC$ is given by $r = K/s$, where $K$ is the area of triangle $ABC$, and $s$ is the semi-perimeter.  We see that $K = [ABC] = 1/2 \\cdot AB \\cdot AC = 1/2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 12 = 30$, and $s = (AB + AC + BC)/2 = (5 + 12 + 13)/2 = 15$, so $r = 30/15 = 2$.\n\nHence, by the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $IDO$, \\[IO = \\sqrt{ID^2 + DO^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + \\left( \\frac{7}{2} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{65}{4}} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{2}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The point $O$ is the center of the circle circumscribed about $\\triangle ABC$, with $\\angle BOC = 120^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle AOB =\n140^{\\circ}$, as shown.
