    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ with vertices of $A(6,2)$, $B(2,5)$, and $C(2,2)$ is reflected over the x-axis to triangle $A'B'C'$. This triangle is reflected over the y-axis to triangle $A''B''C''$. What are the coordinates of point $C''$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A reflection over the $x$-axis negates the $y$-coordinate, while a reflection over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coordinate. So reflecting $C$ over the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis means we negate both coordinates to get $\\boxed{(-2, -2)}$ as the coordinates of point $C''$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Square ABCD has its center at $(8,-8)$ and has an area of 4 square units. The top side of the square is horizontal. The square is then dilated with the dilation center at (0,0) and a scale factor of 2. What are the coordinates of the vertex of the image of square ABCD that is farthest from the origin? Give your answer as an ordered pair.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n With the center of dilation at the origin and a scale factor of 2, all the coordinates of square $ABCD$ are twice the coordinates of its preimage. The preimage has an area of 4 square units, so its side length is 2 units. Since the center of the preimage is at $(8, -8)$, the four vertices of the preimage are at $(7, -9), (7, -7), (9, -7)$ and $(9, -9)$. The point $(9, -9)$ is the farthest from the origin on the preimage, so the point farthest from the origin on the image of square $ABCD$ is $\\boxed{(18, -18)}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $A(-4,1), B(-1,4)$ and $C(-1,1)$ are the vertices of $\\triangle ABC$. What will be the coordinates of the image of point A if $\\triangle ABC$ is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n When we rotate images $90^{\\circ}$ the coordinates switch places, and the signs are adjusted based on whether or not an axis was crossed. In this case, rotating point $A$ $90^{\\circ}$ will bring it across the $y$-axis into Quadrant I, which means both the $x$ and $y$ will be positive. The original point $A$ was at $(-4, 1)$ so the final image will be at $(1, 4)$. We also could solve this problem by seeing that the slope of the segment from the origin to $A$ is $-1/4$. If $A$ is moving to a location that is a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation about the origin, it will move to a point on the segment perpendicular to the one that currently connects it to the origin. This will be the segment that has a slope of 4/1 or $-4/-1$ from the origin which puts us at $(1, 4)$ or $(-1, -4)$. The point $\\boxed{(1, 4)}$ is in the clockwise direction we need.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ with vertices $A(-2, 0)$, $B(1, 4)$ and $C(-3, 2)$ is reflected over the $y$-axis to form triangle $A'B'C'$. What is the length of a segment drawn from $C$ to $C'$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Reflecting a point over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coordinate.  So if $C$ is $(-3,2)$, $C'$ will be $(3,2)$.  The segment is a horizontal line of length $3+3=\\boxed{6}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ with vertices $A(1, -3)$, $B(-2, 0)$ and $C(4, 3)$ is reflected over the $y$-axis to form triangle $A'B'C'$. What is the length of a segment drawn from $A$ to $A'$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Reflecting a point over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coefficient.  So if $A$ is $(1,-3)$, $A'$ will be $(-1, -3)$.  The segment is a horizontal line of length $1+1=\\boxed{2}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The figure shown is a cube. The distance between vertices $B$ and $G$ is $5\\sqrt{2}$ units. What is the volume of the cube, in cubic units?\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(3cm,3cm);\n\npair A,B,C,D,a,b,c,d;\n\nA=(0,0);\nB=(1,0);\nC=(1,1);\nD=(0,1);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--A);\n\na=(-0.25,0.1);\nb=D+(A+a);\nc=C+(A+a);\n\ndraw(A--a);\n\ndraw(D--b);\n\ndraw(C--c);\n\ndraw(a--b--c);\n\ndraw(A--b,1pt+dotted);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\",b,W);\nlabel(\"$G$\",A,NE);\n\ndot(A);\ndot(b);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n $BG$ is a diagonal along one face of the cube. Since this diagonal splits the square face into two $45-45-90$ triangles, the diagonal is $\\sqrt{2}$ times longer than a side of the square, so a side of the square measures $5\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{2}=5$ units. Thus, the volume of the cube is $5^3=\\boxed{125}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The points $B(1, 1)$, $I(2, 4)$ and $G(5, 1)$ are plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system to form triangle $BIG$. Triangle $BIG$ is translated five units to the left and two units upward to triangle $B'I'G'$, in such a way that $B'$ is the image of $B$, $I'$ is the image of $I$, and $G'$ is the image of $G$. What is the midpoint of segment $B'G'$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since triangle $B^\\prime I^\\prime G^\\prime$ is translated from triangle $BIG,$ the midpoint of $B^\\prime G ^\\prime $ is the midpoint of $BG$ translated five units left and two units up. The midpoint of $BG$ is at $\\left( \\frac{1+5}{2}, \\frac{1+1}{2} \\right) = (3, 1).$ Thus, the midpoint of $B ^\\prime G ^\\prime$ is at $(3-5,1+2)=\\boxed{(-2,3)}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices at $A(5,8)$, $B(3,-2)$, and $C(6,1)$. The point $D$ with coordinates $(m,n)$ is chosen inside the triangle so that the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$ and $BCD$ all have equal areas. What is the value of $10m + n$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, then $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ would all have equal areas (to see this, remember that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into 6 equal areas). There is only one point with this property (if we move around $D$, the area of one of the small triangles will increase and will no longer be $1/3$ of the total area). So $D$ must be the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the centroid are found by averaging the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the vertices, so $(m,n) = \\left( \\frac{5+3+6}{3}, \\frac{8+(-2)+1}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$, and $10m + n = 10 \\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) + \\frac{7}{3} = \\boxed{49}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two vertices of an obtuse triangle are $(6,4)$ and $(0,0)$. The third vertex is located on the negative branch of the $x$-axis. What are the coordinates of the third vertex if the area of the triangle is 30 square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that, for a triangle, area = 1/2(base)(height), which equals 30 in this problem. We also know that the height of the triangle is 4 if we use the horizontal leg on the x-axis as the base. Now we can plug this information into the equation to find the length of the base that runs along the x-axis. The equation is $(1/2)(b)(4) = 30$, so $b = 30/2 = 15$. Since the 3rd vertex is on the x-axis we know that it extends straight left 15 units from the vertex at (0, 0), bringing us to the point $\\boxed{(-15, 0)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ with vertices at $A(1, 1)$, $B(1, -2)$ and $C(5, -2)$ is translated up 3 units and then dilated with respect to the origin by a factor of 2. What are the new coordinates of point $C$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.\n\nAnswer:\n",
