    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A bottled water company has designed a new cup for its dispenser. The cup will be a right circular cone with a three-inch radius. How tall will the cup need to be to hold 93 cubic inches of water? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\] Therefore, we want $h$ to satisfy \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot h \\ge 93,\\] or \\[h \\ge \\frac{93}{3 \\pi} \\approx 9.87.\\] Therefore, the height must be $\\boxed{10}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A spherical scoop of vanilla ice cream with radius of 2 inches is dropped onto the surface of a dish of hot chocolate sauce. As it melts, the ice cream spreads out uniformly forming a cylindrical region 8 inches in radius. Assuming the density of the ice cream remains constant, how many inches deep is the melted ice cream? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ice cream sphere has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3) = \\frac{32\\pi}{3}$ cubic inches.  Let the height of the cylindrical region be $h$; then, the volume of the cylindrical region is $\\pi (8^2)h=64\\pi h$.  Thus, we have \\[\\frac{32\\pi}{3} = 64\\pi h.\\] Dividing both sides by $64\\pi$ yields $h = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylindrical oil tank is $15$ feet tall and its circular bases have diameters of $4$ feet each. When the tank is lying flat on its side (not on one of the circular ends), the oil inside is $3$ feet deep. How deep, in feet, would the oil have been if the tank had been standing upright on one of its bases? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the oil is $3$ feet deep, we want to find the ratio of the area of the part of the circle covered with oil (part under the horizontal line of the figure below) to the entire area of the circle.\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2));\ndraw((-1.732,1)--(1.732,1));\ndraw((0,0)--(-1.732,1));\ndraw((0,0)--(1.732,1));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,1));\n[/asy] The two radii drawn makes a $120$ degree angle, so the area of the fraction of the circle covered by the oil is $\\frac23$ of the circle in addition to the isosceles triangle. We can find the length of half the base of the isosceles triangle by using the Pythagorean theorem on the smaller right triangle. Setting half the length of the base to $x$, we have $x^2+1=4$, so $x=\\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the base is $2\\sqrt3$. Therefore, we have that the area of the triangle is $\\frac12 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2\\sqrt3=\\sqrt3$. So, the area of the part of the circle that's covered in oil is $\\frac23 \\cdot 4\\pi + \\sqrt3=\\frac83\\pi+\\sqrt3$.\n\nThus, we have that the oil takes up $\\dfrac{\\frac83\\pi+\\sqrt3}{4\\pi} \\approx \\frac{10.11}{12.57} \\approx 0.805$ of the cylinder.\n\nWith the cylinder upright, the fraction of the cylinder the oil covers is the same as the fraction of the height the oil covers. Therefore, the oil would be $15 \\text{ feet} \\cdot 0.805 \\approx 12.08 \\approx \\boxed{12.1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cylindrical glass is half full of lemonade. The ratio of lemon juice to water in the lemonade is 1:11. If the glass is 6 inches tall and has a diameter of 2 inches, what is the volume of lemon juice in the glass? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can begin by calculating the volume of the liquid in the glass.  Since the glass is half full, the portion filled with liquid has height 3 inches.  The volume will be $\\pi r^2 h=\\pi\\cdot 1^2 \\cdot 3 = 3\\pi$.  Now, since the ratio of lemon juice to water is 1:11, the ratio of lemon juice to the liquid will be 1:(1+11) which is 1:12.  So, the volume of lemon juice in the glass is: $$3\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{12}=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\approx .7854$$ So, the answer is $\\boxed{.79}$ to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Either increasing the radius or the height of a cylinder by six inches will result in the same volume. The original height of the cylinder is two inches. What is the original radius in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the original radius be $r$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased radius is $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased height is $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Since we are told these two volumes are the same, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2 = \\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Simplifying, we have $(r+6)^2=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2+12r+36=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2-4r-12=0$. Factoring, we have $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=\\boxed{6}$ (it cannot be negative because it is a physical length).\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cylinders each have radius 8 inches and height 3 inches. The radius of one cylinder and the height of the other are both increased by the same nonzero number of inches. The resulting volumes are equal. How many inches is the increase? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the increase measure $x$ inches.  The cylinder with increased radius now has volume  \\[\\pi (8+x)^2 (3)\\] and the cylinder with increased height now has volume \\[\\pi (8^2) (3+x).\\] Setting these two quantities equal and solving yields  \\[3(64+16x+x^2)=64(3+x) \\Rightarrow 3x^2-16x=x(3x-16)=0\\] so $x=0$ or $x=16/3$.  The latter is the valid solution, so the increase measures $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The interior of a right, circular cone is 8 inches tall with a 2-inch radius at the opening. The interior of the cone is filled with ice cream, and the cone has a hemisphere of ice cream exactly covering the opening of the cone. What is the volume of ice cream? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of the cone is $\\frac13\\cdot4\\pi\\cdot8=\\frac{32}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches, and the volume of the hemisphere is $\\frac23\\cdot8\\pi=\\frac{16}{3}\\pi$. The sum is \\[\n\\left(\\frac{16}{3}+\\frac{32}{3}\\right)\\pi=\\boxed{16\\pi}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cone is inverted and filled with water to 3/4 of its height.  What percent of the cone's volume is filled with water?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest ten-thousandth.  (You should enter 10.0000 for $10\\%$ instead of 0.1000.)\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cone have height $h$ and radius $r$, so its volume is \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2h.\\]When the cone is filled with water, the amount of water in the cone forms a smaller cone that is similar to the original cone.  This smaller cone has height $\\frac{3}{4}h$, and by similar triangles, radius $\\frac{3}{4}r$.  So, the smaller cone has volume \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{4}r\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}h\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi \\cdot \\frac{3^3}{4^3} r^2h.\\]Hence the ratio of the volume of the water-filled cone to the original cone is \\[\\frac{3^3}{4^3}=\\frac{27}{64}=0.421875,\\]which, as a percentage, is $\\boxed{42.1875}\\%$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A spherical soap bubble lands on a horizontal wet surface and forms a hemisphere of the same volume. Given the radius of the hemisphere is $3\\sqrt[3]{2}$ cm, find the radius of the original bubble.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac43\\pi r^3$, so the volume of a hemisphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac23\\pi r^3$. Therefore if a hemisphere of radius $r$ has the same volume as a sphere of radius $R$, we get $\\frac43\\pi R^3=\\frac23 \\pi r^3$. Simplifying gives $R^3=\\frac12 r^3\\Rightarrow R=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}r$. We know that $r=3\\sqrt[3]{2}$ and that $R$ is the quantity we want to solve for, so substituting in our value of $r$ gives $R=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\cdot 3\\sqrt[3]{2}=\\boxed{3}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A hemispherical cup of radius 3 inches is filled with milk. The milk is then poured into a right cylindrical container of radius 2 inches. What is the minimum number of inches in the height of the container so it can hold all of the milk? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n\nAnswer:\n",
