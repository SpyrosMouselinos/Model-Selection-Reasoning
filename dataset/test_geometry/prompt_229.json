    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $ABC$ is a triangle: $A=(0,0), B=(36,15)$ and both the coordinates of $C$ are integers. What is the minimum area $\\triangle ABC$ can have?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{1}{2} \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 1 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{3}{2} \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{13}{2}\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{there is no minimum}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $C$ have coordinates $(p, q)$. Then by the Shoelace Formula, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{3}{2} \\lvert {12q-5p} \\rvert$. Since $p$ and $q$ are integers, $\\lvert {12q-5p} \\rvert$ is a positive integer, and by Bezout's Lemma, it can equal $1$ (e.g. with $q = 2, p = 5$), so the minimum area is $\\frac{3}{2} \\times 1 = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In parallelogram $ABCD$, $AB = 38$ cm, $BC = 3y^3$ cm, $CD = 2x +4$ cm, and $AD = 24$ cm. What is the product of $x$ and $y$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since opposite sides of a parallelogram have the same length, we have the equations $$AB=CD\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad38=2x+4\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad x=17$$and $$BC=AD\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad3y^3=24\\qquad\\Rightarrow\\qquad y=2.$$The product of $x$ and $y$ is then $17\\cdot2=\\boxed{34}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The coordinates of the vertices of isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$ are all integers, with $A=(20,100)$ and $D=(21,107)$. The trapezoid has no horizontal or vertical sides, and $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are the only parallel sides. The sum of the absolute values of all possible slopes for $\\overline{AB}$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n For simplicity, we translate the points so that $A$ is on the origin and $D = (1,7)$. Suppose $B$ has integer coordinates; then $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ is a vector with integer parameters (vector knowledge is not necessary for this solution). We construct the perpendicular from $A$ to $\\overline{CD}$, and let $D' = (a,b)$ be the reflection of $D$ across that perpendicular. Then $ABCD'$ is a parallelogram, and $\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\overrightarrow{D'C}$. Thus, for $C$ to have integer coordinates, it suffices to let $D'$ have integer coordinates.[1]\n[asy] pathpen = linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0), D=(1,7), Da = MP(\"D'\",D((-7,1)),N), B=(-8,-6), C=B+Da, F=foot(A,C,D); D(MP(\"A\",A)--MP(\"B\",B)--MP(\"C\",C,N)--MP(\"D\",D,N)--cycle); D(F--A--Da,linetype(\"4 4\"));  [/asy]\nLet the slope of the perpendicular be $m$. Then the midpoint of $\\overline{DD'}$ lies on the line $y=mx$, so $\\frac{b+7}{2} = m \\cdot \\frac{a+1}{2}$. Also, $AD = AD'$ implies that $a^2 + b^2 = 1^2 + 7^2 = 50$. Combining these two equations yields\n\\[a^2 + \\left(7 - (a+1)m\\right)^2 = 50\\]\nSince $a$ is an integer, then $7-(a+1)m$ must be an integer. There are $12$ pairs of integers whose squares sum up to $50,$ namely $( \\pm 1, \\pm 7), (\\pm 7, \\pm 1), (\\pm 5, \\pm 5)$. We exclude the cases $(\\pm 1, \\pm 7)$ because they lead to degenerate trapezoids (rectangle, line segment, vertical and horizontal sides). Thus we have\n\\[7 - 8m = \\pm 1, \\quad 7 + 6m = \\pm 1, \\quad 7 - 6m = \\pm 5, 7 + 4m = \\pm 5\\]\nThese yield $m = 1, \\frac 34, -1, -\\frac 43, 2, \\frac 13, -3, - \\frac 12$, and the sum of their absolute values is $\\frac{119}{12}$. The answer is $m+n= \\boxed{131}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let triangle $ABC$ be a right triangle in the xy-plane with a right angle at $C$. Given that the length of the hypotenuse $AB$ is $60$, and that the medians through $A$ and $B$ lie along the lines $y=x+3$ and $y=2x+4$ respectively, find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Translate so the medians are $y = x$, and $y = 2x$, then model the points $A: (a,a)$ and $B: (b,2b)$. $(0,0)$ is the centroid, and is the average of the vertices, so $C: (- a - b, - a - 2b)$\n$AB = 60$ so\n$3600 = (a - b)^2 + (2b - a)^2$\n$3600 = 2a^2 + 5b^2 - 6ab \\ \\ \\ \\ (1)$\n$AC$ and $BC$ are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes is $-1$, giving\n$\\left(\\frac {2a + 2b}{2a + b}\\right)\\left(\\frac {a + 4b}{a + 2b}\\right) = - 1$\n$2a^2 + 5b^2 = - \\frac {15}{2}ab \\ \\ \\ \\  (2)$\nCombining $(1)$ and $(2)$, we get $ab = - \\frac {800}{3}$\nUsing the determinant product for area of a triangle (this simplifies nicely, add columns 1 and 2, add rows 2 and 3), the area is $\\left|\\frac {3}{2}ab\\right|$, so we get the answer to be $\\boxed{400}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Tetrahedron $ABCD$ has $AD=BC=28$, $AC=BD=44$, and $AB=CD=52$. For any point $X$ in space, suppose $f(X)=AX+BX+CX+DX$. The least possible value of $f(X)$ can be expressed as $m\\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $M$ and $N$ be midpoints of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$. The given conditions imply that $\\triangle ABD\\cong\\triangle BAC$ and $\\triangle CDA\\cong\\triangle DCB$, and therefore $MC=MD$ and $NA=NB$. It follows that $M$ and $N$ both lie on the common perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$, and thus line $MN$ is that common perpendicular bisector. Points $B$ and $C$ are symmetric to $A$ and $D$ with respect to line $MN$. If $X$ is a point in space and $X'$ is the point symmetric to $X$ with respect to line $MN$, then $BX=AX'$ and $CX=DX'$, so $f(X) = AX+AX'+DX+DX'$.\nLet $Q$ be the intersection of $\\overline{XX'}$ and $\\overline{MN}$. Then $AX+AX'\\geq 2AQ$, from which it follows that $f(X) \\geq 2(AQ+DQ) = f(Q)$. It remains to minimize $f(Q)$ as $Q$ moves along $\\overline{MN}$.\nAllow $D$ to rotate about $\\overline{MN}$ to point $D'$ in the plane $AMN$ on the side of $\\overline{MN}$ opposite $A$. Because $\\angle DNM$ is a right angle, $D'N=DN$. It then follows that $f(Q) = 2(AQ+D'Q)\\geq 2AD'$, and equality occurs when $Q$ is the intersection of $\\overline{AD'}$ and $\\overline{MN}$. Thus $\\min f(Q) = 2AD'$. Because $\\overline{MD}$ is the median of $\\triangle ADB$, the Length of Median Formula shows that $4MD^2 = 2AD^2 + 2BD^2 - AB^2 = 2\\cdot 28^2 + 2 \\cdot 44^2 - 52^2$ and $MD^2 = 684$. By the Pythagorean Theorem $MN^2 = MD^2 - ND^2 = 8$.\nBecause $\\angle AMN$ and $\\angle D'NM$ are right angles,\\[(AD')^2 = (AM+D'N)^2 + MN^2 = (2AM)^2 + MN^2 = 52^2 + 8 = 4\\cdot 678.\\]It follows that $\\min f(Q) = 2AD' = 4\\sqrt{678}$. The requested sum is $4+678=\\boxed{682}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circles $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{2}$ intersect at two points, one of which is $(9,6)$, and the product of the radii is $68$. The x-axis and the line $y = mx$, where $m > 0$, are tangent to both circles. It is given that $m$ can be written in the form $a\\sqrt {b}/c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, and $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime. Find $a + b + c$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the smaller angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$ be $\\theta$. Note that the centers of the two circles lie on the angle bisector of the angle between the $x$-axis and the line $y=mx$. Also note that if $(x,y)$ is on said angle bisector, we have that $\\frac{y}{x}=\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}$. Let $\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=m_1$, for convenience. Therefore if $(x,y)$ is on the angle bisector, then $x=\\frac{y}{m_1}$. Now let the centers of the two relevant circles be $(a/m_1 , a)$ and $(b/m_1 , b)$ for some positive reals $a$ and $b$. These two circles are tangent to the $x$-axis, so the radii of the circles are $a$ and $b$ respectively. We know that the point $(9,6)$ is a point on both circles, so we have that\n\\[(9-\\frac{a}{m_1})^2+(6-a)^2=a^2\\]\n\\[(9-\\frac{b}{m_1})^2+(6-b)^2=b^2\\]\nExpanding these and manipulating terms gives\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}a^2-[(18/m_1)+12]a+117=0\\]\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}b^2-[(18/m_1)+12]b+117=0\\]\nIt follows that $a$ and $b$ are the roots of the quadratic\n\\[\\frac{1}{m_1^2}x^2-[(18/m_1)+12]x+117=0\\]\nIt follows from Vieta's Formulas that the product of the roots of this quadratic is $117m_1^2$, but we were also given that the product of the radii was 68. Therefore $68=117m_1^2$, or $m_1^2=\\frac{68}{117}$. Note that the half-angle formula for tangents is\n\\[\\tan{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}}\\]\nTherefore\n\\[\\frac{68}{117}=\\frac{1-\\cos{\\theta}}{1+\\cos{\\theta}}\\]\nSolving for $\\cos{\\theta}$ gives that $\\cos{\\theta}=\\frac{49}{185}$. It then follows that $\\sin{\\theta}=\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2{\\theta}}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{185}$.\nIt then follows that $m=\\tan{\\theta}=\\frac{12\\sqrt{221}}{49}$. Therefore $a=12$, $b=221$, and $c=49$. The desired answer is then $12+221+49=\\boxed{282}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The rectangle with vertices $(-1, y), (7, y), (-1, 3)$, and $(7, 3)$ has an area of 72 square units, and $y$ is positive. What is the value of $y$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First we write the rectangle's side lengths in terms of the coordinates provided. The length is $7-(-1)=8$ and the height is $y-3.$ It follows that $8(y-3)=72,$ and $y=\\boxed{12}.$ [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(4cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nxaxis(Arrows(4));\nyaxis(ymin=-2,Arrows(4));\npair A=(-1,12), B=(7,12), C=(-1,3), D=(7,3);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--D--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$8$\",(A+B)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$y-3$\",(B+D)/2,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In convex quadrilateral $ABCD$, $AB=8$, $BC=4$, $CD=DA=10$, and $\\angle CDA=60^\\circ$.  If the area of $ABCD$ can be written in the form $\\sqrt{a}+b\\sqrt{c}$ where $a$ and $c$ have no perfect square factors (greater than 1), what is $a+b+c$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We begin by drawing a diagram: [asy]\npair A,B,C,D;\nA=(0,5*sqrt(3));\nB=(10-13/5,5*sqrt(3)+(1/5)*sqrt(231));\nC=(10,5*sqrt(3));\nD=(5,0);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$B$\",B,N); label(\"$C$\",C,E); label(\"$D$\",D,S);\ndraw(A--C);\nlabel(\"$60^\\circ$\",(5,1.8));\nlabel(\"$8$\",(A--B),NW); label(\"$4$\",(B--C),NE); label(\"$10$\",(C--D),SE); label(\"$10$\",(D--A),SW);\n[/asy] Since $\\angle CDA=60^\\circ$ and $AD=DC$, $\\triangle ACD$ is an equilateral triangle, so $AC=10$ and \\[[\\triangle ACD]=\\frac{10^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}=25\\sqrt{3}.\\]Now we want to find $[\\triangle ABC]$.

Using the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle BCE$ yields \\[x^2+h^2=16\\]and on $\\triangle ABE$ yields \\[(10-x)^2+h^2=64.\\]Expanding the second equation yields $x^2-20x+100+h^2=64$; substituting $16$ for $x^2+h^2$ yields $16+100-20x=64$.  Solving yields $x=\\frac{13}{5}$ and $h=\\sqrt{16-x^2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{231}}{5}$.  It follows that \\[[\\triangle ABC]= \\frac{1}{2}(BE)(AC)=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{231}}{5}\\cdot 10 = \\sqrt{231}.\\]Finally, \\[[ABCD]=[\\triangle ADC]+[\\triangle ABC]=25\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{231}=\\sqrt{a}+b\\sqrt{c}.\\]Thus we see $a=231$, $b=25$, and $c=3$, so $a+b+c=\\boxed{259}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Each vertex of this parallelogram has integer coordinates. The perimeter of this parallelogram is $p$ units, while the area is $a$ square units. What is the value of the sum $p + a$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(5cm,5cm);\ndraw((-2,0)--(11,0));\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,4)--(10,4)--(7,0)--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(3,4)$\",(3,4),NW);\nlabel(\"$(7,0)$\",(7,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the bottom side of the parallelogram is 7 units, and the length of the left side of the parallelogram is $\\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5$ units, by the Pythagorean theorem.  Since the opposite two sides are congruent to these two, the perimeter of the parallelogram is $5+7+5+7=24$ units.  The area of the parallelogram is equal to its base times its height, which is $(7)(4)=28$ square units.  Therefore, $p+a=24+28=\\boxed{52}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ lies in the cartesian plane and has an area of $70$. The coordinates of $B$ and $C$ are $(12,19)$ and $(23,20),$ respectively, and the coordinates of $A$ are $(p,q).$ The line containing the median to side $BC$ has slope $-5.$ Find the largest possible value of $p+q.$\n[asy]defaultpen(fontsize(8)); size(170); pair A=(15,32), B=(12,19), C=(23,20), M=B/2+C/2, P=(17,22); draw(A--B--C--A);draw(A--M);draw(B--P--C); label(\"A (p,q)\",A,(1,1));label(\"B (12,19)\",B,(-1,-1));label(\"C (23,20)\",C,(1,-1));label(\"M\",M,(0.2,-1)); label(\"(17,22)\",P,(1,1)); dot(A^^B^^C^^M^^P);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The midpoint $M$ of line segment $\\overline{BC}$ is $\\left(\\frac{35}{2}, \\frac{39}{2}\\right)$. The equation of the median can be found by $-5 = \\frac{q - \\frac{39}{2}}{p - \\frac{35}{2}}$. Cross multiply and simplify to yield that $-5p + \\frac{35 \\cdot 5}{2} = q - \\frac{39}{2}$, so $q = -5p + 107$.\nUse determinants to find that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\begin{vmatrix}p & 12 & 23 \\\\  q & 19 & 20 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1\\end{vmatrix} = 70$ (note that there is a missing absolute value; we will assume that the other solution for the triangle will give a smaller value of $p+q$, which is provable by following these steps over again). We can calculate this determinant to become $140 = \\begin{vmatrix} 12 & 23 \\\\ 19 & 20 \\end{vmatrix} - \\begin{vmatrix} p & q \\\\ 23 & 20 \\end{vmatrix} + \\begin{vmatrix} p & q \\\\ 12 & 19 \\end{vmatrix}$ $\\Longrightarrow 140 = 240 - 437 - 20p + 23q + 19p - 12q$ $= -197 - p + 11q$. Thus, $q = \\frac{1}{11}p - \\frac{337}{11}$.\nSetting this equation equal to the equation of the median, we get that $\\frac{1}{11}p - \\frac{337}{11} = -5p + 107$, so $\\frac{56}{11}p = \\frac{107 \\cdot 11 + 337}{11}$. Solving produces that $p = 15$. Substituting backwards yields that $q = 32$; the solution is $p + q = \\boxed{47}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The parallelogram bounded by the lines $y=ax+c$, $y=ax+d$, $y=bx+c$, and $y=bx+d$ has area 18.
