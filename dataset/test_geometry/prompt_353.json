    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylindrical oil tank is $15$ feet tall and its circular bases have diameters of $4$ feet each. When the tank is lying flat on its side (not on one of the circular ends), the oil inside is $3$ feet deep. How deep, in feet, would the oil have been if the tank had been standing upright on one of its bases? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the oil is $3$ feet deep, we want to find the ratio of the area of the part of the circle covered with oil (part under the horizontal line of the figure below) to the entire area of the circle.\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2));\ndraw((-1.732,1)--(1.732,1));\ndraw((0,0)--(-1.732,1));\ndraw((0,0)--(1.732,1));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,1));\n[/asy] The two radii drawn makes a $120$ degree angle, so the area of the fraction of the circle covered by the oil is $\\frac23$ of the circle in addition to the isosceles triangle. We can find the length of half the base of the isosceles triangle by using the Pythagorean theorem on the smaller right triangle. Setting half the length of the base to $x$, we have $x^2+1=4$, so $x=\\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the base is $2\\sqrt3$. Therefore, we have that the area of the triangle is $\\frac12 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2\\sqrt3=\\sqrt3$. So, the area of the part of the circle that's covered in oil is $\\frac23 \\cdot 4\\pi + \\sqrt3=\\frac83\\pi+\\sqrt3$.\n\nThus, we have that the oil takes up $\\dfrac{\\frac83\\pi+\\sqrt3}{4\\pi} \\approx \\frac{10.11}{12.57} \\approx 0.805$ of the cylinder.\n\nWith the cylinder upright, the fraction of the cylinder the oil covers is the same as the fraction of the height the oil covers. Therefore, the oil would be $15 \\text{ feet} \\cdot 0.805 \\approx 12.08 \\approx \\boxed{12.1}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cylinder with its diameter equal to its height is inscribed in a right circular cone. The cone has diameter 10 and altitude 12, and the axes of the cylinder and cone coincide. Find the radius of the cylinder. Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cylinder have radius $r$ and height $2r$. Since $\\triangle APQ$ is similar to $\\triangle AOB$, we have $$\\frac{12-2r}{r} = \\frac{12}{5}, \\text{ so } r = \\boxed{\\frac{30}{11}}.$$[asy]\ndraw((0,2)..(-6,0)--(6,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,-2)..(-6,0)--(6,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,1)..(-3,0)--(3,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,-1)..(-3,0)--(3,0)..cycle);\nfill((-6,0.01)--(-6,-0.01)--(6,-0.01)--(6,0.01)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,14)--(0,0)--(6,0),dashed);\ndraw((0,8)..(-3,7)--(3,7)..cycle);\ndraw((0,6)..(-3,7)--(3,7)..cycle);\nfill((-3,7.01)--(-3,6.99)--(3,6.99)--(3,7.01)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,7)--(3,7),dashed);\ndraw((-6,0)--(0,14)--(6,0));\ndraw((-3,0)--(-3,7));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,7));\nlabel(\"{\\tiny O}\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny B}\",(6,0),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny P}\",(0,7),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny Q}\",(3,7),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny A}\",(0,14),E);\ndraw((0,-2.5)--(6,-2.5),Arrows);\ndraw((-6.5,0)--(-6.5,14),Arrows);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 5}\",(3,-2.5),S);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12}\",(-6.5,7),W);\ndraw((10,0)--(15,0)--(10,12)--cycle);\ndraw((10,6)--(12.5,6));\ndraw((15.5,0)--(15.5,12),Arrows);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny O}\",(10,0),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny P}\",(10,6),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny A}\",(10,12),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 2r}\",(10,3),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12-2r}\",(10,9),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny B}\",(15,0),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny Q}\",(12.5,6),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12}\",(15.5,6),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 5}\",(12.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two cylindrical cans have the same volume. The height of one can is triple the height of the other. If the radius of the narrower can is 12 units, how many units are in the length of the radius of the wider can? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the wide can be $h$ and the height of the narrow can be $3h$.  Let the wide can have radius $x$ units.  Since the two volumes are equal, we have \\[\\pi (12^2) (3h) = \\pi (x^2) (h).\\] Solving yields $x = 12\\sqrt{3}$ so the wide can has radius $\\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylinder with a base radius of 3 units is inscribed in a sphere of radius 5 units. The total volume, in cubic units, of the space inside the sphere and outside the cylinder is $W\\pi$.  Find $W$, as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To begin, we need to visualize the cylinder inscribed in the sphere.  We can draw the cylinder as shown: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(6,0)--(6,8)--(0,8)--cycle,linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,8)--(6,0),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,0)..(3,-1.5)..(6,0),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,0)..(3,1.5)..(6,0),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,8)..(3,9.5)..(6,8),linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,8)..(3,6.5)..(6,8),linewidth(.7));\nlabel(\"6\",(3,8),N);\nlabel(\"10\",(3,4),NE);\n[/asy] A diagonal drawn in the cylinder will have length 10, which is the diameter of the sphere.  We can see that a 6-8-10 right triangle is formed by the height of the cylinder, the diameter of the sphere, and the diameter of the base of the cylinder.  Now that we know the height of the cylinder, we have everything we need to compute the desired volume: $$V_{sphere}=\\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\cdot \\pi\\cdot 5^3=\\frac{500\\pi}{3}$$$$V_{cylinder}=\\pi r^2\\cdot h=\\pi \\cdot 3^2\\cdot 8=72\\pi .$$The volume inside the sphere and outside the cylinder is the difference of the above values: $$V_{sphere}-V_{cylinder}=\\frac{500\\pi}{3}-72\\pi =\\frac{500\\pi-216\\pi}{3}=\\boxed{\\frac{284}{3}}\\pi .$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The water tank in the diagram below is in the shape of an inverted right circular cone. The radius of its base is 16 feet, and its height is 96 feet. The water in the tank is $25\\%$ of the tank's capacity.  The height of the water in the tank can be written in the form $a\\sqrt[3]{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by a perfect cube greater than 1.  What is $a+b$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8pt)+fontsize(8pt));\n\ndraw(shift(0,96)*yscale(0.5)*Circle((0,0),16));\ndraw((-16,96)--(0,0)--(16,96)--(0,96));\n\ndraw(scale(0.75)*shift(0,96)*yscale(0.5)*Circle((0,0),16));\n\ndraw((-18,72)--(-20,72)--(-20,0)--(-18,0));\nlabel(\"water's height\",(-20,36),W);\n\ndraw((20,96)--(22,96)--(22,0)--(20,0));\nlabel(\"96'\",(22,48),E);\n\nlabel(\"16'\",(8,96),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The water in the tank fills a cone, which we will refer to as the water cone, that is similar to the cone-shaped tank itself.  Let the scale factor between the water cone and tank be $x$, so the height of the water cone is $96x$ feet and the radius of the water cone is $16x$ feet.  It follows that the volume of the water cone is $(1/3)\\pi(16x)^2(96x)$ cubic feet.\n\nThe volume of the cone-shaped tank is $(1/3)\\pi(16^2)(96)$.  Since the water cone has $25\\%$ or 1/4 of the volume of the tank, we have  \\[(1/3)\\pi(16x)^2(96x) = (1/4) (1/3)\\pi(16^2)(96).\\]  Simplifying yields $x^3 = 1/4$, so $x = \\sqrt[3]{1/4}$.\n\nFinally, the height of the water in the tank is the height of the water cone, which is  \\[96x=96\\sqrt[3]{1/4}=48\\cdot 2\\sqrt[3]{1/4}=48\\sqrt[3]{(1/4)(8)}={48\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\] feet.  Therefore, we have $a+b=48+2 = \\boxed{50}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone has a volume of $12\\pi$ cubic centimeters. The height of the cone is 4 cm. How many centimeters is the circumference of the base of the cone, in terms of $\\pi$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. We're given that the volume is $12\\pi$ and the height is $4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 = 12\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$. Therefore, the circumference of the base is $2\\pi r = \\boxed{6\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many cubic feet are in the volume of a round swimming pool which is 16 feet in diameter and 4 feet deep throughout? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The radius of this pool is $16/2=8$ feet; the volume of this pool is thus $\\pi(8^2)(4)=\\boxed{256\\pi}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylinder with a height of 5 inches has a radius of 2 inches. What is the area of the curved surface of the cylinder, in square inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The lateral area of a cylinder is $2\\pi rh$. Since $h = 5$ and $r = 2$, our answer is $2\\pi\\cdot 2\\cdot 5 = \\boxed{20\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When the height of a cylinder is doubled and its radius is increased by $200\\%$, the cylinder's volume is multiplied by a factor of $X$. What is the value of $X$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylinder's original volume is $\\pi r^2h$. The new height is $2h$ and the new radius is $r+\\frac{200}{100}r=3r$. That means the new volume is $\\pi (3r)^2(2h)=\\pi r^2h(9)(2)$. The new volume is the original volume multiplied by a factor of $\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylindrical tank with circular bases is being filled with water at a rate of $20\\pi$ cubic meters per hour. As the tank is filled, the water level rises four meters per hour. What is the radius of the tank, in meters? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\nAnswer:\n",
