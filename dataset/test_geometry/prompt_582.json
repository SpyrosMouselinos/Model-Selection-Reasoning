    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The sum of the lengths of all the edges of a cube is 60 cm. Find the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cube.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since there are 12 congruent edges on a cube, each edge has length $60/12=5$ cm. Since the volume of the cube is equal to the edge length cubed, the volume is $5^3=5\\cdot5\\cdot5=\\boxed{125}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has a surface area of 216 square centimeters. What is the volume of the cube, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are 6 faces to a cube, meaning that each face has area 36, and the edge has length 6, for a total volume of $6^3 = \\boxed{216}$ for the cube.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. Given that one edge of the cube is 6 inches, how many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(70);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy] A sphere inscribed in a cube has diameter length equal to the side length of the cube.  Thus, the inscribed sphere has diameter 6 inches, radius $6/2=3$ inches, and volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3)^3=4\\cdot 3^2\\pi=\\boxed{36\\pi}\\] cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume, in cubic units, of a cube whose surface area is 600 square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The surface area of a cube equals 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces). If the cube has a sidelength of $s$, then the surface area equals $6s^2$. We set that equal to 600 and solve for $s$, which must be positive. $$600=6s^2\\qquad\\Rightarrow 100=s^2\\qquad\\Rightarrow 10=s$$ The volume of the cube is $s^3=10^3=\\boxed{1000}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The surface area of a particular sphere is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone having a diameter of 10cm and a height of 6cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The radius of the base of the cone is $10/2 = 5$, so the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{50 \\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a given sphere is $36\\pi$ cubic inches. How many square inches are in its surface area? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Here, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=36\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\\pi(3^2)=\\boxed{36\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is cut into four congruent wedges. The circumference of the sphere is $12\\pi$ inches. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one wedge? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the sphere.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sphere's radius be $r$.  From the sphere's circumference we have $2\\pi r = 12\\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r = 6$.  The volume of the sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6^3) = 36\\cdot 8 \\pi$.  The volume of one wedge is one-fourth this volume, or $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 6^2\\cdot 8 \\pi = 6^2\\cdot 2\\pi = \\boxed{72\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cones with radius 12 cm and height 12 cm are enclosed within a cylinder. The base of each cone is a base of the cylinder, and the height of the cylinder is 24 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cylinder not occupied by the cones? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylinder has volume $\\pi (12)^2 (24)$ cubic cm.  Each cone has volume $(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12)$ cubic cm.  Hence the volume of the space in the cylinder not occupied by the cones is  \\begin{align*}\n\\pi (12)^2 (24) - (2)(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12) &= 12^3\\pi(2-2/3)\\\\\n&=12^3\\pi(4/3)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{2304\\pi} \\text{ cubic cm}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a cylinder is 60 cubic centimeters.
