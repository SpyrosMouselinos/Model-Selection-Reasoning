    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has three different integer side lengths and a perimeter of 20 units. What is the maximum length of any one side?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A triangle with sides of 9,8 and 3 will satisfy these conditions.  This will have longest side of 9.  If the longest side has length 10, then the sum of the remaining two sides $x+y$ must be greater than 10 by the triangle inequality.  However, this cannot be since this will equal 10, and thus, the maximum length of one side is $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are consecutive whole numbers is 29 units. What is the sum of the lengths of the two legs?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let's call the length of the shorter leg $x$. Then the length of the longer leg is $x + 1$. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we write the equation $x^2 + (x + 1)^2 = 29^2$ and solve for $x$. Expanding $(x + 1)^2$, we get $x\n^2 + x^2 + 2x + 1 = 841$. This can be simplified to $2x^2 + 2x = 840$, or $x^2 + x = 420$. Factoring out $x$ on the left, we can rewrite it as $x(x + 1) = 420$. In other words, the product of these two consecutive numbers is 420, which means they must each be close to the square root of 420. Indeed, $20 \\times 21 = 420$, so the legs must be 20 and 21. Their sum is $20 + 21 = \\boxed{41}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right triangle has a side length of 21 inches and a hypotenuse of 29 inches. A second triangle is similar to the first and has a hypotenuse of 87 inches. What is the length of the shortest side of the second triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we calculate that the other leg of the original right triangle must be $$\\sqrt{29^2 - 21^2} = \\sqrt{841 - 441} = \\sqrt{400} = 20$$ inches. Since 87 is 3 times 29, the length of the shortest side of the second triangle must be $3 \\times 20 = \\boxed{60\\text{ inches}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 33 units and 42 units. The third side also has an integral length. What is the least possible number of units in the perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The sum of the smaller two sides must exceed the greatest side, so if $x$ is the missing side then $x+33>42\\implies x>9$.  The smallest integer greater than 9 is 10, so the least perimeter is $10+33+42=\\boxed{85}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is three times as long as a second  side, and the length of the third side is 15. What is the greatest possible perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $x$, $3x$, and 15. The Triangle Inequality implies that $3x<x+15$, so $x<7.5$. Because $x$ is an integer, the greatest possible perimeter is $7+21+15=\\boxed{43}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If a triangle has two sides of lengths 5 and 7 units, then how many different integer lengths can the third side be?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $n$ be the length of the third side.  Then by the triangle inequality, \\begin{align*}\nn + 5 &> 7, \\\\\nn + 7 &> 5, \\\\\n5 + 7 &> n,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $n > 2$, $n > -2$, and $n < 12$.  Hence, the possible values of $n$ are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, for a total of $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many different isosceles triangles have integer side lengths and perimeter 23?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because the perimeter of such a triangle is 23, and the sum of the two equal side lengths is even, the length of the base is odd. Also, the length of the base is less than the sum of the other two side lengths, so it is less than half of 23. Thus the $\\boxed{6}$ possible triangles have side lengths 1, 11, 11; 3, 10, 10; 5, 9, 9; 7, 8, 8; 9, 7, 7 and 11, 6, 6.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the smallest possible perimeter, in units, of a triangle whose side-length measures are consecutive integer values?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The smallest such triangle has lengths 1, 2, and 3. However, this triangle doesn't work since the sum of any two side lengths must be greater than the third side length (by the Triangle Inequality). The next smallest triangle has lengths 2, 3, and 4, which works. Thus, the smallest possible perimeter is $2+3+4=\\boxed{9}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC,\\,$ angle $C$ is a right angle and the altitude from $C\\,$ meets $\\overline{AB}\\,$ at $D.\\,$ The lengths of the sides of $\\triangle ABC\\,$ are integers, $BD=29^3,\\,$ and $\\cos B=m/n\\,$, where $m\\,$ and $n\\,$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.\\,$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle CBD$, we have $\\frac{BC}{AB} = \\frac{29^3}{BC} \\Longrightarrow BC^2 = 29^3 AB$. It follows that $29^2 | BC$ and $29 | AB$, so $BC$ and $AB$ are in the form $29^2 x$ and $29 x^2$, respectively, where x is an integer.\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, we find that $AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 \\Longrightarrow (29^2x)^2 + AC^2 = (29 x^2)^2$, so $29x | AC$. Letting $y = AC / 29x$, we obtain after dividing through by $(29x)^2$, $29^2 = x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)$. As $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, the pairs of factors of $29^2$ are $(1,29^2)(29,29)$; clearly $y = \\frac{AC}{29x} \\neq 0$, so $x-y = 1, x+y= 29^2$. Then, $x = \\frac{1+29^2}{2} = 421$.\nThus, $\\cos B = \\frac{BC}{AB} = \\frac{29^2 x}{29x^2} = \\frac{29}{421}$, and $m+n = \\boxed{450}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two sides of a triangle have lengths of 18 and 29 units. If the third side has an integer length, what is the positive difference between the maximum and minimum length of the third side?\n\nAnswer:\n",
