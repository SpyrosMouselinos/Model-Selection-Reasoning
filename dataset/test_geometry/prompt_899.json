    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cylindrical glass is half full of lemonade. The ratio of lemon juice to water in the lemonade is 1:11. If the glass is 6 inches tall and has a diameter of 2 inches, what is the volume of lemon juice in the glass? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can begin by calculating the volume of the liquid in the glass.  Since the glass is half full, the portion filled with liquid has height 3 inches.  The volume will be $\\pi r^2 h=\\pi\\cdot 1^2 \\cdot 3 = 3\\pi$.  Now, since the ratio of lemon juice to water is 1:11, the ratio of lemon juice to the liquid will be 1:(1+11) which is 1:12.  So, the volume of lemon juice in the glass is: $$3\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{12}=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\approx .7854$$ So, the answer is $\\boxed{.79}$ to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cylinders each have radius 8 inches and height 3 inches. The radius of one cylinder and the height of the other are both increased by the same nonzero number of inches. The resulting volumes are equal. How many inches is the increase? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the increase measure $x$ inches.  The cylinder with increased radius now has volume  \\[\\pi (8+x)^2 (3)\\] and the cylinder with increased height now has volume \\[\\pi (8^2) (3+x).\\] Setting these two quantities equal and solving yields  \\[3(64+16x+x^2)=64(3+x) \\Rightarrow 3x^2-16x=x(3x-16)=0\\] so $x=0$ or $x=16/3$.  The latter is the valid solution, so the increase measures $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A bottled water company has designed a new cup for its dispenser. The cup will be a right circular cone with a three-inch radius. How tall will the cup need to be to hold 93 cubic inches of water? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\] Therefore, we want $h$ to satisfy \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot h \\ge 93,\\] or \\[h \\ge \\frac{93}{3 \\pi} \\approx 9.87.\\] Therefore, the height must be $\\boxed{10}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Either increasing the radius or the height of a cylinder by six inches will result in the same volume. The original height of the cylinder is two inches. What is the original radius in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the original radius be $r$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased radius is $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased height is $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Since we are told these two volumes are the same, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2 = \\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Simplifying, we have $(r+6)^2=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2+12r+36=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2-4r-12=0$. Factoring, we have $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=\\boxed{6}$ (it cannot be negative because it is a physical length).\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two cylindrical cans have the same volume. The height of one can is triple the height of the other. If the radius of the narrower can is 12 units, how many units are in the length of the radius of the wider can? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the wide can be $h$ and the height of the narrow can be $3h$.  Let the wide can have radius $x$ units.  Since the two volumes are equal, we have \\[\\pi (12^2) (3h) = \\pi (x^2) (h).\\] Solving yields $x = 12\\sqrt{3}$ so the wide can has radius $\\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A spherical scoop of vanilla ice cream with radius of 2 inches is dropped onto the surface of a dish of hot chocolate sauce. As it melts, the ice cream spreads out uniformly forming a cylindrical region 8 inches in radius. Assuming the density of the ice cream remains constant, how many inches deep is the melted ice cream? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ice cream sphere has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3) = \\frac{32\\pi}{3}$ cubic inches.  Let the height of the cylindrical region be $h$; then, the volume of the cylindrical region is $\\pi (8^2)h=64\\pi h$.  Thus, we have \\[\\frac{32\\pi}{3} = 64\\pi h.\\] Dividing both sides by $64\\pi$ yields $h = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Jimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Increasing the radius of a cylinder by $6$ units increased the volume by $y$ cubic units. Increasing the height of the cylinder by $6$ units also increases the volume by $y$ cubic units. If the original height is $2$, then the original radius is:\n$\\text{(A) } 2 \\qquad \\text{(B) } 4 \\qquad \\text{(C) } 6 \\qquad \\text{(D) } 6\\pi \\qquad \\text{(E) } 8$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that the volume of a cylinder is equal to $\\pi r^2h$, where $r$ and $h$ are the radius and height, respectively. So we know that $2\\pi (r+6)^2-2\\pi r^2=y=\\pi r^2(2+6)-2\\pi r^2$. Expanding and rearranging, we get that $2\\pi (12r+36)=6\\pi r^2$. Divide both sides by $6\\pi$ to get that $4r+12=r^2$, and rearrange to see that $r^2-4r-12=0$. This factors to become $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=6$ or $r=-2$. Obviously, the radius cannot be negative, so our answer is $\\boxed{6}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A jar of peanut butter which is 3 inches in diameter and 4 inches high sells for $\\$$0.60. At the same rate, what would be the price for a jar that is 6 inches in diameter and 6 inches high?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The first jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{3}{2})^24=9\\pi$. The second jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{6}{2})^26=54\\pi$. Note that the volume of the second jar is 6 times greater than that of the first jar. Because peanut butter is sold by volume, the second jar will be six times more expensive than the first jar, for an answer of $\\$0.60\\times6=\\boxed{\\$3.60}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n P.J. has a cylindrical mug with a 3-inch diameter. His mug is filled to a height of 6 inches with grape juice. Schuyler has a cylindrical mug with a 4-inch diameter. To what height in inches must Schuyler's mug be filled so that he receives the same amount of juice as P.J.? Express your answer as a mixed number.\n\nAnswer:\n",
