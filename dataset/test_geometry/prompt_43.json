    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n For $x > 0$, the area of the triangle with vertices $(0, 0), (x, 2x)$, and $(x, 0)$ is 64 square units. What is the value of $x$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the given points, we find that the triangle is a right triangle whose legs measure $x$ and $2x$ units.  Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(2x)=64$, which we solve to find $x=\\boxed{8}$ units. [asy]\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nreal x=8;\npair A=(0,0), B=(x,2*x), C=(x,0);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nxaxis(-2,10,Arrows(4));\nyaxis(-2,20,Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"$(x,0)$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$(x,2x)$\",B,N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of rectangle $ABCD$ with vertices $A$(0, 0), $B$(0, 4), $C$($x$, 4) and $D$($x$, 0) is 28 square units. If $x > 0$, what is the value of $x$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the points, we see that the dimensions of the rectangle are $x$ and $4$.  The area of the rectangle is $(\\text{length})(\\text{width})=4x$, so $4x=28$ and $x=\\boxed{7}$. [asy]\nsize(5cm);\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(12));\nreal x = 7;\npair A=(0,0), B=(0,4), C=(x,4), D=(x,0);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\nxaxis(-2,9,Arrows(4));\nyaxis(-2,7,Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,SE);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(B+C)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$4$\",(C+D)/2,E);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,5)$, and $(7,12)$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The base of the triangle lies on the $y$-axis, and is 5 units long. The height of the triangle is the horizontal distance from the point $(7,12)$ to the $y$-axis, and is 7 units long. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{5\\cdot7}{2}=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has vertices at $(-3,2),(6,-2),(3,5)$. How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(200);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nreal x = 7;\npair A=(-3,2), B=(6,-2), C=(3,5);\nfill(A--C--(-3,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(B--C--(6,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(A--B--(-3,-2)--cycle,gray(0.6));\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\nxaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\nyaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(-3,2)$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$(6,-2)$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$(3,5)$\",C,N);\ndraw((-3,5)--(6,5)--(6,-2)--(-3,-2)--cycle,dotted);[/asy] We find the area of the given triangle by subtracting the sum of the areas of the three shaded triangles in the figure from the area of the rectangle formed by all four triangles.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $9(7)=63$ square units, and the sum of the areas of the shaded triangles is $$\\frac{1}{2}(6)(3)+\\frac{1}{2}(3)(7)+\\frac{1}{2}(4)(9)=37.5$$ square units.  The area of the fourth triangle is $63-37.5=\\boxed{25.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two vertices of an obtuse triangle are $(6,4)$ and $(0,0)$. The third vertex is located on the negative branch of the $x$-axis. What are the coordinates of the third vertex if the area of the triangle is 30 square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that, for a triangle, area = 1/2(base)(height), which equals 30 in this problem. We also know that the height of the triangle is 4 if we use the horizontal leg on the x-axis as the base. Now we can plug this information into the equation to find the length of the base that runs along the x-axis. The equation is $(1/2)(b)(4) = 30$, so $b = 30/2 = 15$. Since the 3rd vertex is on the x-axis we know that it extends straight left 15 units from the vertex at (0, 0), bringing us to the point $\\boxed{(-15, 0)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle in a Cartesian coordinate plane has vertices (5, -2), (10, 5) and (5, 5). How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the given points in a coordinate plane, we find that the triangle is a right triangle whose legs have length $5-(-2)=7$ and $10-5=5$ units.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(7)(5)=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(8));\ndotfactor = 4;\ndraw((-1,0)--(10,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,10),Arrows(4));\npair A=(5,-2), B=(10,5), C=(5,5);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(rotate(90)*\"$5-(-2)$\",(0,0.2)+(A+C)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$10-5$\",(B+C)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$(5,-2)$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$(10,5)$\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"$(5,5)$\",C,NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle whose vertices are at $(4, -1)$, $(10, 3)$ and $(4, 5)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$.  Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units. The length of the third side is $x$ units, where $x$ is an integer. What is the largest possible perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If a triangle has sides of length 5 and 6 units, that means the third side must be smaller than 11 units. Since the third side is also an integer length, that means the third side can be at most 10 units. Verifying that 5 units, 6 units, and 10 units do make a valid triangle, we can see that the largest possible perimeter is $5 + 6 + 10\\text{ units} = \\boxed{21\\text{ units}}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the value of $x$ if a cube's volume is $5x$ cubic units and its surface area is $x$ square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the cube's volume is $5x$ cubic units, each side measures $\\sqrt[3]{5x}$ units. The surface area is then $6(\\sqrt[3]{5x})^2$. We are told the surface area is also $x$. We have the equation $6(\\sqrt[3]{5x})^2=x$ Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\\boxed{5400}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the smallest possible area, in square units, of a right triangle with two sides measuring $4$ units and $5$ units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $5>4$, $4$ cannot be the length of the hypotenuse. Thus either $4$ and $5$ are the lengths of the two smaller sides, or $5$ is the hypotenuse, meaning the two smaller sides are $4$ and $3$. In this latter case, the area will be smaller, so the area is $\\frac{(3)(4)}{2} = \\boxed{6}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n For $x > 0$, the area of the triangle with vertices $(0, 0), (x, 0)$ and $(x, 5)$ is 30 square units. What is the value of $x$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
