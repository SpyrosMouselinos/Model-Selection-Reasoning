    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and a point $K$ on $BC$ such that $AK$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$. If $AC = 10,$ $BK = 7$, and $BC = 13,$ then what is the area of $\\triangle ABC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we sketch! [asy]\npair A, B, C, K;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-7, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nK = (0, 0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--K);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$K$\", K, NE);\nlabel(\"10\", C--A, NE);\nlabel(\"7\", B--K, N);\nlabel(\"13\", B--C, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,K,B,10));\n[/asy] We now see that $CK = BC - BK = 6.$ That means $\\triangle AKC$ is a $3:4:5$ right triangle, so $AK = 8.$ At this point, we can see that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AK \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{52}.$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $P$ is inside equilateral $\\triangle ABC$.  Points $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are the feet of the perpendiculars from $P$ to $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CA}$, respectively. Given that $PQ=1$, $PR=2$, and $PS=3$, what is $AB$ in terms of radicals?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the side length of $\\triangle ABC$ be $s$. Then the areas of $\\triangle APB$, $\\triangle BPC$, and $\\triangle CPA$ are, respectively, $s/2$, $s$, and $3s/2$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is the sum of these, which is $3s$.  The area of $\\triangle ABC$ may also be expressed as $(\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$, so $3s = (\\sqrt{3}/4)s^2$. The unique positive solution for $s$ is $\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Equilateral $\\triangle ABC$ has side length $600$. Points $P$ and $Q$ lie outside the plane of $\\triangle ABC$ and are on opposite sides of the plane. Furthermore, $PA=PB=PC$, and $QA=QB=QC$, and the planes of $\\triangle PAB$ and $\\triangle QAB$ form a $120^{\\circ}$ dihedral angle (the angle between the two planes). There is a point $O$ whose distance from each of $A,B,C,P,$ and $Q$ is $d$. Find $d$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The inradius of $\\triangle ABC$ is $100\\sqrt 3$ and the circumradius is $200 \\sqrt 3$. Now, consider the line perpendicular to plane $ABC$ through the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$. Note that $P,Q,O$ must lie on that line to be equidistant from each of the triangle's vertices. Also, note that since $P, Q, O$ are collinear, and $OP=OQ$, we must have $O$ is the midpoint of $PQ$. Now, Let $K$ be the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$, and $L$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$. We must have $\\tan(\\angle KLP+ \\angle QLK)= \\tan(120^{\\circ})$. Setting $KP=x$ and $KQ=y$, assuming WLOG $x>y$, we must have $\\tan(120^{\\circ})=-\\sqrt{3}=\\dfrac{\\dfrac{x+y}{100 \\sqrt{3}}}{\\dfrac{30000-xy}{30000}}$. Therefore, we must have $100(x+y)=xy-30000$. Also, we must have $\\left(\\dfrac{x+y}{2}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\dfrac{x-y}{2}\\right)^{2}+120000$ by the Pythagorean theorem, so we have $xy=120000$, so substituting into the other equation we have $90000=100(x+y)$, or $x+y=900$. Since we want $\\dfrac{x+y}{2}$, the desired answer is $\\boxed{450}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Convex pentagon $ABCDE$ has side lengths $AB=5$, $BC=CD=DE=6$, and $EA=7$. Moreover, the pentagon has an inscribed circle (a circle tangent to each side of the pentagon). Find the area of $ABCDE$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Assume the incircle touches $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, $DE$, $EA$ at $P,Q,R,S,T$ respectively. Then let $PB=x=BQ=RD=SD$, $ET=y=ES=CR=CQ$, $AP=AT=z$. So we have $x+y=6$, $x+z=5$ and $y+z$=7, solve it we have $x=2$, $z=3$, $y=4$. Let the center of the incircle be $I$, by SAS we can proof triangle $BIQ$ is congruent to triangle $DIS$, and triangle $CIR$ is congruent to triangle $SIE$. Then we have $\\angle AED=\\angle BCD$, $\\angle ABC=\\angle CDE$. Extend $CD$, cross ray $AB$ at $M$, ray $AE$ at $N$, then by AAS we have triangle $END$ is congruent to triangle $BMC$. Thus $\\angle M=\\angle N$. Let $EN=MC=a$, then $BM=DN=a+2$. So by law of cosine in triangle $END$ and triangle $ANM$ we can obtain\\[\\frac{2a+8}{2(a+7)}=\\cos N=\\frac{a^2+(a+2)^2-36}{2a(a+2)}\\], solved it gives us $a=8$, which yield triangle $ANM$ to be a triangle with side length 15, 15, 24, draw a height from $A$ to $NM$ divides it into two triangles with side lengths 9, 12, 15, so the area of triangle $ANM$ is 108. Triangle $END$ is a triangle with side lengths 6, 8, 10, so the area of two of them is 48, so the area of pentagon is $108-48=\\boxed{60}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB=13$, $BC=15$ and $CA=17$. Point $D$ is on $\\overline{AB}$, $E$ is on $\\overline{BC}$, and $F$ is on $\\overline{CA}$. Let $AD=p\\cdot AB$, $BE=q\\cdot BC$, and $CF=r\\cdot CA$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are positive and satisfy $p+q+r=2/3$ and $p^2+q^2+r^2=2/5$. The ratio of the area of triangle $DEF$ to the area of triangle $ABC$ can be written in the form $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]  /* -- arbitrary values, I couldn't find nice values for pqr please replace if possible -- */  real p = 0.5, q = 0.1, r = 0.05;   /* -- arbitrary values, I couldn't find nice values for pqr please replace if possible -- */  pointpen = black; pathpen = linewidth(0.7) + black; pair A=(0,0),B=(13,0),C=IP(CR(A,17),CR(B,15)), D=A+p*(B-A), E=B+q*(C-B), F=C+r*(A-C); D(D(MP(\"A\",A))--D(MP(\"B\",B))--D(MP(\"C\",C,N))--cycle); D(D(MP(\"D\",D))--D(MP(\"E\",E,NE))--D(MP(\"F\",F,NW))--cycle); [/asy]\nWe let $[\\ldots]$ denote area; then the desired value is\n$\\frac mn = \\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} = \\frac{[ABC] - [ADF] - [BDE] - [CEF]}{[ABC]}$\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle $\\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin C$, we find that\n$\\frac{[ADF]}{[ABC]} = \\frac{\\frac 12 \\cdot p \\cdot AB \\cdot (1-r) \\cdot AC \\cdot \\sin \\angle CAB}{\\frac 12 \\cdot AB \\cdot AC \\cdot \\sin \\angle CAB} = p(1-r)$\nand similarly that $\\frac{[BDE]}{[ABC]} = q(1-p)$ and $\\frac{[CEF]}{[ABC]} = r(1-q)$. Thus, we wish to find\\begin{align*}\\frac{[DEF]}{[ABC]} &= 1 - \\frac{[ADF]}{[ABC]} - \\frac{[BDE]}{[ABC]} - \\frac{[CEF]}{[ABC]}  \\\\ &= 1 - p(1-r) - q(1-p) - r(1-q)\\\\ &= (pq + qr + rp) - (p + q + r) + 1 \\end{align*}We know that $p + q + r = \\frac 23$, and also that $(p+q+r)^2 = p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + 2(pq + qr + rp) \\Longleftrightarrow pq + qr + rp = \\frac{\\left(\\frac 23\\right)^2 - \\frac 25}{2} = \\frac{1}{45}$. Substituting, the answer is $\\frac 1{45} - \\frac 23 + 1 = \\frac{16}{45}$, and $m+n = \\boxed{61}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 7$, $AC = 15$, and the length of median $AM$ is 10.  Find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Extend $AM$ to $D$ so that $MD = MA$.  Then triangles $AMB$ and $DMC$ are congruent, so triangles $ABC$ and $ACD$ have equal area.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, M;\n\nA = (-7/sqrt(37),42/sqrt(37));\nB = (0,0);\nC = (2*sqrt(37),0);\nM = (B + C)/2;\nD = 2*M - A;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D--C);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$7$\", (A + B)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$15$\", (A + C)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (A + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (D + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$7$\", (C + D)/2, E);\n[/asy]\n\nThe semi-perimeter of triangle $ACD$ is $(7 + 15 + 20)/2 = 21$, so by Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ACD$ is $$\\sqrt{21 (21 - 7)(21 - 15)(21 - 20)} = \\boxed{42}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In $\\triangle ABC$ the ratio $AC:CB$ is $3:4$. The bisector of the exterior angle at $C$ intersects $BA$ extended at $P$ ($A$ is between $P$ and $B$). The ratio $PA:AB$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1:3 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 3:4 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 4:3 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 3:1 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 7:1$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] draw((0,0)--(40,0)--(16,18)--(0,0)); draw((40,0)--(64,72)--(16,18)); draw((40,0)--(160,0)--(64,72),dotted); dot((0,0)); label(\"B\",(0,0),SW); dot((16,18)); label(\"A\",(16,18),NW); dot((40,0)); label(\"C\",(40,0),S); dot((64,72)); label(\"P\",(64,72),N); dot((160,0)); label(\"X\",(160,0),SE);  label(\"$4n$\",(20,0),S); label(\"$3n$\",(33,17)); label(\"$4an-4n$\",(100,0),S); label(\"$3an$\",(112,36),NE); [/asy]Let $AC = 3n$ and $BC = 4n$. Draw $X$, where $X$ is on $BC$ and $AC \\parallel PX$. By AA Similarity, $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle PBX$, so $PX = 3an$, $BX = 4an$, and $CX = 4an - 4n$.\nAlso, let $\\angle ABC = a$ and $\\angle BAC = b$. Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\\circ}$, $\\angle BCA = 180-a-b$. By Exterior Angle Theorem, $\\angle ACX = a+b$, and since $CP$ bisects $\\angle ACX$, $\\angle PCX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$. Because $AC \\parallel PX$, $\\angle BXP = 180 - a - b$. Thus, $\\angle CPX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$, making $\\triangle CPX$ an isosceles triangle.\nBecause $\\triangle CPX$ is isosceles, $PX = CX$, so $4an - 4n = 3an$. That means $a = 4$, so $PB = 4 \\cdot AB$. Thus, $PA = PB - AB = 3 \\cdot AB$, so $PA : AB = \\boxed{3:1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices at $A(5,8)$, $B(3,-2)$, and $C(6,1)$. The point $D$ with coordinates $(m,n)$ is chosen inside the triangle so that the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$ and $BCD$ all have equal areas. What is the value of $10m + n$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, then $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ would all have equal areas (to see this, remember that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into 6 equal areas). There is only one point with this property (if we move around $D$, the area of one of the small triangles will increase and will no longer be $1/3$ of the total area). So $D$ must be the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the centroid are found by averaging the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the vertices, so $(m,n) = \\left( \\frac{5+3+6}{3}, \\frac{8+(-2)+1}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$, and $10m + n = 10 \\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) + \\frac{7}{3} = \\boxed{49}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, medians $AD$ and $CE$ intersect at $P$, $PE=1.5$, $PD=2$, and $DE=2.5$.  What is the area of $AEDC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that $1.5^2 + 2^2 = 2.5^2,$ so $\\triangle PED$ has a right angle at $P.$ (Alternatively, you could note that $(1.5, 2, 2.5)$ is half of the Pythagorean triple $(3,4,5).$) [asy]size(6cm);pair P=(0,0),D=(0,-2),E=(-1.5,0),C=(3,0),A=(0,4),B=extension(A,E,D,C);draw(A--B--C--cycle^^C--E^^A--D);draw(rightanglemark(E,P,D));draw(E--D);dot(\"$A$\",A,N);dot(\"$B$\",B,SW);dot(\"$C$\",C,dir(0));dot(\"$D$\",D,SSE);dot(\"$E$\",E,NW);dot(\"$P$\",P,NE);[/asy] Since the centroid $P$ divides medians $AD$ and $CE$ in the ratio $2 : 1,$ we have $CP = 2 \\cdot EP = 2 \\cdot 1.5 = 3$ and $AP = 2 \\cdot DP = 2 \\cdot 2 = 4.$ Then quadrilateral $AEDC$ consists of four right triangles; we can then compute its area as \\[[AEDC] = \\tfrac12 (4 \\cdot 1.5 + 2 \\cdot 1.5 + 3 \\cdot 2 + 4 \\cdot 3) = \\boxed{13.5}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ is inscribed in triangle $EFG$ such that side $AD$ of the rectangle is on side $EG$ of the triangle, as shown. The triangle's altitude from $F$ to side $EG$ is 7 inches, and $EG = 10 \\text{ inches}$. The length of segment $AB$ is equal to half the length of segment $AD$. What is the area of rectangle $ABCD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nimport math;\nsize(101);\nreal x = 35/12;\ncurrentpen = linewidth(1)+fontsize(10pt);\npair E1 = (0,0), G = (10,0), F = (3,7), A = (3*x/7,0), D = G - (7*x/7,0), B = extension(E1,F,A,A+(0,1)), C = extension(G,F,D,D+(0,1));\ndraw(E1--F--G--cycle); draw(A--B--C--D); label(\"$A$\",A,S); label(\"$B$\",B,NW); label(\"$C$\",C,NE); label(\"$D$\",D,S); label(\"$E$\",E1,W); label(\"$F$\",F,NNW); label(\"$G$\",G,ESE);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Suppose that the altitude from $F$ to $EG$ intersects $EG$ at point $H$.  Then $\\triangle EAB \\sim \\triangle EHF$, and we have that $\\frac{HE}{HF} = \\frac{AE}{AB}$.  Also, $\\triangle GDC \\sim GHF$, and $\\frac{HG}{HF} = \\frac{DG}{DC}$.  Adding these equalities, we find that $\\frac{HE + HG}{HF} = \\frac{AE + DG}{AB}$, since $AB = DC$.  But $HE + HG = EG = 10$, $HF = 7$, and finally $AE + DG = EG - AD = 10 - 2AB$.  Plugging in, we find that $\\frac{10}{7} = \\frac{10-2AB}{AB}$, or $AB = \\frac{35}{12}$.  Thus the area of $ABCD$ is $\\frac{35}{12}\\cdot\\frac{35}{6} =\\boxed{ \\frac{1225}{72}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $P$ is inside equilateral triangle $ABC$ such that the altitudes from $P$ to $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CA}$ have lengths 5, 6, and 7 respectively.
