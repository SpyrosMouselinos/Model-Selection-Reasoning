    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two concentric circles are centered at point P. The sides of a 45 degree angle at P form an arc on the smaller circle that is the same length as an arc on the larger circle formed by the sides of a 36  degree angle at P. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger circle? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be the circumferences of the smaller and larger circle, respectively.  The length of the $45^\\circ$ arc on the smaller circle is $\\left(\\frac{45^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\right)C_1$, and the length of the $36^\\circ$ arc on the larger circle is $\\left(\\frac{36^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\right)C_2$.  Setting these two lengths equal we find \\[\n\\frac{C_1}{C_2}=\\frac{36}{45}=\\frac{4}{5}.\n\\]The ratio of the areas of the two circles is the square of the ratio of their circumferences: \\[\n\\frac{\\pi r_1^2}{\\pi r_2^2}=\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{2\\pi r_1}{2\\pi r_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{C_1}{C_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2=\\boxed{\\frac{16}{25}}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 33 units and 42 units. The third side also has an integral length. What is the least possible number of units in the perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The sum of the smaller two sides must exceed the greatest side, so if $x$ is the missing side then $x+33>42\\implies x>9$.  The smallest integer greater than 9 is 10, so the least perimeter is $10+33+42=\\boxed{85}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If an arc of $45^{\\circ}$ on circle $A$ has the same length as an arc of $30^{\\circ}$ on circle $B$, then what is the ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $C_A= 2\\pi R_A$ be the circumference of circle $A$, let $C_B= 2\\pi R_B$  be the circumference of circle $B$, and let $L$ the common length of the  two arcs. Then $$\n\\frac{45}{360}C_A = L = \\frac{30}{360}C_B.\n$$Therefore $$\n\\frac{C_A}{C_B} = \\frac{2}{3}\\quad\\text{so}\\quad\n\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{2\\pi R_A}{2\\pi R_B} =\\frac{R_A}{R_B}.\n$$Thus, the ratio of the areas is $$\n\\frac{\\text{Area of Circle }(A)}{\\text{Area of Circle }(B)}\n=\\frac{\\pi R_A^2}{\\pi R_B^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_A}{R_B}\\right)^2 =\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}.\n$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The region shown is bounded by the arcs of circles having radius 4 units, having a central angle measure of 60 degrees and intersecting at points of tangency. The area of the region can be expressed in the form $a\\sqrt{b}+c\\pi$ square units, where $\\sqrt{b}$ is a radical in simplest form. What is the value of $a + b + c$?\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw(arc((-2,0),2,0,60));\ndraw(arc((0,3.464),2,-60,-120));\ndraw(arc((2,0),2,120,180));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Consider point $A$ at the center of the diagram. Drawing in lines as shown below divides the region into 3 parts with equal areas. Because the full circle around point $A$ is divided into 3 angles of equal measure, each of these angles is 120 degrees in measure.\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D;\nA=(0,1.155);\nB=(0,0);\nC=(-1,1.732);\nD=(1,1.732);\ndraw(arc((-2,0),2,0,60));\ndraw(arc((0,3.464),2,-60,-120));\ndraw(arc((2,0),2,120,180));\ndot(A);\nlabel(\"A\", A, N);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(A--D);\n[/asy] Now consider a circle of radius 4 inscribed inside a regular hexagon:\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-4.619,0);\nB=(-2.309,4);\nC=(2.309,4);\nD=(4.619,0);\nE=(2.309,-4);\nF=(-2.309,-4);\nM=(A+B)/2;\ndraw(circle(O,4));\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\nlabel(\"A\", A, W);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, SE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, E);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SE);\nlabel(\"F\", F, SW);\nlabel(\"M\", M, NW);\ndraw(A--O);\ndraw(B--O);\ndraw(M--O);\nlabel(\"$4$\", 3M/4, NE);\n[/asy] Now, the pieces of area inside the hexagon but outside the circle are identical to the pieces of area the original region was divided into. There were 3 pieces in the original diagram, but there are 6 in the hexagon picture. Thus, the area of the original region is the half the area inside the hexagon but outside the circle.\n\nBecause $ABO$ is equilateral, $BMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so $BM=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Thus, the side length of the equilateral triangle is $AB=2BM=\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Now we know the base $AB$ and the height $MO$ so we can find the area of triangle $ABO$ to be $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot 4=\\frac{16}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{3}$. The entirety of hexagon $ABCDEF$ can be divided into 6 such triangles, so the area of $ABCDEF$ is $\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 6 = 32\\sqrt{3}$. The area of the circle is $\\pi 4^2=16\\pi$. Thus, the area inside the heagon but outside the circle is $32\\sqrt{3}-16\\pi$. Thus, the area of the original region is $\\frac{32\\sqrt{3}-16\\pi}{2}=16\\sqrt{3}-8\\pi$.\n\nNow we have $a=16$, $b=3$ and $c=-8$. Adding, we get $16+3+(-8)=\\boxed{11}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of an equilateral triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. What is the perimeter of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$. This must equal $s$. Setting the two equal and solving, we get \\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\\\\n4s&=s^2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4 &= s\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4\\sqrt{3}&= 3s \\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} &=s\n\\end{align*} Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is $3s=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}} \\text{units}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The inscribed circle of triangle $ABC$ is tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $P,$ and its radius is $21$. Given that $AP=23$ and $PB=27,$ find the perimeter of the triangle.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] pathpen = black + linewidth(0.65); pointpen = black; pair A=(0,0),B=(50,0),C=IP(circle(A,23+245/2),circle(B,27+245/2)), I=incenter(A,B,C); path P = incircle(A,B,C); D(MP(\"A\",A)--MP(\"B\",B)--MP(\"C\",C,N)--cycle);D(P); D(MP(\"P\",IP(A--B,P))); pair Q=IP(C--A,P),R=IP(B--C,P); D(MP(\"R\",R,NE));D(MP(\"Q\",Q,NW)); MP(\"23\",(A+Q)/2,W);MP(\"27\",(B+R)/2,E); [/asy]\nLet $Q$ be the tangency point on $\\overline{AC}$, and $R$ on $\\overline{BC}$. By the Two Tangent Theorem, $AP = AQ = 23$, $BP = BR = 27$, and $CQ = CR = x$. Using $rs = A$, where $s = \\frac{27 \\cdot 2 + 23 \\cdot 2 + x \\cdot 2}{2} = 50 + x$, we get $(21)(50 + x) = A$. By Heron's formula, $A = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{(50+x)(x)(23)(27)}$. Equating and squaring both sides,\n\\begin{eqnarray*}  [21(50+x)]^2 &=& (50+x)(x)(621)\\\\ 441(50+x) &=& 621x\\\\ 180x = 441 \\cdot 50 &\\Longrightarrow & x = \\frac{245}{2}   \\end{eqnarray*}\nWe want the perimeter, which is $2s = 2\\left(50 + \\frac{245}{2}\\right) = \\boxed{345}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The number of inches in the perimeter of an equilateral triangle equals the number of square inches in the area of its circumscribed circle. What is the radius, in inches, of the circle? Express your answer in terms of pi and in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the triangle have vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, let $O$ be the center of the circle, and let $D$ be the midpoint of $\n\\overline{BC}$. Triangle $COD$ is a $30 - 60 - 90$ degree triangle. If $r$ is the radius of the circle, then the sides of $\\triangle COD$ are $r$, $\\frac{r}{2}$, and $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $6\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\displaystyle\\right)=3r\\sqrt{3}$, and the area of the circle is $\\pi r^{2}$. Thus $3r\\sqrt{3} = \\pi r^{2}$, and $r =\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{\\pi}}$.\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,D,O;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(0,1);\nB=(0.87,-0.5);\nC=(-0.87,-0.5);\nD=(0,-0.5);\ndraw(Circle(O,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(C--O--D--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$\\frac{r}{2}$\",(0,-0.25),E);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}$\",(-0.43,-0.5),S);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-0.43,-0.25),NW);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,N);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles triangle has side lengths 8 cm, 8 cm and 10 cm.  The longest side of a similar triangle is 25 cm. What is the perimeter of the larger triangle, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the length of the longest sides of the small triangle to the large triangle is $10/25 = 2/5$, which must hold constant for all sides of the two triangles since they are similar.  Thus the perimeters of the two triangles are also in the ratio of $2/5$.  The small triangle has perimeter $8+8+10=26$, so the large triangle has perimeter $\\frac{5}{2}\\cdot 26 = \\boxed{65}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right triangle has a side length of 21 inches and a hypotenuse of 29 inches. A second triangle is similar to the first and has a hypotenuse of 87 inches. What is the length of the shortest side of the second triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we calculate that the other leg of the original right triangle must be $$\\sqrt{29^2 - 21^2} = \\sqrt{841 - 441} = \\sqrt{400} = 20$$ inches. Since 87 is 3 times 29, the length of the shortest side of the second triangle must be $3 \\times 20 = \\boxed{60\\text{ inches}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a circle of radius $42$, two chords of length $78$ intersect at a point whose distance from the center is $18$. The two chords divide the interior of the circle into four regions. Two of these regions are bordered by segments of unequal lengths, and the area of either of them can be expressed uniquely in the form $m\\pi-n\\sqrt{d},$ where $m, n,$ and $d$ are positive integers and $d$ is not divisible by the square of any prime number. Find $m+n+d.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the center of the circle be $O$, and the two chords be $\\overline{AB}, \\overline{CD}$ and intersecting at $E$, such that $AE = CE < BE = DE$. Let $F$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$. Then $\\overline{OF} \\perp \\overline{AB}$.\n[asy] size(200); pathpen = black + linewidth(0.7); pen d = dashed+linewidth(0.7); pair O = (0,0), E=(0,18), B=E+48*expi(11*pi/6), D=E+48*expi(7*pi/6), A=E+30*expi(5*pi/6), C=E+30*expi(pi/6), F=foot(O,B,A); D(CR(D(MP(\"O\",O)),42)); D(MP(\"A\",A,NW)--MP(\"B\",B,SE)); D(MP(\"C\",C,NE)--MP(\"D\",D,SW)); D(MP(\"E\",E,N)); D(C--B--O--E,d);D(O--D(MP(\"F\",F,NE)),d); MP(\"39\",(B+F)/2,NE);MP(\"30\",(C+E)/2,NW);MP(\"42\",(B+O)/2); [/asy]\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, $OF = \\sqrt{OB^2 - BF^2} = \\sqrt{42^2 - 39^2} = 9\\sqrt{3}$, and $EF = \\sqrt{OE^2 - OF^2} = 9$. Then $OEF$ is a $30-60-90$ right triangle, so $\\angle OEB = \\angle OED = 60^{\\circ}$. Thus $\\angle BEC = 60^{\\circ}$, and by the Law of Cosines,\n$BC^2 = BE^2 + CE^2 - 2 \\cdot BE \\cdot CE \\cos 60^{\\circ} = 42^2.$\nIt follows that $\\triangle BCO$ is an equilateral triangle, so $\\angle BOC = 60^{\\circ}$. The desired area can be broken up into two regions, $\\triangle BCE$ and the region bounded by $\\overline{BC}$ and minor arc $\\stackrel{\\frown}{BC}$. The former can be found by Heron's formula to be $[BCE] = \\sqrt{60(60-48)(60-42)(60-30)} = 360\\sqrt{3}$. The latter is the difference between the area of sector $BOC$ and the equilateral $\\triangle BOC$, or $\\frac{1}{6}\\pi (42)^2 - \\frac{42^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = 294\\pi - 441\\sqrt{3}$.\nThus, the desired area is $360\\sqrt{3} + 294\\pi - 441\\sqrt{3} = 294\\pi - 81\\sqrt{3}$, and $m+n+d = \\boxed{378}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The perimeter of a sector of a circle is the sum of the two sides formed by the radii and the length of the included arc. A sector of a particular circle has a perimeter of 28 cm and an area of 49 sq cm. What is the length of the arc of this sector?\n\nAnswer:\n",
