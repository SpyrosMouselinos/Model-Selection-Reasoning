    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many different isosceles triangles have integer side lengths and perimeter 23?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because the perimeter of such a triangle is 23, and the sum of the two equal side lengths is even, the length of the base is odd. Also, the length of the base is less than the sum of the other two side lengths, so it is less than half of 23. Thus the $\\boxed{6}$ possible triangles have side lengths 1, 11, 11; 3, 10, 10; 5, 9, 9; 7, 8, 8; 9, 7, 7 and 11, 6, 6.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n For some positive integers $p$, there is a quadrilateral $ABCD$ with positive integer side lengths, perimeter $p$, right angles at $B$ and $C$, $AB=2$, and $CD=AD$. How many different values of $p<2015$ are possible?\n$\\textbf{(A) }30\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }31\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }61\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }62\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }63$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $BC = x$ and $CD = AD = y$ be positive integers. Drop a perpendicular from $A$ to $CD$ to show that, using the Pythagorean Theorem, that\\[x^2 + (y - 2)^2 = y^2.\\]Simplifying yields $x^2 - 4y + 4 = 0$, so $x^2 = 4(y - 1)$. Thus, $y$ is one more than a perfect square.\nThe perimeter $p = 2 + x + 2y = 2y + 2\\sqrt{y - 1} + 2$ must be less than 2015. Simple calculations demonstrate that $y = 31^2 + 1 = 962$ is valid, but $y = 32^2 + 1 = 1025$ is not. On the lower side, $y = 1$ does not work (because $x > 0$), but $y = 1^2 + 1$ does work. Hence, there are 31 valid $y$ (all $y$ such that $y = n^2 + 1$ for $1 \\le n \\le 31$), and so our answer is $\\boxed{31}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Given a triangle, its midpoint triangle is obtained by joining the midpoints of its sides. A sequence of polyhedra $P_{i}$ is defined recursively as follows: $P_{0}$ is a regular tetrahedron whose volume is 1. To obtain $P_{i + 1}$, replace the midpoint triangle of every face of $P_{i}$ by an outward-pointing regular tetrahedron that has the midpoint triangle as a face. The volume of $P_{3}$ is $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n On the first construction, $P_1$, four new tetrahedra will be constructed with side lengths $\\frac 12$ of the original one. Since the ratio of the volume of similar polygons is the cube of the ratio of their corresponding lengths, it follows that each of these new tetrahedra will have volume $\\left(\\frac 12\\right)^3 = \\frac 18$. The total volume added here is then $\\Delta P_1 = 4 \\cdot \\frac 18 = \\frac 12$.\nWe now note that for each midpoint triangle we construct in step $P_{i}$, there are now $6$ places to construct new midpoint triangles for step $P_{i+1}$. The outward tetrahedron for the midpoint triangle provides $3$ of the faces, while the three equilateral triangles surrounding the midpoint triangle provide the other $3$. This is because if you read this question carefully, it asks to add new tetrahedra to each face of $P_{i}$ which also includes the ones that were left over when we did the previous addition of tetrahedra. However, the volume of the tetrahedra being constructed decrease by a factor of $\\frac 18$. Thus we have the recursion $\\Delta P_{i+1} = \\frac{6}{8} \\Delta P_i$, and so $\\Delta P_i = \\frac 12 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{i-1} P_1$.\nThe volume of $P_3 = P_0 + \\Delta P_1 + \\Delta P_2 + \\Delta P_3 = 1 + \\frac 12 + \\frac 38 + \\frac 9{32} = \\frac{69}{32}$, and $m+n=\\boxed{101}$. Note that the summation was in fact a geometric series.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many non-congruent triangles with only integer side lengths have a perimeter of 15 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In a triangle, the lengths of any two sides must add up to a value larger than the third length's side.  This is known as the Triangle Inequality.  Keeping this in mind, we list out cases based on the length of the shortest side.\n\nCase 1:  shortest side has length $1$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $7$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{1,7,7\\}$.\n\nCase 2:  shortest side has length $2$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $6$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{2,6,7\\}$.\n\nCase 3:  shortest side has length $3$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $6$ and $6$ or $5$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{3,6,6\\}$ and $\\{3,5,7\\}$.\n\nCase 4:  shortest side has length $4$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $5$ and $6$ or $4$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{4,5,6\\}$ and $\\{4,4,7\\}$.\n\nCase 5:  shortest side has length $5$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $5$ and $5$.  This leads to the set $\\{5,5,5\\}$.\n\nHence there are $\\boxed{7}$ sets of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of $15$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n It is desired to construct a right triangle in the coordinate plane so that its legs are parallel to the $x$ and $y$ axes and so that the medians to the midpoints of the legs lie on the lines $y = 3x + 1$ and $y = mx + 2$. The number of different constants $m$ for which such a triangle exists is\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 1\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 2\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 3\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{more than 3}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In any right triangle with legs parallel to the axes, one median to the midpoint of a leg has slope $4$ times that of the other. This can easily be shown with coordinates: any triangle of this sort may be labelled with right angle at $P(a,b)$, other vertices $Q(a,b+2c)$ and $R(a-2d,b)$, and thus midpoints $(a,b+c)$ and $(a-d,b)$, so that the slopes are $\\frac{c}{2d}$ and $\\frac{2c}{d} = 4(\\frac{c}{2d})$, thus showing that one is $4$ times the other as required.\nThus in our problem, $m$ is either $3 \\times 4 = 12$ or $3 \\div 4 = \\frac{3}{4}$. In fact, both are possible, and each for infinitely many triangles. We shall show this for $m=12$, and the argument is analogous for $m=\\frac{3}{4}$. Take any right triangle with legs parallel to the axes and a hypotenuse with slope $12 \\div 2 = 6$, e.g. the triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,6)$. Then quick calculations show that the medians to the legs have slopes $12$ and $3$. Now translate the triangle (without rotating it) so that its medians intersect at the point where the lines $y=12x+2$ and $y=3x+1$ intersect. This forces the medians to lie on these lines (since their slopes are determined, and now we force them to go through a particular point; a slope and a point uniquely determine a line). Finally, for any central dilation of this triangle (a larger or smaller triangle with the same centroid and sides parallel to this one's sides), the medians will still lie on these lines, showing the \"infinitely many\" part of the result.\nHence, to sum up, $m$ can in fact be both $12$ or $\\frac{3}{4}$, which is exactly $\\boxed{2}$ values.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ with right angle at $C$, $\\angle BAC < 45^\\circ$ and $AB = 4$. Point $P$ on $\\overline{AB}$ is chosen such that $\\angle APC = 2\\angle ACP$ and $CP = 1$. The ratio $\\frac{AP}{BP}$ can be represented in the form $p + q\\sqrt{r}$, where $p$, $q$, $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $p+q+r$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $O$ be the circumcenter of $ABC$ and let the intersection of $CP$ with the circumcircle be $D$. It now follows that $\\angle{DOA} = 2\\angle ACP = \\angle{APC} = \\angle{DPB}$. Hence $ODP$ is isosceles and $OD = DP = 2$.\nDenote $E$ the projection of $O$ onto $CD$. Now $CD = CP + DP = 3$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OE = \\sqrt {2^2 - \\frac {3^2}{2^2}} = \\sqrt {\\frac {7}{4}}$. Now note that $EP = \\frac {1}{2}$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OP = \\sqrt {\\frac {7}{4} + \\frac {1^2}{2^2}} = \\sqrt {2}$. Hence it now follows that,\n\\[\\frac {AP}{BP} = \\frac {AO + OP}{BO - OP} = \\frac {2 + \\sqrt {2}}{2 - \\sqrt {2}} = 3 + 2\\sqrt {2}\\]\nThis gives that the answer is $\\boxed{7}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A scalene triangle has side lengths which are prime numbers and the  length of its perimeter is also prime. What is its smallest possible  perimeter?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The first few prime numbers are: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,\\ldots$.  Since the triangle is scalene, all the sides are different primes.\n\nIf one side is 2, then the other two sides must be odd.  Then the perimeter of the triangle would be even.  But the perimeter must also be greater than 2, so it cannot be prime.  This means that none of the sides can be 2.\n\nNow, suppose one side is 3.  Let the other two sides be $p$ and $q,$ where $p < q.$  Since all the sides are different,\n\\[3 < p < q.\\]Also, by the Triangle Inequality, $p + 3 > q,$ so\n\\[p > q - 3.\\]Since $p < q,$ the only possible values of $p$ are $q - 2$ and $q - 1.$\n\nSince $p$ is a prime greater than 3, $p$ is odd.  If $p = q - 1,$ then $q = p + 1$ is even, which means $q$ is not prime.  Therefore, $p = q - 2,$ or\n\\[q = p + 2.\\]As a number, $p$ must be of the form $3k,$ $3k + 1,$ or $3k + 2.$  Since $p$ is prime, $p$ cannot be of the form $3k.$  If $p = 3k + 1,$ then $q = p + 2 = 3k + 3 = 3(k + 1),$ which is not prime.  Therefore, $p = 3k + 2.$  Then $q = p + 2 = 3k + 4,$ and the perimeter of the triangle is\n\\[p + q + 3 = (3k + 2) + (3k + 4) + 3 = 6k + 9 = 3(2k + 3).\\]Since this is divisible by 3, the perimeter cannot be prime.  This tells us that none of the sides can be equal to 3 either.\n\nNote that $5 + 7 + 11 = 23$ is prime, so the smallest possible perimeter is $\\boxed{23}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the smallest possible perimeter, in units, of a triangle whose side-length measures are consecutive integer values?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The smallest such triangle has lengths 1, 2, and 3. However, this triangle doesn't work since the sum of any two side lengths must be greater than the third side length (by the Triangle Inequality). The next smallest triangle has lengths 2, 3, and 4, which works. Thus, the smallest possible perimeter is $2+3+4=\\boxed{9}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Consider the set of all triangles $OPQ$ where $O$ is the origin and $P$ and $Q$ are distinct points in the plane with nonnegative integer coordinates $(x,y)$ such that $41x + y = 2009$. Find the number of such distinct triangles whose area is a positive integer.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the two points $P$ and $Q$ be defined with coordinates; $P=(x_1,y_1)$ and $Q=(x_2,y_2)$\nWe can calculate the area of the parallelogram with the determinant of the matrix of the coordinates of the two points(shoelace theorem).\n$\\det \\left(\\begin{array}{c} P \\\\ Q\\end{array}\\right)=\\det \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}x_1 &y_1\\\\x_2&y_2\\end{array}\\right).$\nSince the triangle has half the area of the parallelogram, we just need the determinant to be even.\nThe determinant is\n\\[(x_1)(y_2)-(x_2)(y_1)=(x_1)(2009-41(x_2))-(x_2)(2009-41(x_1))=2009(x_1)-41(x_1)(x_2)-2009(x_2)+41(x_1)(x_2)=2009((x_1)-(x_2))\\]\nSince $2009$ is not even, $((x_1)-(x_2))$ must be even, thus the two $x$'s must be of the same parity. Also note that the maximum value for $x$ is $49$ and the minimum is $0$. There are $25$ even and $25$ odd numbers available for use as coordinates and thus there are $(_{25}C_2)+(_{25}C_2)=\\boxed{600}$ such triangles.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n For how many positive integers $p$ does there exist a triangle with sides of length $3p-1,$ $3p,$ and $p^2 + 1?$\n\nAnswer:\n",
