    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If an arc of $45^{\\circ}$ on circle $A$ has the same length as an arc of $30^{\\circ}$ on circle $B$, then what is the ratio of the area of circle $A$ to the area of circle $B$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $C_A= 2\\pi R_A$ be the circumference of circle $A$, let $C_B= 2\\pi R_B$  be the circumference of circle $B$, and let $L$ the common length of the  two arcs. Then $$\n\\frac{45}{360}C_A = L = \\frac{30}{360}C_B.\n$$Therefore $$\n\\frac{C_A}{C_B} = \\frac{2}{3}\\quad\\text{so}\\quad\n\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{2\\pi R_A}{2\\pi R_B} =\\frac{R_A}{R_B}.\n$$Thus, the ratio of the areas is $$\n\\frac{\\text{Area of Circle }(A)}{\\text{Area of Circle }(B)}\n=\\frac{\\pi R_A^2}{\\pi R_B^2} = \\left(\\frac{R_A}{R_B}\\right)^2 =\\boxed{\\frac{4}{9}}.\n$$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two concentric circles are centered at point P. The sides of a 45 degree angle at P form an arc on the smaller circle that is the same length as an arc on the larger circle formed by the sides of a 36  degree angle at P. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger circle? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be the circumferences of the smaller and larger circle, respectively.  The length of the $45^\\circ$ arc on the smaller circle is $\\left(\\frac{45^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\right)C_1$, and the length of the $36^\\circ$ arc on the larger circle is $\\left(\\frac{36^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\right)C_2$.  Setting these two lengths equal we find \\[\n\\frac{C_1}{C_2}=\\frac{36}{45}=\\frac{4}{5}.\n\\]The ratio of the areas of the two circles is the square of the ratio of their circumferences: \\[\n\\frac{\\pi r_1^2}{\\pi r_2^2}=\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{2\\pi r_1}{2\\pi r_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{C_1}{C_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2=\\boxed{\\frac{16}{25}}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle ABC$ be a right triangle such that $B$ is a right angle. A circle with diameter of $BC$ meets side $AC$ at $D.$ If the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $150$ and $AC = 25,$ then what is $BD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We might try sketching a diagram: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO, pD;\npA = (-15, 0);\npB = (0, 0);\npC = (0, 20);\npO = (0, 10);\npD = (-9.6, 7.2);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pD--pB);\ndraw(circle(pO, 10));\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, S);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", pD, W);\n[/asy] Since $BC$ is a diameter of the circle, that makes $\\angle BDC$ a right angle. That means that $BD$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC.$ Then, we use the area formula to find $150 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AC \\cdot BD,$ where $AC = 25.$ Solving, we have $BD = \\boxed{12}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $A,$ $B,$ and $C$ be points on a circle of radius $18.$ If $\\angle ACB = 70^\\circ,$ what is the circumference of the minor arc ${AB}$? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A diagram can help us get on the right track.\n\n[asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pO;\npO = (0, 0);\npA = pO + dir(-40);\npB = pO + dir(100);\npC = pO + dir(180);\ndraw(pA--pC--pB);\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SE);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, N);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, W);\ndraw(circle(pO, 1));\n[/asy]\n\nFirst of all, the circumference of the entire circle is $36\\pi.$ Since $\\angle C = 70^\\circ,$ we can see that the minor arc ${AB}$ has measure of twice that, or $140^\\circ.$ Therefore, we can find its circumference by finding $36\\pi \\cdot \\frac{140^\\circ}{360^\\circ} = \\boxed{14\\pi}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the figure with circle $Q$, angle $KAT$ measures 42 degrees. What is the measure of minor arc $AK$ in degrees? [asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\ndraw(unitcircle);\ndraw(dir(84)--(-1,0)--(1,0));\ndot(\"$A$\",(-1,0),W); dot(\"$K$\",dir(84),NNE); dot(\"$T$\",(1,0),E); dot(\"$Q$\",(0,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $\\angle A$ is inscribed in arc $KT$, the measure of arc $KT$ is $2\\angle A = 84^\\circ$.  Since arc $AKT$ is a semicircle, arc $KA$ has measure $180 - 84 = \\boxed{96}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The region shown is bounded by the arcs of circles having radius 4 units, having a central angle measure of 60 degrees and intersecting at points of tangency. The area of the region can be expressed in the form $a\\sqrt{b}+c\\pi$ square units, where $\\sqrt{b}$ is a radical in simplest form. What is the value of $a + b + c$?\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw(arc((-2,0),2,0,60));\ndraw(arc((0,3.464),2,-60,-120));\ndraw(arc((2,0),2,120,180));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Consider point $A$ at the center of the diagram. Drawing in lines as shown below divides the region into 3 parts with equal areas. Because the full circle around point $A$ is divided into 3 angles of equal measure, each of these angles is 120 degrees in measure.\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D;\nA=(0,1.155);\nB=(0,0);\nC=(-1,1.732);\nD=(1,1.732);\ndraw(arc((-2,0),2,0,60));\ndraw(arc((0,3.464),2,-60,-120));\ndraw(arc((2,0),2,120,180));\ndot(A);\nlabel(\"A\", A, N);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(A--D);\n[/asy] Now consider a circle of radius 4 inscribed inside a regular hexagon:\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-4.619,0);\nB=(-2.309,4);\nC=(2.309,4);\nD=(4.619,0);\nE=(2.309,-4);\nF=(-2.309,-4);\nM=(A+B)/2;\ndraw(circle(O,4));\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\nlabel(\"A\", A, W);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, SE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, E);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SE);\nlabel(\"F\", F, SW);\nlabel(\"M\", M, NW);\ndraw(A--O);\ndraw(B--O);\ndraw(M--O);\nlabel(\"$4$\", 3M/4, NE);\n[/asy] Now, the pieces of area inside the hexagon but outside the circle are identical to the pieces of area the original region was divided into. There were 3 pieces in the original diagram, but there are 6 in the hexagon picture. Thus, the area of the original region is the half the area inside the hexagon but outside the circle.\n\nBecause $ABO$ is equilateral, $BMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so $BM=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Thus, the side length of the equilateral triangle is $AB=2BM=\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Now we know the base $AB$ and the height $MO$ so we can find the area of triangle $ABO$ to be $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot 4=\\frac{16}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{3}$. The entirety of hexagon $ABCDEF$ can be divided into 6 such triangles, so the area of $ABCDEF$ is $\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 6 = 32\\sqrt{3}$. The area of the circle is $\\pi 4^2=16\\pi$. Thus, the area inside the heagon but outside the circle is $32\\sqrt{3}-16\\pi$. Thus, the area of the original region is $\\frac{32\\sqrt{3}-16\\pi}{2}=16\\sqrt{3}-8\\pi$.\n\nNow we have $a=16$, $b=3$ and $c=-8$. Adding, we get $16+3+(-8)=\\boxed{11}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the area of rhombus $ABCD$ given that the radii of the circles circumscribed around triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$ are $12.5$ and $25$, respectively.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The diagonals of the rhombus perpendicularly bisect each other. Call half of diagonal BD $a$ and half of diagonal AC $b$. The length of the four sides of the rhombus is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.\nThe area of any triangle can be expressed as $\\frac{a\\cdot b\\cdot c}{4R}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides and $R$ is the circumradius. Thus, the area of $\\triangle ABD$ is $ab=2a(a^2+b^2)/(4\\cdot12.5)$. Also, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $ab=2b(a^2+b^2)/(4\\cdot25)$. Setting these two expressions equal to each other and simplifying gives $b=2a$. Substitution yields $a=10$ and $b=20$, so the area of the rhombus is $20\\cdot40/2=\\boxed{400}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangle measures 6 meters by 10 meters. Drawn on each side of the rectangle is a semicircle that has the endpoints of its diameter on the vertices of the rectangle. What percent larger is the area of the large semicircles than the area of the small semicircles? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two large semicircles together make a circle of radius 5, which has area $25\\pi$.  The two small circles together make a circle with radius 3, which has area $9\\pi$.  Therefore, the ratio of the large semicircles' area to the small semicircles' area is $\\frac{25\\pi}{9\\pi} = \\frac{25}{9} \\approx 2.78$.    Since the large semicircles have area 2.78 times the small semicircles, the large semicircles' area is $278\\%$ of the small semicircles' area, which is an increase of $278\\% - 100\\% = \\boxed{178\\%}$ over the small semicircles' area.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle with radius 4 cm is tangent to three sides of a rectangle, as shown. The area of the rectangle is twice the area of the circle. What is the length of the longer side of the rectangle, in centimeters? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph;\ndraw((0,0)--(30,0)--(30,20)--(0,20)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((10,10),10));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If the circle has radius 4, its area is $16\\pi$. Thus, the area of the rectangle is $32\\pi$.\n\nThe length of the shorter side of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the circle, so it is 8 centimeters long. This means that the length of the other side is $32\\pi/8 = \\boxed{4\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Segment $AB$ has midpoint $C$, and segment $BC$ has midpoint $D$. Semi-circles are constructed with diameters $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ to form the entire region shown. Segment $CP$ splits the region into two sections of equal area. What is the degree measure of angle $ACP$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--10dir(180),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--10dir(67.5),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--10dir(0),dashed);\n\ndraw(10dir(180)..10dir(90)..10dir(0),linewidth(2));\n\ndraw((5,0)+5dir(180)..(5,0)+5dir(-90)..(5,0)+5dir(0),linewidth(2));\n\ndot((0,0));\ndot((5,0));\n\nlabel(\"A\",10dir(180),W);\nlabel(\"B\",10dir(0),E);\nlabel(\"C\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"D\",5dir(0),NE);\nlabel(\"P\",10dir(67.5),NE);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The semi-circle with diameter BC has radius $\\frac{1}{2}$ that of the semi-circle with diameter AB, and thus, has $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the area.  (Area of a circle $= \\pi \\times r^2$ - thus, if $r$ is half as large, that will be squared in the process).  Therefore, the sum of their areas represents $\\frac{5}{8}$ of a circle with diameter AB, and since the line CP splits this area exactly in half, that area would be $\\frac{5}{16}$ of a circle with diameter AB.  Therefore, the degree measure of that sector is $360 \\times \\frac{5}{16} = \\boxed{112.5}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If the degree measure of an arc of a circle is increased by $20\\%$ and the radius of the circle is increased by $25\\%$, by what percent does the length of the arc increase?\n\nAnswer:\n",
