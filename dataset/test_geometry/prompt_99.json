    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An octagon is inscribed in a square so that the vertices of the octagon trisect the sides of the square. The perimeter of the square is 108 centimeters. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the octagon?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each side of the square has length $27$. Each trisected segment therefore has length $9$. We can form the octagon by taking away four triangles, each of which has area $\\frac{(9)(9)}{2}$, for a total of $(2)(9)(9) = 162$. The total area of the square is $27^2=729$, so the area of the octagon is $729-162=\\boxed{567}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The vertices of a square are the centers of four circles as shown below. Given each side of the square is 6cm and the radius of each circle is $2\\sqrt{3}$cm, find the area in square centimeters of the shaded region. [asy]\nfill( (-1,-1)-- (1,-1) -- (1,1) -- (-1,1)--cycle, gray);\nfill( Circle((1,1), 1.2), white);\nfill( Circle((-1,-1), 1.2), white);\nfill( Circle((1,-1),1.2), white);\nfill( Circle((-1,1), 1.2), white);\ndraw( Arc((1,1),1.2 ,180,270));\ndraw( Arc((1,-1),1.2,90,180));\ndraw( Arc((-1,-1),1.2,0,90));\ndraw( Arc((-1,1),1.2,0,-90));\ndraw( (-1,-1)-- (1,-1) -- (1,1) -- (-1,1)--cycle,linewidth(.8));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nfill( (-1,-1)-- (1,-1) -- (1,1) -- (-1,1)--cycle, gray);\nfill( Circle((1,1), 1.2), white);\nfill( Circle((-1,-1), 1.2), white);\nfill( Circle((1,-1),1.2), white);\nfill( Circle((-1,1), 1.2), white);\ndraw( Arc((1,1),1.2 ,180,270));\ndraw( Arc((1,-1),1.2,90,180));\ndraw( Arc((-1,-1),1.2,0,90));\ndraw( Arc((-1,1),1.2,0,-90));\ndraw( (-1,-1)-- (1,-1) -- (1,1) -- (-1,1)--cycle,linewidth(.8));\ndraw( (-1,1) -- (0,.33), red+linewidth(.8));\ndraw( (-1,1) -- (-.33,0), red+linewidth(.8));\ndraw( (-.33,0) -- (-1,0), blue+linewidth(.8));\ndraw( (0,.33) -- (0,1), blue+linewidth(.8));\n\n[/asy] Look at the right triangle that consists of a blue side, a red side, and a grey side. The grey side has length $3$ (half the length of the square side length). Since the red side has length $2\\sqrt{3}$, by Pythagoras the blue side has length $\\sqrt{3}$; thus, the right triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle, with area $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(3)(\\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nThe two red radii slice out a sector of 30 degrees, with area $\\left(\\frac{30^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\right)(2\\sqrt{3})^2 \\pi = \\pi$.\n\nThe square consists of 8 right triangles and 4 sectors and one grey shaded area. Thus, the grey shaded area has area \\[6^2 - 8\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) - 4\\pi = \\boxed{36 - 12\\sqrt{3} - 4\\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The region shown is bounded by the arcs of circles having radius 4 units, having a central angle measure of 60 degrees and intersecting at points of tangency. The area of the region can be expressed in the form $a\\sqrt{b}+c\\pi$ square units, where $\\sqrt{b}$ is a radical in simplest form. What is the value of $a + b + c$?\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw(arc((-2,0),2,0,60));\ndraw(arc((0,3.464),2,-60,-120));\ndraw(arc((2,0),2,120,180));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Consider point $A$ at the center of the diagram. Drawing in lines as shown below divides the region into 3 parts with equal areas. Because the full circle around point $A$ is divided into 3 angles of equal measure, each of these angles is 120 degrees in measure.\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D;\nA=(0,1.155);\nB=(0,0);\nC=(-1,1.732);\nD=(1,1.732);\ndraw(arc((-2,0),2,0,60));\ndraw(arc((0,3.464),2,-60,-120));\ndraw(arc((2,0),2,120,180));\ndot(A);\nlabel(\"A\", A, N);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(A--D);\n[/asy] Now consider a circle of radius 4 inscribed inside a regular hexagon:\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-4.619,0);\nB=(-2.309,4);\nC=(2.309,4);\nD=(4.619,0);\nE=(2.309,-4);\nF=(-2.309,-4);\nM=(A+B)/2;\ndraw(circle(O,4));\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\nlabel(\"A\", A, W);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, SE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, E);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SE);\nlabel(\"F\", F, SW);\nlabel(\"M\", M, NW);\ndraw(A--O);\ndraw(B--O);\ndraw(M--O);\nlabel(\"$4$\", 3M/4, NE);\n[/asy] Now, the pieces of area inside the hexagon but outside the circle are identical to the pieces of area the original region was divided into. There were 3 pieces in the original diagram, but there are 6 in the hexagon picture. Thus, the area of the original region is the half the area inside the hexagon but outside the circle.\n\nBecause $ABO$ is equilateral, $BMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so $BM=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Thus, the side length of the equilateral triangle is $AB=2BM=\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Now we know the base $AB$ and the height $MO$ so we can find the area of triangle $ABO$ to be $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot 4=\\frac{16}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{3}$. The entirety of hexagon $ABCDEF$ can be divided into 6 such triangles, so the area of $ABCDEF$ is $\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 6 = 32\\sqrt{3}$. The area of the circle is $\\pi 4^2=16\\pi$. Thus, the area inside the heagon but outside the circle is $32\\sqrt{3}-16\\pi$. Thus, the area of the original region is $\\frac{32\\sqrt{3}-16\\pi}{2}=16\\sqrt{3}-8\\pi$.\n\nNow we have $a=16$, $b=3$ and $c=-8$. Adding, we get $16+3+(-8)=\\boxed{11}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular hexagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 2 units. In square units, what is the area of the hexagon? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect opposite pairs of vertices of the regular hexagon with line segments as shown.  Since each angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees, the six triangles produced are equilateral.  The diameter of the circle circumscribed around the hexagon is equal to twice the side length of each of the triangles.  Therefore, each triangle has side length 2 units.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ units is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$ square units.  (To show this, divide the equilateral triangle into two smaller 30-60-90 triangles.)  Substituting $s=2$, we find that the area of each triangle is $\\sqrt{3}$ square units.  Therefore, area of the hexagon is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(3.5cm);\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\n\nfor(i=0;i<=5;i=i+1)\n\n{\n\ndot((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\ndraw((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6))--(cos(2*pi*(i+1)/6),sin(2*pi*(i+1)/6)));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\n}\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A certain circle's area is $x$ square units, and its circumference is $y$ units. The value of $x + y$ is $80\\pi$. What is the radius of the circle, in units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $r$ is the radius of the circle, we know that $x = \\pi r^2$ and $y = 2\\pi r$. Thus, we have \\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 80\\pi\\\\\n\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r &= 80\\pi\\\\\nr(r + 2) &= 80.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe want to find two integers whose product is 80, such that one integer is two more than the other. We note that 80 can be factored as $8\\cdot 10$. Therefore, $r = \\boxed{8}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is inscribed  in a square, then a square is inscribed  in this circle, and finally, a circle is inscribed  in this square. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger square?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the radius of the smaller circle be $r$. Then the side length of the smaller square is $2r$. The radius of the larger circle is half the length of the diagonal of the smaller square, so it is $\\sqrt{2}r$. Hence the larger square has sides of length $2\\sqrt{2}r$. The ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger square is therefore \\[\n\\frac{\\pi r^2}{\\left(2\\sqrt{2}r\\right)^2} =\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{8}}.\n\\]\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),14.1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,14.1)--(14.1,0)--(0,-14.1)--(-14.1,0)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-14.1,14.1)--(14.1,14.1)--(14.1,-14.1)--(-14.1,-14.1)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(-14.1,0),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-7.1,7.1)--(0,0),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{2}r$\",(-6,0),S);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-3.5,3.5),NE);\nlabel(\"$2r$\",(-7.1,7.1),W);\nlabel(\"$2\\sqrt{2}r$\",(0,14.1),N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The triangle shown is an equilateral triangle with side length 12 cm. A side of the triangle is the diameter of the circle. If the sum of the areas of the two small shaded regions in square centimeters in simplest radical form is $a\\pi - b\\sqrt{c}$, what is $a+b+c$? [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(2inch);\npair A = dir(60);\npair B = dir(240);\npair C = dir(0);\npair D = dir(300);\npair E = extension(A, C, B, D);\ndraw(A--B); draw(A--E); draw(B--E);\ndraw(Circle( (0,0), 1));\nfill(Arc((0,0), C, A)--cycle, gray);\nfill(Arc((0,0), B, D)--cycle, gray);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(2inch);\npair A = dir(60);\npair B = dir(240);\npair C = dir(0);\npair D = dir(300);\npair E = extension(A, C, B, D);\nfill(Arc((0,0), C, A)--cycle, gray);\nfill(Arc((0,0), B, D)--cycle, gray);\ndraw(A--B); draw(A--E); draw(B--E);\ndraw(Circle( (0,0), 1));\ndraw((0,0)--C);\ndraw((0,0)--D);\n\ndot(A);dot(B);dot(C);dot(D);dot(E);dot((0,0));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",E,SE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),NW);\n[/asy]\nFirst, observe that the radius of the circle is $12/2=6$ units. Also, $\\angle AEB$ cuts off the two arcs $\\widehat{AB}$ and $\\widehat{CD}$, so $m\\angle AEB=(m\\,\\widehat{AB}-m\\,\\widehat{CD}) / 2$.  Subsituting $m\\, \\widehat{AB}=180^\\circ$ and $m\\angle AEB=60^\\circ$ into this equation, we find $m\\,\\widehat{CD}=60^\\circ$.  By symmetry, $\\angle AOC$ and $\\angle DOB$ are congruent, so each one measures $(180-60)/2=60$ degrees.  It follows that $AOC$ and $DOB$ are equilateral triangles.  Therefore, we can find the area of each shaded region by subtracting the area of an equilateral triangle from the area of a sector.\n\nThe area of sector $AOC$ is $\\left(\\frac{m\\angle AOC}{360^\\circ}\\right)\\pi (\\text{radius})^2=\\frac{1}{6}\\pi(6)^2=6\\pi$.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4,$ so the area of triangle $AOC$ is $9\\sqrt{3}$.  In total, the area of the shaded region is $2(6\\pi-9\\sqrt{3})=12\\pi-18\\sqrt{3}.$  Therefore, $(a,b,c)=(12,18,3)$ and $a+b+c=\\boxed{33}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The side lengths of a triangle are 14 cm, 48 cm and 50 cm. How many square centimeters are in the area of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Shrinking the triangle by dividing every side length by 2, we recognize the resulting set $$\\{7,24,25\\}$$ of side lengths as a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the original triangle is also a right triangle, and its legs measure 14 cm and 48 cm.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(14\\text{ cm})(48\\text{ cm})=\\boxed{336}$ square centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is circumscribed about an equilateral triangle with side lengths of $9$ units each.  What is the area of the circle, in square units? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8));\ndraw((0,0)--(4.5,7.794)--(9,0)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((4.5,2.598),5.196));\ndraw((4.5,7.794)--(4.5,0));\ndot((4.5,2.598));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(4.5,2.598),W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(4.5,7.794),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(9,0),E);\nlabel(\"$M$\",(4.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\n\nAbove is the diagram implied by the problem, with some added lines ($O$ is the center of the circle). Since $\\triangle AMB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and $AB=9$, $AM=4.5\\sqrt{3}$. Since $AO$ is $2/3$ of $AM$, $AO=3\\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the area of the circle is $\\pi(3\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{27\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square is inscribed in a circle.  A smaller square has one side coinciding with a side of the larger square and has two vertices on the circle, as shown.  What percent of the area of the larger square is the area of the smaller square?\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1.4142));\ndraw((1,1)--(1,-1)--(-1,-1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0.2,1)--(0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1.4142));\ndraw((1,1)--(1,-1)--(-1,-1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0.2,1)--(0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1.4),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0.2,1.4),NE);\ndot((0,0)); dot((0,1.4)); dot((0.2,1.4));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,1.4)--(0.2,1.4)--cycle,red);\n[/asy]\n\nWe label the points as shown.  $A$ is the midpoint of the top side of the square, and $B$ is a vertex of the square.  We look at right triangle $\\triangle OAB$.  We seek a ratio of areas, which remains constant no matter the side lengths, so for simplicity, we let the big square have side length $2$ and the small square have side length $2x$.  Then, $OA=1+2x$, $AB=x$, and $OB$ is a radius of the circle, which has length $\\sqrt{2}$ by 45-45-90 triangles.  Then, the Pythagorean theorem states that $OA^2+AB^2=OB^2$, or \\[(1+2x)^2 + x^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2.\\]   Simplifying the equation yields \\begin{align*}\n& 1+4x+4x^2 + x^2 = 2 \\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow\\ & 5x^2 + 4x-1 =0 \\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow\\ & (5x-1)(x+1).\n\\end{align*} Thus, $x=-1$ or $x=1/5$.  Lengths are clearly positive, so the valid solution is $x=1/5$.  Then the small square has side length $2x=2/5$, and area $(2/5)^2 = 4/25$.  The large square has area $2^2=4$, so the small square has \\[\\frac{4/25}{4}=1/25=\\boxed{4\\%}\\] the area of the large square.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A piece of wire 72 cm long is cut into two equal pieces and each is formed into a circle.
