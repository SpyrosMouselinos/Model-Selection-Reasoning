If a cylindrical section of radius 2 feet is removed from the solid, what is the total remaining volume of the cube? Express your answer in cubic feet in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nimport solids; size(150); import three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); currentprojection = orthographic(4,2.5,3);\n\ndraw((1,-1,0)--(1,1,0)--(-1,1,0)); draw((-1,1,0)--(-1,-1,0)--(1,-1,0), dashed);\ndraw((1,-1,2)--(1,1,2)--(-1,1,2)--(-1,-1,2)--cycle);\ndraw((1,-1,0)--(1,-1,2)); draw((1,1,0)--(1,1,2)); draw((-1,-1,0)--(-1,-1,2),dashed); draw((-1,1,0)--(-1,1,2));revolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), 1, 2);\ndraw(c,black);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cube has volume $4^3=64$ cubic feet.  The cylinder has radius 2, height 4, and volume $\\pi(2^2)(4)=16\\pi$ cubic feet.  It follows that when the cylindrical section is removed from the solid, the remaining volume is $\\boxed{64-16\\pi}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn.

Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the sphere.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sphere's radius be $r$.  From the sphere's circumference we have $2\\pi r = 12\\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r = 6$.  The volume of the sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6^3) = 36\\cdot 8 \\pi$.  The volume of one wedge is one-fourth this volume, or $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 6^2\\cdot 8 \\pi = 6^2\\cdot 2\\pi = \\boxed{72\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The same amount of steel used to create eight solid steel balls, each with a radius of 1 inch, is used to create one larger steel ball.

We have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{32}{3}\\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r^3 = 8 \\Rightarrow r = 2$.  Thus the radius of the large ball is $\\boxed{2}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. What is the ratio of the volume of the inscribed sphere to the volume of the cube? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(60);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nLet the side length of the cube be $s$.  The side length of the cube is equal to diameter of the inscribed sphere, so the radius of the sphere has length $\\frac{s}{2}$.  Thus, the volume of the sphere is equal to $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{\\pi s^3}{6}$ and the volume of the cube is equal to $s^3$.  Hence the ratio of the sphere's volume to the cube's volume is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Ten unit cubes are glued together as shown.

The figure has a height of 3, so there 6 sq. units total in each of the vertical sides.  And the figure has a total width of 4 cubes, so despite the fact that there is overlap, there is still a horizontal width of 4, making for 4 sq. units in each of the horizontal sides, making 8 total sq. units.  Thus, there is a total of $10 + 10 + 8 + 6 = \\boxed{34\\text{ sq. units}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has edges of length 1 cm and has a dot marked in the centre of the top face.  The cube is sitting on a flat table.  The cube is rolled, without lifting or slipping, in one direction so that at least two of its vertices are always touching the table.  The cube is rolled until the dot is again on the top face.  The length, in centimeters, of the path followed by the dot is $c\\pi$, where $c$ is a constant.  What is $c$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Suppose the cube rolls first over edge $AB$.\n\nConsider the cube as being made up of two half-cubes (each of dimensions $1 \\times 1 \\times \\frac{1}{2}$) glued together at square $PQMN$.  (Note that $PQMN$ lies on a vertical plane.)\n\nSince dot $D$ is in the centre of the top face, then $D$ lies on square $PQMN$.

In the first segment of the roll, we start with $NM$ on the table and roll, keeping $M$ stationary, until $Q$ lands on the table.

Since $D$ is at a constant distance of $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ from $M$, then $D$ rotates along one-quarter (since $90^\\circ$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ of $360^\\circ$) of a circle of radius $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, for a distance of $\\frac{1}{4}\\left( 2\\pi\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}\\pi$.\n\nIn the next segment of the roll, $Q$ stays stationary and the square rolls until $P$ touches the table.  [asy]\n//C24S3\n\nsize(4cm); // ADJUST\n\n// Draw outline\ndraw(unitsquare);\ndraw((0, 0)--(-1, 0)--(-1, 1)--(0, 1), dashed);\ndraw((-1, 0)--(-2, 0)--(-2, 1)--(-1, 1), dashed);\n\n// Labels and dots\ndot((-1.5, 1));\nlabel(\"$M$\", (0, 1), N);\nlabel(\"$Q$\", (0, 0), S);\nlabel(\"$P$\", (1, 0), SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", (0.5, 0), S); dot((0.5, 0));\nlabel(\"$N$\", (1, 1), NE);\ndot((0, 0.5));\n\n// Draw arc\ndraw(reverse(arc((0, 0), (0.5, 0), (0, 0.5))), dashed, MidArcArrow(size=6));\n[/asy] Again, the roll is one of $90^\\circ$.  Note that $QD = \\frac{1}{2}$.  Thus, again $D$ moves through one-quarter of a circle this time of radius $\\frac{1}{2}$,  for a distance of $\\frac{1}{4}\\left( 2\\pi \\frac{1}{2}\\right) =\\frac{1}{4}\\pi$.\n\nThrough the next segment of the roll, $P$ stays stationary and the square rolls until $N$ touches the table.  This is similar to the second segment, so $D$ rolls through a distance of $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi$.\n\nThrough the next segment of the roll, $N$ stays stationary and the square rolls until $M$ touches the table.  This will be the end of the process as the square will end up in its initial position.  This segment is similar to the first segment so $D$ rolls through a distance of $\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}\\pi$.\n\nTherefore, the total distance through which the dot travels is  $$\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}\\pi+\\frac{1}{4}\\pi+\\frac{1}{4}\\pi+\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}\\pi$$or $$\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)\\pi,$$so our final answer is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The length of the diameter of this spherical ball is equal to the height of the box in which it is placed.
