    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cone is inverted and filled with water to 3/4 of its height.  What percent of the cone's volume is filled with water?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest ten-thousandth.  (You should enter 10.0000 for $10\\%$ instead of 0.1000.)\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cone have height $h$ and radius $r$, so its volume is \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2h.\\]When the cone is filled with water, the amount of water in the cone forms a smaller cone that is similar to the original cone.  This smaller cone has height $\\frac{3}{4}h$, and by similar triangles, radius $\\frac{3}{4}r$.  So, the smaller cone has volume \\[\\frac{1}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{3}{4}r\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}h\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi \\cdot \\frac{3^3}{4^3} r^2h.\\]Hence the ratio of the volume of the water-filled cone to the original cone is \\[\\frac{3^3}{4^3}=\\frac{27}{64}=0.421875,\\]which, as a percentage, is $\\boxed{42.1875}\\%$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylindrical oil tank is $15$ feet tall and its circular bases have diameters of $4$ feet each. When the tank is lying flat on its side (not on one of the circular ends), the oil inside is $3$ feet deep. How deep, in feet, would the oil have been if the tank had been standing upright on one of its bases? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the oil is $3$ feet deep, we want to find the ratio of the area of the part of the circle covered with oil (part under the horizontal line of the figure below) to the entire area of the circle.\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2));\ndraw((-1.732,1)--(1.732,1));\ndraw((0,0)--(-1.732,1));\ndraw((0,0)--(1.732,1));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,1));\n[/asy] The two radii drawn makes a $120$ degree angle, so the area of the fraction of the circle covered by the oil is $\\frac23$ of the circle in addition to the isosceles triangle. We can find the length of half the base of the isosceles triangle by using the Pythagorean theorem on the smaller right triangle. Setting half the length of the base to $x$, we have $x^2+1=4$, so $x=\\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the base is $2\\sqrt3$. Therefore, we have that the area of the triangle is $\\frac12 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2\\sqrt3=\\sqrt3$. So, the area of the part of the circle that's covered in oil is $\\frac23 \\cdot 4\\pi + \\sqrt3=\\frac83\\pi+\\sqrt3$.\n\nThus, we have that the oil takes up $\\dfrac{\\frac83\\pi+\\sqrt3}{4\\pi} \\approx \\frac{10.11}{12.57} \\approx 0.805$ of the cylinder.\n\nWith the cylinder upright, the fraction of the cylinder the oil covers is the same as the fraction of the height the oil covers. Therefore, the oil would be $15 \\text{ feet} \\cdot 0.805 \\approx 12.08 \\approx \\boxed{12.1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid with volume 40 cubic inches has a rectangular base. If the length of the base is doubled, the width tripled and the height increased by $50\\%$, what is the volume of the new pyramid, in cubic inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the volume of a pyramid is linear in each of length, width, and height (in particular, $V = \\frac{1}{3} lwh$), multiplying any of these dimensions by a scalar multiplies the volume by the same scalar.  So the new volume is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 1.50 = 9$ times the old one, or $\\boxed{360}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A bottled water company has designed a new cup for its dispenser. The cup will be a right circular cone with a three-inch radius. How tall will the cup need to be to hold 93 cubic inches of water? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\] Therefore, we want $h$ to satisfy \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot h \\ge 93,\\] or \\[h \\ge \\frac{93}{3 \\pi} \\approx 9.87.\\] Therefore, the height must be $\\boxed{10}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cone has a base with a circumference of $16\\pi$ inches and a height of 30 inches. The height of this cone is reduced while the circumference stays the same. The volume of the shorter cone is $192\\pi$ cubic inches. What is the ratio of the shorter height to the original height? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cone have radius $r$ inches; we have $2\\pi r = 16\\pi$, so $r = 8$.  Let the new height of the cone be $h$ inches.  We have $192\\pi = (1/3)\\pi(8^2)(h)$; solving yields $h = 9$.  Thus the ratio of the new height to the original height is $9/30 = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Jimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cylindrical glass is half full of lemonade. The ratio of lemon juice to water in the lemonade is 1:11. If the glass is 6 inches tall and has a diameter of 2 inches, what is the volume of lemon juice in the glass? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can begin by calculating the volume of the liquid in the glass.  Since the glass is half full, the portion filled with liquid has height 3 inches.  The volume will be $\\pi r^2 h=\\pi\\cdot 1^2 \\cdot 3 = 3\\pi$.  Now, since the ratio of lemon juice to water is 1:11, the ratio of lemon juice to the liquid will be 1:(1+11) which is 1:12.  So, the volume of lemon juice in the glass is: $$3\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{12}=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\approx .7854$$ So, the answer is $\\boxed{.79}$ to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The water tank in the diagram below is in the shape of an inverted right circular cone. The radius of its base is 16 feet, and its height is 96 feet. The water in the tank is $25\\%$ of the tank's capacity.  The height of the water in the tank can be written in the form $a\\sqrt[3]{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b$ is not divisible by a perfect cube greater than 1.  What is $a+b$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8pt)+fontsize(8pt));\n\ndraw(shift(0,96)*yscale(0.5)*Circle((0,0),16));\ndraw((-16,96)--(0,0)--(16,96)--(0,96));\n\ndraw(scale(0.75)*shift(0,96)*yscale(0.5)*Circle((0,0),16));\n\ndraw((-18,72)--(-20,72)--(-20,0)--(-18,0));\nlabel(\"water's height\",(-20,36),W);\n\ndraw((20,96)--(22,96)--(22,0)--(20,0));\nlabel(\"96'\",(22,48),E);\n\nlabel(\"16'\",(8,96),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The water in the tank fills a cone, which we will refer to as the water cone, that is similar to the cone-shaped tank itself.  Let the scale factor between the water cone and tank be $x$, so the height of the water cone is $96x$ feet and the radius of the water cone is $16x$ feet.  It follows that the volume of the water cone is $(1/3)\\pi(16x)^2(96x)$ cubic feet.\n\nThe volume of the cone-shaped tank is $(1/3)\\pi(16^2)(96)$.  Since the water cone has $25\\%$ or 1/4 of the volume of the tank, we have  \\[(1/3)\\pi(16x)^2(96x) = (1/4) (1/3)\\pi(16^2)(96).\\]  Simplifying yields $x^3 = 1/4$, so $x = \\sqrt[3]{1/4}$.\n\nFinally, the height of the water in the tank is the height of the water cone, which is  \\[96x=96\\sqrt[3]{1/4}=48\\cdot 2\\sqrt[3]{1/4}=48\\sqrt[3]{(1/4)(8)}={48\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\] feet.  Therefore, we have $a+b=48+2 = \\boxed{50}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square pyramid has a base edge of 32 inches and an altitude of 1 foot. A square pyramid whose altitude is one-fourth of the original altitude is cut away at the apex of the original pyramid. The volume of the remaining frustum is what fractional part of the volume of the original pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid.  The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/4, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/4)^3 = 1/64$ of the volume of the original pyramid.  Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/64) = \\boxed{\\frac{63}{64}}$ of the original pyramid.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An aquarium has a rectangular base that measures 100 cm by 40 cm and has a height of 50 cm. The aquarium is filled with water to a depth of 37 cm. A rock with volume $1000 \\text{cm}^3$ is then placed in the aquarium and completely submerged.
