    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $A(1, 1), B(6, 1), C(3, 7)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that $AB$ has length 5 and is parallel to the $x$-axis. Therefore, the height of the triangle is the difference in the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$, or $7-1 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = \\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ has vertices $A$ and $C$ at $(0,0)$ and $(7,1)$, respectively. What is its area?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Diagonals $\\overline{AC}$, $\\overline{CE}$, $\\overline{EA}$, $\\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{CF}$, and $\\overline{EB}$ divide the hexagon into twelve congruent 30-60-90 triangles, six of which make up equilateral $\\triangle ACE$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G;\n\nA = (0,0);\nC = (7,1);\nE = rotate(60)*(C);\nG = (A + C + E)/3;\nB = 2*G - E;\nD = 2*G - A;\nF = 2*G - C;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--cycle);\ndraw((-2,0)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,-2)--(0,8));\ndraw(A--C--E--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, S);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, dir(0));\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, N);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, W);\n[/asy]\n\nBecause $AC=\\sqrt{7^2+1^2}=\\sqrt{50}$, the area of $\\triangle ACE$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\displaystyle\\left(\\sqrt{50}\\displaystyle\\right)^2=\\frac{25}{2}\\sqrt{3}$. The area of hexagon $ABCDEF$ is $2\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{25}{2}\\sqrt{3}\\displaystyle\\right)=\\boxed{25\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nAn alternate way to start: let $O$ be the center of the hexagon.  Then triangles $ABC,CDE,$ and $EFA$ are congruent to triangles $AOC,COE,$ and $EOA$, respectively.  Thus the area of the hexagon is twice the area of equilateral $\\triangle ACE$.  Then proceed as in the first solution.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices $A(0,8)$, $B(2,0)$, $C(8,0)$.  A vertical line intersects $AC$ at $R$ and $\\overline{BC}$ at $S$, forming triangle $RSC$.  If the area of $\\triangle RSC$ is 12.5, determine the positive difference of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of point $R$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $\\overline{RS}$ is vertical and $S$ lies on $\\overline{BC}$ which is horizontal, $\\triangle RSC$ has a right angle at $S$. $R$ lies on line segment $\\overline{AC}$, which has slope $\\frac{0-8}{8-0}=-1$. Since line $AC$ has a slope of $-1$, it makes an angle of $45^\\circ$ with the $x$-axis, and the angle between lines $RC$ and $SC$ is $45^\\circ$.\n\nSince $\\triangle RSC$ is right-angled at $S$ and has a $45^\\circ$ angle at $C$, then the third-angle must be $180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 45^\\circ = 45^\\circ$, which means that the triangle is right-angled and isosceles.  Let $RS=SC=x$; then the area of $\\triangle RSC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}x^2$.  But we know that this area is 12.5, so $\\frac{1}{2}x^2 = 12.5 \\Rightarrow x^2=25$.  Since $x>0$, we have $x=5$.\n\nThus, $S$ is 5 units to the left of $C$ and has coordinates $(8-5,0)=(3,0)$.  Point $R$ is 5 units above $S$ and has coordinates $(3,0+5)=(3,5)$.  Finally, the desired difference is $5-3=\\boxed{2}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and a point $K$ on $BC$ such that $AK$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$. If $AC = 10,$ $BK = 7$, and $BC = 13,$ then what is the area of $\\triangle ABC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we sketch! [asy]\npair A, B, C, K;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-7, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nK = (0, 0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--K);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$K$\", K, NE);\nlabel(\"10\", C--A, NE);\nlabel(\"7\", B--K, N);\nlabel(\"13\", B--C, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,K,B,10));\n[/asy] We now see that $CK = BC - BK = 6.$ That means $\\triangle AKC$ is a $3:4:5$ right triangle, so $AK = 8.$ At this point, we can see that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AK \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{52}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ is inscribed in triangle $EFG$ such that side $AD$ of the rectangle is on side $EG$ of the triangle, as shown. The triangle's altitude from $F$ to side $EG$ is 7 inches, and $EG = 10 \\text{ inches}$. The length of segment $AB$ is equal to half the length of segment $AD$. What is the area of rectangle $ABCD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\nimport math;\nsize(101);\nreal x = 35/12;\ncurrentpen = linewidth(1)+fontsize(10pt);\npair E1 = (0,0), G = (10,0), F = (3,7), A = (3*x/7,0), D = G - (7*x/7,0), B = extension(E1,F,A,A+(0,1)), C = extension(G,F,D,D+(0,1));\ndraw(E1--F--G--cycle); draw(A--B--C--D); label(\"$A$\",A,S); label(\"$B$\",B,NW); label(\"$C$\",C,NE); label(\"$D$\",D,S); label(\"$E$\",E1,W); label(\"$F$\",F,NNW); label(\"$G$\",G,ESE);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Suppose that the altitude from $F$ to $EG$ intersects $EG$ at point $H$.  Then $\\triangle EAB \\sim \\triangle EHF$, and we have that $\\frac{HE}{HF} = \\frac{AE}{AB}$.  Also, $\\triangle GDC \\sim GHF$, and $\\frac{HG}{HF} = \\frac{DG}{DC}$.  Adding these equalities, we find that $\\frac{HE + HG}{HF} = \\frac{AE + DG}{AB}$, since $AB = DC$.  But $HE + HG = EG = 10$, $HF = 7$, and finally $AE + DG = EG - AD = 10 - 2AB$.  Plugging in, we find that $\\frac{10}{7} = \\frac{10-2AB}{AB}$, or $AB = \\frac{35}{12}$.  Thus the area of $ABCD$ is $\\frac{35}{12}\\cdot\\frac{35}{6} =\\boxed{ \\frac{1225}{72}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The rectangle with vertices $(-1, y), (7, y), (-1, 3)$, and $(7, 3)$ has an area of 72 square units, and $y$ is positive. What is the value of $y$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First we write the rectangle's side lengths in terms of the coordinates provided. The length is $7-(-1)=8$ and the height is $y-3.$ It follows that $8(y-3)=72,$ and $y=\\boxed{12}.$ [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(4cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nxaxis(Arrows(4));\nyaxis(ymin=-2,Arrows(4));\npair A=(-1,12), B=(7,12), C=(-1,3), D=(7,3);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--D--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$8$\",(A+B)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$y-3$\",(B+D)/2,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system, trapezoid $ABCD$ has vertices $A(1, -2)$, $B(1, 1)$, $C(5, 7)$ and $D(5, 1)$. What is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two bases of the trapezoids are the segments $AB$ and $CD$, and the height is the perpendicular distance between the bases, which in this case is the difference of the $x$-coordinates: $5 - 1 = 4$. Similarly, the lengths of the bases are the differences of the $y$-coordinates of their two endpoints. Using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1+ b_2)h$, the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(3+6)(4) = \\boxed{18}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In $\\triangle ABC$, we have $AC=BC=7$  and $AB=2$. Suppose that  $D$ is a point on line $AB$ such that $B$ lies between $A$ and $D$ and $CD=8$. What is  $BD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $\\overline{CH}$  be an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\\triangle CHB$ and to $\\triangle CHD$ produces \\[\n8^2 - (BD +1)^2 = CH^2 = 7^2 - 1^2 = 48, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad (BD+1)^2 = 16.\n\\] Thus $BD = \\boxed{3}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5cm);\npair A,B,C,D,H;\nA=(0,0);\nH=(1,0);\nB=(2,0);\nD=(5,0);\nC=(1,6);\ndraw(A--C--D--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(H--C--B--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"1\",(0.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"1\",(1.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"7\",(0.5,3),NW);\nlabel(\"7\",(1.5,3),NE);\nlabel(\"8\",(3.5,3),NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\nlabel(\"$H$\",H,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 7$, $AC = 15$, and the length of median $AM$ is 10.  Find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Extend $AM$ to $D$ so that $MD = MA$.  Then triangles $AMB$ and $DMC$ are congruent, so triangles $ABC$ and $ACD$ have equal area.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, M;\n\nA = (-7/sqrt(37),42/sqrt(37));\nB = (0,0);\nC = (2*sqrt(37),0);\nM = (B + C)/2;\nD = 2*M - A;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D--C);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$7$\", (A + B)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$15$\", (A + C)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (A + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (D + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$7$\", (C + D)/2, E);\n[/asy]\n\nThe semi-perimeter of triangle $ACD$ is $(7 + 15 + 20)/2 = 21$, so by Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ACD$ is $$\\sqrt{21 (21 - 7)(21 - 15)(21 - 20)} = \\boxed{42}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Convex pentagon $ABCDE$ has side lengths $AB=5$, $BC=CD=DE=6$, and $EA=7$. Moreover, the pentagon has an inscribed circle (a circle tangent to each side of the pentagon). Find the area of $ABCDE$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Assume the incircle touches $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, $DE$, $EA$ at $P,Q,R,S,T$ respectively. Then let $PB=x=BQ=RD=SD$, $ET=y=ES=CR=CQ$, $AP=AT=z$. So we have $x+y=6$, $x+z=5$ and $y+z$=7, solve it we have $x=2$, $z=3$, $y=4$. Let the center of the incircle be $I$, by SAS we can proof triangle $BIQ$ is congruent to triangle $DIS$, and triangle $CIR$ is congruent to triangle $SIE$. Then we have $\\angle AED=\\angle BCD$, $\\angle ABC=\\angle CDE$. Extend $CD$, cross ray $AB$ at $M$, ray $AE$ at $N$, then by AAS we have triangle $END$ is congruent to triangle $BMC$. Thus $\\angle M=\\angle N$. Let $EN=MC=a$, then $BM=DN=a+2$. So by law of cosine in triangle $END$ and triangle $ANM$ we can obtain\\[\\frac{2a+8}{2(a+7)}=\\cos N=\\frac{a^2+(a+2)^2-36}{2a(a+2)}\\], solved it gives us $a=8$, which yield triangle $ANM$ to be a triangle with side length 15, 15, 24, draw a height from $A$ to $NM$ divides it into two triangles with side lengths 9, 12, 15, so the area of triangle $ANM$ is 108. Triangle $END$ is a triangle with side lengths 6, 8, 10, so the area of two of them is 48, so the area of pentagon is $108-48=\\boxed{60}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $A(2,2)$ and $B(7,7)$ be points in the plane. Define $R$ as the region in the first quadrant consisting of those points $C$ such that $\\triangle ABC$ is an acute triangle. What is the area of the region $R$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
