    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In $\\triangle ABC$ the ratio $AC:CB$ is $3:4$. The bisector of the exterior angle at $C$ intersects $BA$ extended at $P$ ($A$ is between $P$ and $B$). The ratio $PA:AB$ is:\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 1:3 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 3:4 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 4:3 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 3:1 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 7:1$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] draw((0,0)--(40,0)--(16,18)--(0,0)); draw((40,0)--(64,72)--(16,18)); draw((40,0)--(160,0)--(64,72),dotted); dot((0,0)); label(\"B\",(0,0),SW); dot((16,18)); label(\"A\",(16,18),NW); dot((40,0)); label(\"C\",(40,0),S); dot((64,72)); label(\"P\",(64,72),N); dot((160,0)); label(\"X\",(160,0),SE);  label(\"$4n$\",(20,0),S); label(\"$3n$\",(33,17)); label(\"$4an-4n$\",(100,0),S); label(\"$3an$\",(112,36),NE); [/asy]Let $AC = 3n$ and $BC = 4n$. Draw $X$, where $X$ is on $BC$ and $AC \\parallel PX$. By AA Similarity, $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle PBX$, so $PX = 3an$, $BX = 4an$, and $CX = 4an - 4n$.\nAlso, let $\\angle ABC = a$ and $\\angle BAC = b$. Since the angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\\circ}$, $\\angle BCA = 180-a-b$. By Exterior Angle Theorem, $\\angle ACX = a+b$, and since $CP$ bisects $\\angle ACX$, $\\angle PCX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$. Because $AC \\parallel PX$, $\\angle BXP = 180 - a - b$. Thus, $\\angle CPX = \\frac{a+b}{2}$, making $\\triangle CPX$ an isosceles triangle.\nBecause $\\triangle CPX$ is isosceles, $PX = CX$, so $4an - 4n = 3an$. That means $a = 4$, so $PB = 4 \\cdot AB$. Thus, $PA = PB - AB = 3 \\cdot AB$, so $PA : AB = \\boxed{3:1}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Equilateral $\\triangle ABC$ has side length $600$. Points $P$ and $Q$ lie outside the plane of $\\triangle ABC$ and are on opposite sides of the plane. Furthermore, $PA=PB=PC$, and $QA=QB=QC$, and the planes of $\\triangle PAB$ and $\\triangle QAB$ form a $120^{\\circ}$ dihedral angle (the angle between the two planes). There is a point $O$ whose distance from each of $A,B,C,P,$ and $Q$ is $d$. Find $d$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The inradius of $\\triangle ABC$ is $100\\sqrt 3$ and the circumradius is $200 \\sqrt 3$. Now, consider the line perpendicular to plane $ABC$ through the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$. Note that $P,Q,O$ must lie on that line to be equidistant from each of the triangle's vertices. Also, note that since $P, Q, O$ are collinear, and $OP=OQ$, we must have $O$ is the midpoint of $PQ$. Now, Let $K$ be the circumcenter of $\\triangle ABC$, and $L$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $BC$. We must have $\\tan(\\angle KLP+ \\angle QLK)= \\tan(120^{\\circ})$. Setting $KP=x$ and $KQ=y$, assuming WLOG $x>y$, we must have $\\tan(120^{\\circ})=-\\sqrt{3}=\\dfrac{\\dfrac{x+y}{100 \\sqrt{3}}}{\\dfrac{30000-xy}{30000}}$. Therefore, we must have $100(x+y)=xy-30000$. Also, we must have $\\left(\\dfrac{x+y}{2}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\dfrac{x-y}{2}\\right)^{2}+120000$ by the Pythagorean theorem, so we have $xy=120000$, so substituting into the other equation we have $90000=100(x+y)$, or $x+y=900$. Since we want $\\dfrac{x+y}{2}$, the desired answer is $\\boxed{450}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a regular tetrahedron the centers of the four faces are the vertices of a smaller tetrahedron. The ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to that of the larger is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Embed the tetrahedron in 4-space to make calculations easier. Its vertices are $(1,0,0,0)$, $(0,1,0,0)$, $(0,0,1,0)$, $(0,0,0,1)$.\nTo get the center of any face, we take the average of the three coordinates of that face. The vertices of the center of the faces are: $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, 0)$,$(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3},0, \\frac{1}{3})$,$(\\frac{1}{3},0, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$,$(0,\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\nThe side length of the large tetrahedron is $\\sqrt{2}$ by the distance formula. The side length of the smaller tetrahedron is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$ by the distance formula.\nTheir ratio is $1:3$, so the ratio of their volumes is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}$.\n$m+n = 1 + 27 = \\boxed{28}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle PQR$ be a triangle in the plane, and let $S$ be a point outside the plane of $\\triangle PQR$, so that $SPQR$ is a pyramid whose faces are all triangles.\n\nSuppose that every edge of $SPQR$ has length $18$ or $41$, but no face of $SPQR$ is equilateral. Then what is the surface area of $SPQR$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since all edges of pyramid $SPQR$ have length $18$ or $41$, each triangular face must be isosceles: either $18$-$18$-$41$ or $18$-$41$-$41$. But the first of these two sets of side lengths violates the triangle inequality, since $18+18<41$. Therefore, every face of $SPQR$ must have sides of lengths $18,$ $41,$ and $41$.\n\nTo find the area of each face, we draw an $18$-$41$-$41$ triangle with altitude $h$: [asy]\nsize(4cm);\npair a=(0,40); pair b=(-9,0); pair c=(9,0); pair o=(0,0);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); draw(a--b--c--a); draw(a--o,dashed); draw(rightanglemark(a,o,c,60));\nlabel(\"$h$\",(a+2*o)/3,SE);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+c)/2,E);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+c)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+b)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+b)/2,N);\n[/asy] Since the triangle is isosceles, we know the altitude bisects the base (as marked above). By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $9^2+h^2=41^2$ and thus $h=40$. So, the triangle has area $\\frac 12\\cdot 18\\cdot 40 = 360$.\n\nThe surface area of pyramid $SPQR$ is made up of four such triangles, so it amounts to $4\\cdot 360 = \\boxed{1440}$.\n\n${\\bf Remark.}$  One might wonder whether a pyramid with the properties enumerated in the problem actually exists. The answer is yes! To form such a pyramid, imagine attaching two $18$-$41$-$41$ triangles (like that in the diagram) along their short edges, so that the triangles are free to rotate around that hinge: [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple a=(9,0,0); triple b=-a; triple c=(0,sqrt(1519),-9); triple d=(0,sqrt(1519),9);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); dot(d);\ndraw(surface(a--b--c--cycle),orange,nolight);\ndraw(b--c--a);\ndraw(surface(a--b--d--cycle),yellow,nolight);\ndraw(b--d--a--b);\ndraw(c--d,dashed);\n[/asy] Now you can adjust the distance between the two \"free\" vertices (the dotted line in the diagram above) so that it is $18$. Adding that edge to the diagram and filling in, we have a pyramid with the desired properties.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Euler's formula states that for a convex polyhedron with $V$ vertices, $E$ edges, and $F$ faces, $V-E+F=2$. A particular convex polyhedron has 32 faces, each of which is either a triangle or a pentagon. At each of its $V$ vertices, $T$ triangular faces and $P$ pentagonal faces meet. What is the value of $100P+10T+V$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The convex polyhedron of the problem can be easily visualized; it corresponds to a dodecahedron (a regular solid with $12$ equilateral pentagons) in which the $20$ vertices have all been truncated to form $20$ equilateral triangles with common vertices. The resulting solid has then $p=12$ smaller equilateral pentagons and $t=20$ equilateral triangles yielding a total of $t+p=F=32$ faces. In each vertex, $T=2$ triangles and $P=2$ pentagons are concurrent. Now, the number of edges $E$ can be obtained if we count the number of sides that each triangle and pentagon contributes: $E=\\frac{3t+5p}{2}$, (the factor $2$ in the denominator is because we are counting twice each edge, since two adjacent faces share one edge). Thus, $E=60$. Finally, using Euler's formula we have $V=E-30=30$.\nIn summary, the solution to the problem is $100P+10T+V=\\boxed{250}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Faces $ABC$ and $BCD$ of tetrahedron $ABCD$ meet at an angle of $30^\\circ$. The area of face $ABC$ is $120$, the area of face $BCD$ is $80$, and $BC=10$. Find the volume of the tetrahedron.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the area $BCD=80=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10\\cdot16$, the perpendicular from $D$ to $BC$ has length $16$.\nThe perpendicular from $D$ to $ABC$ is $16 \\cdot \\sin 30^\\circ=8$. Therefore, the volume is $\\frac{8\\cdot120}{3}=\\boxed{320}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The six edges of a tetrahedron $ABCD$ measure $7, 13, 18, 27, 36$ and $41$ units. If the length of edge $AB$ is $41$, then the length of edge $CD$ is\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 7\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 13\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 18\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 27\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 36$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the triangle inequality in $\\triangle ABC$, we find that $BC$ and $CA$ must sum to greater than $41$, so they must be (in some order) $7$ and $36$, $13$ and $36$, $18$ and $27$, $18$ and $36$, or $27$ and $36$. We try $7$ and $36$, and now by the triangle inequality in $\\triangle ABD$, we must use the remaining numbers $13$, $18$, and $27$ to get a sum greater than $41$, so the only possibility is $18$ and $27$. This works as we can put $BC = 36$, $AC = 7$, $AD = 18$, $BD = 27$, $CD = 13$, so that $\\triangle ADC$ and $\\triangle BDC$ also satisfy the triangle inequality. Hence we have found a solution that works, and it can be verified that the other possibilities don't work, though as this is a multiple-choice competition, you probably wouldn't do that in order to save time. In any case, the answer is $CD = \\boxed{13}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $ABCD$ is a regular tetrahedron (right triangular pyramid).  If $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{CD}$, then what is $\\cos \\angle AMB$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The tetrahedron is shown below.  In order to find $\\cos \\angle AMB$, we build a right triangle with $\\angle AMB$ among its angles.  The foot of the altitude from $A$ to face $BCD$ is the centroid, $G$, of triangle $BCD$.\n\n[asy]\nimport three;\ncurrentprojection = orthographic(1.5,1.1,-1);\ntriple A = (1,1,1);\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\ntriple C = (0,1,0);\ntriple D = (0,0,1);\ndraw(A--B--C--A);\ndraw(A--D,dashed);\ndraw(C--D--B,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NW);\ntriple M = (0,0.5,0.5);\ndraw(A--M--B,dashed);\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,NE);\ntriple G = B/3 + 2*M/3;\ndraw(A--G,dashed);\nlabel(\"$G$\",G,S);\n\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\overline{BM}$ is a median of $\\triangle BCD$, point $G$ is on $\\overline{BM}$ such that $GM = \\frac13BM$.  Furthermore, we have $AM = BM$, so  \\[\\cos \\angle AMB= \\cos \\angle AMG = \\frac{GM}{AM} = \\frac{(BM/3)}{BM}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In tetrahedron $ABCD$, edge $AB$ has length 3 cm. The area of face $ABC$ is $15\\mbox{cm}^2$ and the area of face $ABD$ is $12 \\mbox { cm}^2$. These two faces meet each other at a $30^\\circ$ angle. Find the volume of the tetrahedron in $\\mbox{cm}^3$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n It is clear that $DX=8$ and $CX=10$ where $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ and $C$ to side $AB$. Thus $[DXC]=\\frac{ab\\sin{c}}{2}=20=5 \\cdot h \\rightarrow h = 4$ where h is the height of the tetrahedron from $D$. Hence, the volume of the tetrahedron is $\\frac{bh}{3}=15\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A tetrahedron with four equilateral triangular faces has a sphere inscribed within it and a sphere circumscribed about it. For each of the four faces, there is a sphere tangent externally to the face at its center and to the circumscribed sphere. A point $P$ is selected at random inside the circumscribed sphere. The probability that $P$ lies inside one of the five small spheres is closest to\n$\\mathrm{(A) \\ }0 \\qquad \\mathrm{(B) \\ }0.1 \\qquad \\mathrm{(C) \\ }0.2 \\qquad \\mathrm{(D) \\ }0.3 \\qquad \\mathrm{(E) \\ }0.4$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the radius of the large sphere be $R$, and of the inner sphere $r$. Label the vertices of the tetrahedron $ABCD$, and let $O$ be the center. Then pyramid $[OABC] + [OABD] + [OACD] + [OBCD] = [ABCD]$, where $[\\ldots]$ denotes volume; thus $[OABC] = \\frac{[ABCD]}{4}$. Since $OABC$ and $ABCD$ are both pyramids that share a common face $ABC$, the ratio of their volumes is the ratio of their altitudes to face $ABC$, so $r = \\frac {h_{ABCD}}4$. However, $h_{ABCD} = r + R$, so it follows that $r = \\frac {R}{3}$. Then the radius of an external sphere is $\\frac{R-r}2 = \\frac {R}{3} = r$.\nSince the five described spheres are non-intersecting, it follows that the ratio of the volumes of the spheres is $5 \\cdot \\left( \\frac 13 \\right)^3 = \\frac{5}{27} \\approx \\boxed{.2}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular tetrahedron is a pyramid with four faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle.\n\nLet $ABCD$ be a regular tetrahedron and let $P$ be the unique point equidistant from points $A,B,C,D$. Extend $\\overrightarrow{AP}$ to hit face $BCD$ at point $Q$. What is the ratio $PQ/AQ$ ?\n\nAnswer:\n",
