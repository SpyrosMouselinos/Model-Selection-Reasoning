    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In tetrahedron $ABCD$, edge $AB$ has length 3 cm. The area of face $ABC$ is $15\\mbox{cm}^2$ and the area of face $ABD$ is $12 \\mbox { cm}^2$. These two faces meet each other at a $30^\\circ$ angle. Find the volume of the tetrahedron in $\\mbox{cm}^3$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n It is clear that $DX=8$ and $CX=10$ where $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ and $C$ to side $AB$. Thus $[DXC]=\\frac{ab\\sin{c}}{2}=20=5 \\cdot h \\rightarrow h = 4$ where h is the height of the tetrahedron from $D$. Hence, the volume of the tetrahedron is $\\frac{bh}{3}=15\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A solid right prism $ABCDEF$ has a height of $16,$ as shown. Also, its bases are equilateral triangles with side length $12.$ Points $X,$ $Y,$ and $Z$ are the midpoints of edges $AC,$ $BC,$ and $DC,$ respectively. A part of the prism above is sliced off with a straight cut through points $X,$ $Y,$ and $Z.$ Determine the surface area of solid $CXYZ,$ the part that was sliced off.  [asy]\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, X, Y, Z;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(12,0);\nC=(6,-6);\nD=(6,-22);\nE=(0,-16);\nF=(12,-16);\nX=(A+C)/2;\nY=(B+C)/2;\nZ=(C+D)/2;\ndraw(A--B--C--A--E--D--F--B--C--D);\ndraw(X--Y--Z--X, dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, SE);\nlabel(\"$X$\", X, SW);\nlabel(\"$Y$\", Y, SE);\nlabel(\"$Z$\", Z, SE);\nlabel(\"12\", (A+B)/2, dir(90));\nlabel(\"16\", (B+F)/2, dir(0));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To determine the surface area of solid $CXYZ,$ we determine the area of each of the four triangular faces and sum them.\n\nAreas of $\\triangle CZX$ and $\\triangle CZY:$\n\nEach of these triangles is right-angled and has legs of lengths 6 and 8; therefore, the area of each is $\\frac{1}{2}(6)(8)=24$.\n\nArea of $\\triangle CXY:$\n\nThis triangle is equilateral with side length $6.$ We draw the altitude from $C$ to $M$ on $XY.$ Since $\\triangle CXY$ is equilateral, then $M$ is the midpoint of $XY.$\n\nThus, $\\triangle CMX$ and $\\triangle CMY$ are $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangles. Using the ratios from this special triangle, $$CM = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(CX)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(6)=3\\sqrt{3}.$$Since $XY = 6,$ the area of $\\triangle CXY$ is $$\\frac{1}{2}(6)(3\\sqrt{3})=9\\sqrt{3}.$$Area of $\\triangle XYZ:$\n\nWe have $XY = 6$ and $XZ = YZ = 10$ and drop an altitude from $Z$ to $XY.$ Since $\\triangle XYZ$ is isosceles, this altitude meets $XY$ at its midpoint, $M,$ and we have $$XM = MY = \\frac{1}{2}(XY)=3.$$By the Pythagorean Theorem,  \\begin{align*}\nZM &= \\sqrt{ZX^2 - XM^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{10^2-3^2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{91}.\n\\end{align*}Since $XY = 6,$ the area of $\\triangle XYZ$ is $$\\frac{1}{2}(6)(\\sqrt{91})=3\\sqrt{91}.$$Finally, the total surface area of solid $CXYZ$ is $$24+24+9\\sqrt{3}+3\\sqrt{91}=\\boxed{48+9\\sqrt{3}+3\\sqrt{91}}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Faces $ABC$ and $BCD$ of tetrahedron $ABCD$ meet at an angle of $30^\\circ$. The area of face $ABC$ is $120$, the area of face $BCD$ is $80$, and $BC=10$. Find the volume of the tetrahedron.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the area $BCD=80=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10\\cdot16$, the perpendicular from $D$ to $BC$ has length $16$.\nThe perpendicular from $D$ to $ABC$ is $16 \\cdot \\sin 30^\\circ=8$. Therefore, the volume is $\\frac{8\\cdot120}{3}=\\boxed{320}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The six edges of a tetrahedron $ABCD$ measure $7, 13, 18, 27, 36$ and $41$ units. If the length of edge $AB$ is $41$, then the length of edge $CD$ is\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 7\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 13\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 18\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 27\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 36$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the triangle inequality in $\\triangle ABC$, we find that $BC$ and $CA$ must sum to greater than $41$, so they must be (in some order) $7$ and $36$, $13$ and $36$, $18$ and $27$, $18$ and $36$, or $27$ and $36$. We try $7$ and $36$, and now by the triangle inequality in $\\triangle ABD$, we must use the remaining numbers $13$, $18$, and $27$ to get a sum greater than $41$, so the only possibility is $18$ and $27$. This works as we can put $BC = 36$, $AC = 7$, $AD = 18$, $BD = 27$, $CD = 13$, so that $\\triangle ADC$ and $\\triangle BDC$ also satisfy the triangle inequality. Hence we have found a solution that works, and it can be verified that the other possibilities don't work, though as this is a multiple-choice competition, you probably wouldn't do that in order to save time. In any case, the answer is $CD = \\boxed{13}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle PQR$ be a triangle in the plane, and let $S$ be a point outside the plane of $\\triangle PQR$, so that $SPQR$ is a pyramid whose faces are all triangles.\n\nSuppose that every edge of $SPQR$ has length $18$ or $41$, but no face of $SPQR$ is equilateral. Then what is the surface area of $SPQR$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since all edges of pyramid $SPQR$ have length $18$ or $41$, each triangular face must be isosceles: either $18$-$18$-$41$ or $18$-$41$-$41$. But the first of these two sets of side lengths violates the triangle inequality, since $18+18<41$. Therefore, every face of $SPQR$ must have sides of lengths $18,$ $41,$ and $41$.\n\nTo find the area of each face, we draw an $18$-$41$-$41$ triangle with altitude $h$: [asy]\nsize(4cm);\npair a=(0,40); pair b=(-9,0); pair c=(9,0); pair o=(0,0);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); draw(a--b--c--a); draw(a--o,dashed); draw(rightanglemark(a,o,c,60));\nlabel(\"$h$\",(a+2*o)/3,SE);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+c)/2,E);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+c)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+b)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+b)/2,N);\n[/asy] Since the triangle is isosceles, we know the altitude bisects the base (as marked above). By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $9^2+h^2=41^2$ and thus $h=40$. So, the triangle has area $\\frac 12\\cdot 18\\cdot 40 = 360$.\n\nThe surface area of pyramid $SPQR$ is made up of four such triangles, so it amounts to $4\\cdot 360 = \\boxed{1440}$.\n\n${\\bf Remark.}$  One might wonder whether a pyramid with the properties enumerated in the problem actually exists. The answer is yes! To form such a pyramid, imagine attaching two $18$-$41$-$41$ triangles (like that in the diagram) along their short edges, so that the triangles are free to rotate around that hinge: [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple a=(9,0,0); triple b=-a; triple c=(0,sqrt(1519),-9); triple d=(0,sqrt(1519),9);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); dot(d);\ndraw(surface(a--b--c--cycle),orange,nolight);\ndraw(b--c--a);\ndraw(surface(a--b--d--cycle),yellow,nolight);\ndraw(b--d--a--b);\ndraw(c--d,dashed);\n[/asy] Now you can adjust the distance between the two \"free\" vertices (the dotted line in the diagram above) so that it is $18$. Adding that edge to the diagram and filling in, we have a pyramid with the desired properties.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid with a square base has total surface area 432 square units.  The area of each triangular face is half the area of the square face. What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $ABCD$ be the base of the pyramid and let $P$ be the pyramid's apex.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport three;\n\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\n\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\n\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\n\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\n\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\n\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\n\ndraw(P--C);\n\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\n\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\n\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\n\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\n\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\n\ndraw(P--F--M,dashed);\n\ndraw(P--M);\n\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\n\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,SW);\n\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base and $M$ be the midpoint of an edge of the square, as shown.  There are four triangular faces, each with area half the area of the square face.  So, the total surface area of the pyramid is 3 times the area of the square face.  Therefore, the area of the square face is $432/3=144$ square units, which means that each side of the square has length 12.\n\nSince the area of the triangle is half the area of the square, we have $(BC)(PM)/2 = 72$, so $(BC)(PM) = 144$, which means $PM = 144/12 = 12$.  Since $F$ is the center of the square base, we have $FM = 6$, so $PF = \\sqrt{12^2 - 6^2} = 6\\sqrt{3}$.  Finally, the volume of the pyramid is \\[\\frac{[ABCD]\\cdot PF}{3} = \\frac{144\\cdot 6\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\boxed{288\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base with side length 10 cm. Its peak is 12 cm above the center of its base. What is the total surface area of the pyramid, in square centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\ndraw(P--C);\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\ndraw(P--F--M,dashed);\ndraw(P--M);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,SW);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base and $M$ be the midpoint of an edge of the square, as shown.  Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFM$ is a right triangle.  We are given $PF = 12$, and we have $FM = (1/2)(AB) = 5$, so the Pythagorean Theorem gives us $PM = \\sqrt{PF^2 + FM^2} = 13$.  Therefore, since the four lateral faces are congruent triangles, the total surface area of the pyramid is \\[[ABCD] + 4[PAB] = 10^2 + 4(13)(10)/2 = \\boxed{360}\\text{ square centimeters}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangular prism has dimensions 8 inches by 2 inches by 32 inches. If a cube has the same volume as the prism, what is the surface area of the cube, in square inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cube has volume $8\\cdot2\\cdot32$ cubic inches, so its edge length is $\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot2\\cdot32}=\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot64}=\\sqrt[3]{8}\\sqrt[3]{64}=2\\cdot4=8$ inches.  The surface area of a cube with edge length 8 inches is $6(8\\text{ in.})^2=\\boxed{384}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a regular tetrahedron the centers of the four faces are the vertices of a smaller tetrahedron. The ratio of the volume of the smaller tetrahedron to that of the larger is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Embed the tetrahedron in 4-space to make calculations easier. Its vertices are $(1,0,0,0)$, $(0,1,0,0)$, $(0,0,1,0)$, $(0,0,0,1)$.\nTo get the center of any face, we take the average of the three coordinates of that face. The vertices of the center of the faces are: $(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, 0)$,$(\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3},0, \\frac{1}{3})$,$(\\frac{1}{3},0, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$,$(0,\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})$.\nThe side length of the large tetrahedron is $\\sqrt{2}$ by the distance formula. The side length of the smaller tetrahedron is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$ by the distance formula.\nTheir ratio is $1:3$, so the ratio of their volumes is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{27}$.\n$m+n = 1 + 27 = \\boxed{28}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has side length $6$. Its vertices are alternately colored black and purple, as shown below. What is the volume of the tetrahedron whose corners are the purple vertices of the cube? (A tetrahedron is a pyramid with a triangular base.)\n\n[asy]\nimport three;\nreal t=-0.05;\ntriple A,B,C,D,EE,F,G,H;\nA = (0,0,0);\nB = (cos(t),sin(t),0);\nD= (-sin(t),cos(t),0);\nC = B+D;\nEE = (0,0,1);\nF = B+EE;\nG = C + EE;\nH = D + EE;\ndraw(surface(B--EE--G--cycle),rgb(.6,.3,.6),nolight);\ndraw(surface(B--D--G--cycle),rgb(.7,.4,.7),nolight);\ndraw(surface(D--EE--G--cycle),rgb(.8,.5,.8),nolight);\ndraw(B--C--D);\ndraw(EE--F--G--H--EE);\ndraw(B--F);\ndraw(C--G);\ndraw(D--H);\npen pu=rgb(.5,.2,.5)+8; pen bk=black+8;\ndot(B,pu); dot(C,bk); dot(D,pu); dot(EE,pu); dot(F,bk); dot(G,pu); dot(H,bk);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of any pyramid is $\\frac 13$ the product of the base area and the height. However, determining the height of the purple tetrahedron is somewhat tricky! Instead of doing that, we observe that the total volume of the cube consists of the purple tetrahedron and four other \"clear\" tetrahedra. Each clear tetrahedron is formed by one of the black vertices of the cube together with its three purple neighbors. The clear tetrahedra are convenient to work with because they have lots of right angles.\n\nEach clear tetrahedron has an isosceles right triangular base of area $\\frac 12\\cdot 6\\cdot 6 = 18$, with corresponding height $6$ (a side of the cube). Thus, each clear tetrahedron has volume $\\frac 13\\cdot 18\\cdot 6 = 36$.\n\nThe cube has volume $6^3 = 216$. The volume of the purple tetrahedron is equal to the volume of the cube minus the volume of the four clear tetrahedra. This is $216 - 4\\cdot 36 = \\boxed{72}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $ABCD$ be a regular tetrahedron with side length 2. The plane parallel to edges $AB$ and $CD$ and lying halfway between them cuts $ABCD$ into two pieces. Find the surface area of one of these pieces.\n\nAnswer:\n",
