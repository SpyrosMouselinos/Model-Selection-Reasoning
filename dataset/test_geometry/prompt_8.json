    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The radius of a sphere is $p$ units and the radius of a hemisphere is $2p$ units. What is the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the hemisphere?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi p^3\\] and the volume of the hemisphere is \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (2p)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi p^3 \\cdot 4.\\] Thus the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the hemisphere is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cylinder with radius 2 is inscribed in a hemisphere with radius 5 so that its bases are parallel to the base of the hemisphere.  What is the height of this cylinder?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We draw and label a diagram as follows: [asy]\n\nsize(110);\npair O = (0,0); pair A = (.3,.94); pair B = (.3,.075);\ndraw(O--A--B--cycle,heavycyan);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W); label(\"$A$\",A,N); label(\"$B$\",B,S);\nimport solids; import three; defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); currentprojection = orthographic(5,0,1.3);\nrevolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), .4, .91);\ndraw(c,black);\n\ndraw(scale(1,.25)*arc((0,0),1,0,180),dashed);\ndraw(scale(1,.25)*arc((0,0),1,180,360));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),1,0,180));\n\n[/asy]\n\nLet the center of the hemisphere be $O$, and let $A$ be a point on the circumference of the top circle of the cylinder.  Since the cylinder is inscribed in the hemisphere, $A$ lies on the hemisphere as well, so $OA=5$.  We drop a perpendicular from $A$ to the base of the hemisphere and let it intersect the base of the hemisphere at $B$.  Since the cylinder is right and $AB$ is a height of the cylinder, $\\angle OBA$ is a right angle, and $B$ lies on the circumference of the bottom circle of the cylinder.  Thus, $OB$ is a radius of the cylinder, so $OB=2$. We have that $\\triangle OBA$ is right, so by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\[AB=\\sqrt{OA^2-OB^2}=\\sqrt{5^2-2^2}=\\sqrt{21}.\\]Thus, the height of the cylinder is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{21}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A spherical soap bubble lands on a horizontal wet surface and forms a hemisphere of the same volume. Given the radius of the hemisphere is $3\\sqrt[3]{2}$ cm, find the radius of the original bubble.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac43\\pi r^3$, so the volume of a hemisphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac23\\pi r^3$. Therefore if a hemisphere of radius $r$ has the same volume as a sphere of radius $R$, we get $\\frac43\\pi R^3=\\frac23 \\pi r^3$. Simplifying gives $R^3=\\frac12 r^3\\Rightarrow R=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}r$. We know that $r=3\\sqrt[3]{2}$ and that $R$ is the quantity we want to solve for, so substituting in our value of $r$ gives $R=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\cdot 3\\sqrt[3]{2}=\\boxed{3}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$. Including the area of its circular base, what is the total surface area of a hemisphere with radius 6 cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport markers;\nsize(150);\nimport geometry;\ndraw((0,-7)--(0,-1),Arrow);\ndraw((10,10)--(5,5),Arrow);\nlabel(\"half of sphere\",(10,10),N);\nlabel(\"circular base\",(0,-7),S);\n\ndraw(scale(1,.2)*arc((0,0),10,0,180),dashed);\ndraw(scale(1,.2)*arc((0,0),10,180,360));\ndraw(Arc((0,0),10,0,180));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The base of the hemisphere is a circle with radius 6 and area $6^2\\pi=36\\pi$.  The curved top of the hemisphere has half the surface area of a full sphere, which has surface area $4\\pi(6^2)=144\\pi$, so the curved top of the hemisphere has $144\\pi/2=72\\pi$.  The total surface area of the hemisphere is $36\\pi+72\\pi=\\boxed{108\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. What is the ratio of the volume of the inscribed sphere to the volume of the cube? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(60);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nLet the side length of the cube be $s$.  The side length of the cube is equal to diameter of the inscribed sphere, so the radius of the sphere has length $\\frac{s}{2}$.  Thus, the volume of the sphere is equal to $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{\\pi s^3}{6}$ and the volume of the cube is equal to $s^3$.  Hence the ratio of the sphere's volume to the cube's volume is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of the base of a hemisphere is $100\\pi$. What is the total surface area of the hemisphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the hemisphere's radius be $r$.  The hemisphere's base is a circle with radius $r$; thus, we have $\\pi r^2 = 100\\pi$.  Taking the positive solution for $r$ yields $r = 10$.  The surface area of the curved part of the hemisphere is half the surface area of a sphere with radius 10, which is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4\\pi (10^2) = 200\\pi$.  The total surface area of the hemisphere is the sum of this curved surface area and the base area, which is $200\\pi+100\\pi=\\boxed{300\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n There are two concentric spheres of radii 3 units and 6 units. What is the volume, in cubic units, of the region within the larger sphere and not within the smaller sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The smaller one has volume $\\frac43\\cdot27\\pi=36\\pi$ cubic units and the larger one $\\frac43\\cdot216\\pi=288\\pi$ cubic units. The volume between them is the difference of their volumes, or $288\\pi-36\\pi=\\boxed{252\\pi}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A truncated cone has horizontal bases with radii 18 and 2. A sphere is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surface of the truncated cone. What is the radius of the sphere?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{DC}$ be parallel diameters of the bottom and top bases, respectively. A great circle of the sphere is tangent to all four sides of trapezoid $ABCD$. Let $E,F$, and $G$ be the points of tangency on $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CD}$, respectively. Then \\[\nFB= EB= 18 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad FC= GC= 2,\n\\]so $BC=20$. If $H$ is on $\\overline{AB}$ such that $\\angle CHB$ is a right angle, then $HB= 18-2=16.$ Thus \\[\nCH=\\sqrt{20^{2}-16^{2}}=12,\n\\]and the radius of the sphere is $(1/2)(12)=\\boxed{6}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.2cm);\npair A,B,C,D,I,F,G,H;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(36,0);\nI=(18,0);\nH=(20,0);\nD=(16,12);\nC=(20,12);\nG=(18,12);\nF=(21.6,10.8);\ndot(F);\ndot(I);\ndot(G);\ndraw(Circle((18,6),6),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(G--I,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(C--H,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"2\",(19,12),N);\ndraw((20,-2)--(36,-2));\ndraw((18,-4)--(36,-4));\ndraw((20,-2.5)--(20,-1.5));\ndraw((36,-2.5)--(36,-1.5));\ndraw((18,-3.5)--(18,-4.5));\ndraw((36,-3.5)--(36,-4.5));\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 16}\",(28,-2),S);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 18}\",(27,-4),S);\nlabel(\"12\",(20,6),E);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I,S);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny $H$}\",H,SE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,NE);\nlabel(\"$G$\",G,SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed inside a hemisphere of radius 2.
