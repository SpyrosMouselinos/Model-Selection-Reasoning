    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two triangles are similar. The ratio of their areas is 1:4. If the height of the smaller triangle is 3 cm, how long is the corresponding height of the larger triangle, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If any linear dimension (such as radius, side length, height, etc.) of a closed, two-dimensional figure is multiplied by $k$ while the shape of the figure remains the same, the area of the figure is multiplied by $k^2$.  Since the area is multiplied by 4 in going from the smaller triangle to the larger triangle, we have $k^2=4$ which implies $k=2$.  Therefore, each linear dimension is multiplied by 2, so the height of the larger triangle is $(3\\text{ cm})\\times2=\\boxed{6}$ centimeters.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The second hand on the clock pictured below is 6 cm long.  How far in centimeters does the tip of this second hand travel during a period of 30 minutes? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),20));\nlabel(\"12\",(0,20),S);\nlabel(\"9\",(-20,0),E);\nlabel(\"6\",(0,-20),N);\nlabel(\"3\",(20,0),W);\ndot((0,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(12,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(-8,10));\ndraw((0,0)--(-11,-14),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"6cm\",(-5.5,-7),SE);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In 30 minutes, the tip of the second hand travels 30 times around the circumference of a circle of radius 6cm. Since the circumference is $2\\pi \\cdot6 = 12\\pi$, the tip of the second hand travels $12\\pi \\cdot 30 = \\boxed{360\\pi}$ centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the ratio of the volume of a cube with edge length six inches to the volume of a cube with edge length one foot? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each side of the smaller cube is half that of the larger cube, so the ratio of the volumes is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of degrees in the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n[asy]\nsize(200);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),5),linewidth(1.2));\npair[] mins;\nfor(int i = 0; i < 60; ++i){\n\nmins[i] = 4.5*dir(-6*i + 90);\n\ndot(mins[i]);\n}\nfor(int i = 1; i <= 12; ++i){\n\nlabel((string)i,mins[5*i % 60],dir(-30*i - 90));\n}\n\nfill(Circle((0,0),0.25));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Six boys stood equally spaced on a circle of radius 40 feet. Each boy walked to all of the other non-adjacent persons on the circle, shook their hands and then returned to his original spot on the circle before the next boy started his trip to shake hands with all of the other non-adjacent boys on the circle. After all six boys had done this, what is the least distance in feet that could have been traveled? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The thicker solid line in the diagram shows the shortest path that one person could travel. The circle is equally divided into six 60-degree arcs, so the short distance is 40 feet, the same as a radius. The dotted line is a diameter that separates the quadrilateral into two 30-60-90 triangles. The longer leg is $(80\\sqrt {3})/2$, or $40\\sqrt{3}$ feet. Each person travels $40\\sqrt{3} + 40 + 40 + 40\\sqrt{3} = 80 + 80\\sqrt{3}$ feet. After all six people did this, $6(80 + 80\\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{480 + 480\\sqrt{3}\\text{ feet}}$ had been traveled.

A tall circular building 100 feet in diameter is centered midway between the paths. At the instant when the building first blocks the line of sight between Jenny and Kenny, they are 200 feet apart. Let $t\\,$ be the amount of time, in seconds, before Jenny and Kenny can see each other again. If $t\\,$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Consider the unit cicle of radius 50. Assume that they start at points $(-50,100)$ and $(-50,-100).$ Then at time $t$, they end up at points $(-50+t,100)$ and $(-50+3t,-100).$ The equation of the line connecting these points and the equation of the circle are\\begin{align}y&=-\\frac{100}{t}x+200-\\frac{5000}{t}\\\\50^2&=x^2+y^2\\end{align}.When they see each other again, the line connecting the two points will be tangent to the circle at the point $(x,y).$ Since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent we get\\[-\\frac{x}{y}=-\\frac{100}{t}\\]or $xt=100y.$ Now substitute\\[y= \\frac{xt}{100}\\]into $(2)$ and get\\[x=\\frac{5000}{\\sqrt{100^2+t^2}}.\\]Now substitute this and\\[y=\\frac{xt}{100}\\]into $(1)$ and solve for $t$ to get\\[t=\\frac{160}{3}.\\]Finally, the sum of the numerator and denominator is $160+3=\\boxed{163}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The midpoints of the sides of a triangle with area $T$ are joined to form a triangle with area $M$. What is the ratio of $M$ to $T$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n When you connect the midpoints of two sides of a triangle, you get a segment which is half as long as the third side of the triangle. Therefore, every side in the smaller triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}$ the side length of the original triangle. Therefore, the area of the smaller triangle is $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$ the area of the larger triangle.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An equilateral triangle has sides 8 units long. An equilateral triangle with sides 4 units long is cut off at the top, leaving an isosceles trapezoid. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the trapezoid? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect the midpoints of the sides of the equilateral triangle as shown.  The triangle is divided into four congruent equilateral triangles, and the isosceles trapezoid is made up of 3 of these 4 triangles.  Therefore, the ratio of the area of one of the triangles to the area of the trapezoid is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(12mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=3;\n\ndraw((0,0)--dir(0)--2*dir(0)--dir(60)+(1,0)--dir(60)--cycle);\n\ndraw(dir(60)+(1,0)--dir(0)--dir(60)--2*dir(60)--cycle);\n\ndot((0,0));\ndot(2*dir(0));\ndot(2*dir(60));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is inscribed in a circle of radius 3.  What is the area of the triangle? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$.  The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.  Thus $5x=2\\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$.  The area of the triangle is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3x\\cdot 4x =\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{18}{5}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}\n=\\frac{216}{25}=\\boxed{8.64}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The diagonals of a regular hexagon have two possible lengths. What is the ratio of the shorter length to the longer length? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two possible diagonal lengths are $AB$ and $AC$.  The measure of an interior angle of a regular hexagon is $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees. Therefore, angle $BCA$ measures $120/2=60$ degrees.  Also, the base angles of the isosceles triangle with the marked 120-degree angle each measure $(180-120)/2=30$ degrees. This implies that $\\angle CBA$ is a right angle, so triangle $ABC$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.  Therefore, the ratio of $AB$ to $AC$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.
