Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ has vertices $A$ and $C$ at $(0,0)$ and $(7,1)$, respectively. What is its area?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Diagonals $\\overline{AC}$, $\\overline{CE}$, $\\overline{EA}$, $\\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{CF}$, and $\\overline{EB}$ divide the hexagon into twelve congruent 30-60-90 triangles, six of which make up equilateral $\\triangle ACE$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G;\n\nA = (0,0);\nC = (7,1);\nE = rotate(60)*(C);\nG = (A + C + E)/3;\nB = 2*G - E;\nD = 2*G - A;\nF = 2*G - C;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--cycle);\ndraw((-2,0)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,-2)--(0,8));\ndraw(A--C--E--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, S);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, dir(0));\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, N);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, W);\n[/asy]\n\nBecause $AC=\\sqrt{7^2+1^2}=\\sqrt{50}$, the area of $\\triangle ACE$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\displaystyle\\left(\\sqrt{50}\\displaystyle\\right)^2=\\frac{25}{2}\\sqrt{3}$. The area of hexagon $ABCDEF$ is $2\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{25}{2}\\sqrt{3}\\displaystyle\\right)=\\boxed{25\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nAn alternate way to start: let $O$ be the center of the hexagon.  Then triangles $ABC,CDE,$ and $EFA$ are congruent to triangles $AOC,COE,$ and $EOA$, respectively.  Thus the area of the hexagon is twice the area of equilateral $\\triangle ACE$.  Then proceed as in the first solution.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many different triangles can be formed having a perimeter of 7 units if each side must have integral length?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $a,b,$ and $c$ represent the three side lengths of the triangle. The perimeter is $a+b+c=7,$ so $b+c=7-a$. We know by the Triangle Inequality that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle must be greater than the third side length. If we focus on the variable $a$, we have\n\\[b+c>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 7-a>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 3.5>a.\\]We could easily replace $a$ with $b$ or $c$, so the maximum length of any of the three sides is $3$. If $a=3$, then $b+c=4$ and $b$ and $c$ could be $1$ and $3$ in some order or $2$ and $2$ in some order. If we let $a=2$ or $a=1$ and the maximum side length is $3$, we'll still end up with triangles of side lengths $(1,3,3)$ or $(2,2,3)$. There are $\\boxed{2}$ different triangles.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A hexagon is inscribed in a circle. Five of the sides have length $81$ and the sixth, denoted by $\\overline{AB}$, has length $31$. Find the sum of the lengths of the three diagonals that can be drawn from $A$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]defaultpen(fontsize(9)); pair A=expi(-pi/2-acos(475/486)), B=expi(-pi/2+acos(475/486)), C=expi(-pi/2+acos(475/486)+acos(7/18)), D=expi(-pi/2+acos(475/486)+2*acos(7/18)), E=expi(-pi/2+acos(475/486)+3*acos(7/18)), F=expi(-pi/2-acos(475/486)-acos(7/18)); draw(unitcircle);draw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);draw(A--C..A--D..A--E); dot(A^^B^^C^^D^^E^^F); label(\"\\(A\\)\",A,(-1,-1));label(\"\\(B\\)\",B,(1,-1));label(\"\\(C\\)\",C,(1,0)); label(\"\\(D\\)\",D,(1,1));label(\"\\(E\\)\",E,(-1,1));label(\"\\(F\\)\",F,(-1,0)); label(\"31\",A/2+B/2,(0.7,1));label(\"81\",B/2+C/2,(0.45,-0.2)); label(\"81\",C/2+D/2,(-1,-1));label(\"81\",D/2+E/2,(0,-1)); label(\"81\",E/2+F/2,(1,-1));label(\"81\",F/2+A/2,(1,1)); label(\"\\(x\\)\",A/2+C/2,(-1,1));label(\"\\(y\\)\",A/2+D/2,(1,-1.5)); label(\"\\(z\\)\",A/2+E/2,(1,0)); [/asy]\nLet $x=AC=BF$, $y=AD=BE$, and $z=AE=BD$.\nPtolemy's Theorem on $ABCD$ gives $81y+31\\cdot 81=xz$, and Ptolemy on $ACDF$ gives $x\\cdot z+81^2=y^2$. Subtracting these equations give $y^2-81y-112\\cdot 81=0$, and from this $y=144$. Ptolemy on $ADEF$ gives $81y+81^2=z^2$, and from this $z=135$. Finally, plugging back into the first equation gives $x=105$, so $x+y+z=105+144+135=\\boxed{384}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A hexagon is obtained by joining, in order, the points $(0,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(2,2)$, $(2,1)$, $(3,1)$, $(2,0)$, and $(0,1)$. The perimeter of the hexagon can be written in the form $a+b\\sqrt{2}+c\\sqrt{5}$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are whole numbers.  Find $a+b+c$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We must find the length of each side of the hexagon to find the perimeter.\n\nWe can see that the distance between each pair of points $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 2)$, $(2, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$, and $(2, 1)$ and $(3, 1)$ is 1. Thus, these three sides have a total length of 3.\n\nWe can see that the distance between $(0, 1)$ and $(1, 2)$ is $\\sqrt 2$. The distance between $(3, 1)$ and $(2, 0)$ is also $\\sqrt 2$. These two sides have a total length of $2\\sqrt 2$.\n\nWe can see that the distance between $(2, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$ is $\\sqrt 5$. Thus, the last side has length of $\\sqrt 5$.\n\nSumming all of these distances, we find that the perimeter is ${3 + 2\\sqrt 2 + 1\\sqrt 5}$, so $a+b+c=\\boxed{6}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If a triangle has two sides of lengths 5 and 7 units, then how many different integer lengths can the third side be?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $n$ be the length of the third side.  Then by the triangle inequality, \\begin{align*}\nn + 5 &> 7, \\\\\nn + 7 &> 5, \\\\\n5 + 7 &> n,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $n > 2$, $n > -2$, and $n < 12$.  Hence, the possible values of $n$ are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, for a total of $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The diagonals of a regular hexagon have two possible lengths. What is the ratio of the shorter length to the longer length? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two possible diagonal lengths are $AB$ and $AC$.  The measure of an interior angle of a regular hexagon is $180(6-2)/6=120$ degrees. Therefore, angle $BCA$ measures $120/2=60$ degrees.  Also, the base angles of the isosceles triangle with the marked 120-degree angle each measure $(180-120)/2=30$ degrees. This implies that $\\angle CBA$ is a right angle, so triangle $ABC$ is a 30-60-90 triangle.  Therefore, the ratio of $AB$ to $AC$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.

Then the perimeter of the polygon is $28s = 56$, so $s = 2$.  Hence, the area of the polygon is $25s^2 = \\boxed{100}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A hexagon inscribed in a circle has three consecutive sides, each of length 3, and three consecutive sides, each of length 5. The chord of the circle that divides the hexagon into two trapezoids, one with three sides, each of length 3, and the other with three sides, each of length 5, has length equal to $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In hexagon $ABCDEF$, let $AB=BC=CD=3$ and let $DE=EF=FA=5$. Since arc $BAF$ is one third of the circumference of the circle, it follows that $\\angle BCF = \\angle BEF=60^{\\circ}$. Similarly, $\\angle CBE =\\angle CFE=60^{\\circ}$. Let $P$ be the intersection of $\\overline{BE}$ and $\\overline{CF}$, $Q$ that of $\\overline{BE}$ and $\\overline{AD}$, and $R$ that of $\\overline{CF}$ and $\\overline{AD}$. Triangles $EFP$ and  $BCP$ are equilateral, and by symmetry, triangle $PQR$ is isosceles and thus also equilateral.

Hence triangles $ABQ$ and $EDQ$ are similar. Therefore, $$\\frac{AQ}{EQ}=\\frac{BQ}{DQ}=\\frac{AB}{ED}=\\frac{3}{5}.$$ It follows that $$\\frac{\\frac{AD-PQ}{2}}{PQ+5} =\\frac{3}{5}\\quad\n\\mbox {and}\\quad \\frac{3-PQ}{\\frac{AD+PQ}{2}}=\\frac{3}{5}.$$ Solving the two equations simultaneously  yields $AD=360/49,$ so $m+n=\\boxed{409}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The side length of the regular hexagon is 10 cm.

Thus, $\\triangle ABH$ and $\\triangle CBH$ are congruent $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangles.  These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince $AB=BC=10$, we have $BH = AB/2 = 5$ and $AH = CH = \\sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $BH$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $AC = 2\\cdot 5\\sqrt{3} = 10\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe shaded region is a rectangle with base length $10$ and height length $10\\sqrt{3}$; its area is $10\\cdot 10\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{100\\sqrt{3}}$ square cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measures of the interior angles of a convex hexagon form an increasing arithmetic sequence. How many such sequences are possible if the hexagon is not equiangular and all of the angle degree measures are positive integers less than $150$ degrees?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The number of degrees in a hexagon is $(6-2) \\cdot 180=720$ degrees. Setting the degree of the smallest angle to be $x$, and the increment to be $d$, we get that the sum of all of the degrees is $x+x+d+x+2d+x+3d+x+4d+x+5d=6x+15d=720$. We want $15d$ to be even so that adding it to an even number $6x$ would produce an even number $720$. Therefore, $d$ must be even. The largest angle we can have must be less than $150$, so we try even values for $d$ until we get an angle that's greater or equal to $150$.  Similarly, we can conclude that $x$ must be a multiple of 5.\n\nThe largest angle is $x + 5d.$  We notice that, if we divide both sides of $6x + 15d = 720$ by 3, we get $2x + 5d = 240.$  For $x + 5d < 150,$ we must have $x > 90.$  The largest value of $d$ occurs when $x = 95$ and $5d = 240 - 2x = 240 - 2 \\cdot 95 = 240 - 190 = 50,$ or $d = 10.$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ values for $d$: $2,4,6,8,$ and $10$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths, in order, of four consecutive sides of an equiangular hexagon are 1, 7, 2 and 4 units, respectively.
