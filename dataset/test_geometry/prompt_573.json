    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $C$ has radius 6 cm. How many square centimeters are in the area of the largest possible inscribed triangle having one side as a diameter of circle $C$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We may consider the diameter of circle $C$ as the base of the inscribed triangle; its length is $12\\text{ cm}$. Then the corresponding height extends from some point on the diameter to some point on the circle $C$. The greatest possible height is a radius of $C$, achieved when the triangle is right isosceles: [asy]\nunitsize(8);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),6));\ndraw(((-6,0)--(6,0)));\nlabel(\"$12$\",(0,0),S);\ndraw(((-6,-0.6)--(-0.6,-0.6)),BeginArrow);\ndraw(((0.6,-0.6)--(6,-0.6)),EndArrow);\ndraw(((-6,0)--(0,6)));\ndraw(((0,6)--(6,0)));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,6)),dashed);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(0,2.5),E);\n[/asy] In this case, the height is $6\\text{ cm}$, so the area of the triangle is $$\\frac 12\\cdot 12\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{36}\\text{ square centimeters}.$$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles triangle has side lengths 8 cm, 8 cm and 10 cm.  The longest side of a similar triangle is 25 cm. What is the perimeter of the larger triangle, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the length of the longest sides of the small triangle to the large triangle is $10/25 = 2/5$, which must hold constant for all sides of the two triangles since they are similar.  Thus the perimeters of the two triangles are also in the ratio of $2/5$.  The small triangle has perimeter $8+8+10=26$, so the large triangle has perimeter $\\frac{5}{2}\\cdot 26 = \\boxed{65}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Inside a square with side length 10, two congruent equilateral triangles are drawn such that they share one side and each has one vertex on a vertex of the square.  What is the side length of the largest square that can be inscribed in the space inside the square and outside of the triangles?\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F;\nB=(0,0); A=(0,10); D=(10,10); C=(10,0);\nreal x = 5 -5/sqrt(3);\npair E = (x,x); pair F = (10-x, 10-x);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(A--E--C--F--cycle); draw(E--F);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The largest possible square is the square with one vertex on the triangles' coincident vertices and with sides parallel to and coincident with those of the big square.  There are two of them.  We draw them in and label the diagram as shown: [asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F;\nB=(0,0); A=(0,10); D=(10,10); C=(10,0);\nreal x = 5 -5/sqrt(3);\npair E = (x,x); pair F = (10-x, 10-x);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(A--E--C--F--cycle); draw(B--D,dashed);\npair P=(0,x); pair Q=(x,0); draw(P--E--Q);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\",E,NNE);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,SSW);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,W);\nlabel(\"$Q$\",Q,S);\ndraw((10,10-x)--(10-x,10-x)--(10-x,10));\ndraw(A--C,dashed); label(\"$M$\",(5,5),W);\n[/asy] First, we find the side length of the equilateral triangle.  $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$; let $MF=x$, so $AM=MC=x\\sqrt{3}$ and $AC=2x\\sqrt{3}$. $AC$ is the diagonal of $ABCD$ and thus has length $10\\sqrt{2}$.  So we have \\[2x\\sqrt{3}=10\\sqrt{2}.\\]  It follows that the side length of the triangle is $2x=\\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nNow, look at diagonal $BD$ and notice that it is made up of twice the diagonal of the small square plus the side length of the triangle.  Let the side length of the small square be $y$, so we have  \\[BD=BE+EF+FD=y\\sqrt{2}+\\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}+y\\sqrt{2}=10\\sqrt{2}.\\]   Solving yields $y\\sqrt{2}=5\\sqrt{2}-\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}$ so $y=\\boxed{5-\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Square $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle. Square $EFGH$ has vertices $E$ and $F$ on $\\overline{CD}$ and vertices $G$ and $H$ on the circle. If the area of square $ABCD$ is $1$, then the area of square $EFGH$ can be expressed as $\\frac {m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers and $m < n$. Find $10n + m$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $O$ be the center of the circle, and $2a$ be the side length of $ABCD$, $2b$ be the side length of $EFGH$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, the radius of $\\odot O = OC = a\\sqrt{2}$.\n[asy] size(150); pointpen = black; pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pen d = linetype(\"4 4\") + blue + linewidth(0.7); pair C=(1,1), D=(1,-1), B=(-1,1), A=(-1,-1), E= (1, -0.2), F=(1, 0.2), G=(1.4, 0.2), H=(1.4, -0.2); D(MP(\"A\",A)--MP(\"B\",B,N)--MP(\"C\",C,N)--MP(\"D\",D)--cycle); D(MP(\"E\",E,SW)--MP(\"F\",F,NW)--MP(\"G\",G,NE)--MP(\"H\",H,SE)--cycle); D(CP(D(MP(\"O\",(0,0))), A));  D((0,0) -- (2^.5, 0), d); D((0,0) -- G -- (G.x,0), d);  [/asy]\nNow consider right triangle $OGI$, where $I$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{GH}$. Then, by the Pythagorean Theorem,\n\\begin{align*} OG^2 = 2a^2 &= OI^2 + GI^2 = (a+2b)^2 + b^2 \\\\ 0 &= a^2 - 4ab - 5b^2 = (a - 5b)(a + b) \\end{align*}\nThus $a = 5b$ (since lengths are positive, we discard the other root). The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths, so $\\frac{[EFGH]}{[ABCD]} = \\left(\\frac 15\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{25}$, and the answer is $10n + m = \\boxed{251}$.\nAnother way to proceed from $0 = a^2 - 4ab - 5b^2$ is to note that $\\frac{b}{a}$ is the quantity we need; thus, we divide by $a^2$ to get\n\\[0 = 1 - 4\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) - 5\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right)^2\\]This is a quadratic in $\\frac{b}{a}$, and solving it gives $\\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1}{5},-1$. The negative solution is extraneous, and so the ratio of the areas is $\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{25}$ and the answer is $10\\cdot 25 + 1 = \\boxed{251}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 10$, $BC = 14$, and $CA = 16$. Let $D$ be a point in the interior of $\\overline{BC}$. Let points $I_B$ and $I_C$ denote the incenters of triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$, respectively. The circumcircles of triangles $BI_BD$ and $CI_CD$ meet at distinct points $P$ and $D$. The maximum possible area of $\\triangle BPC$ can be expressed in the form $a - b\\sqrt {c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a + b + c$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, by the Law of Cosines, we have\\[\\cos BAC = \\frac {16^2 + 10^2 - 14^2}{2\\cdot 10 \\cdot 16} = \\frac {256+100-196}{320} = \\frac {1}{2},\\]so $\\angle BAC = 60^\\circ$.\nLet $O_1$ and $O_2$ be the circumcenters of triangles $BI_BD$ and $CI_CD$, respectively. We first compute\\[\\angle BO_1D = \\angle BO_1I_B + \\angle I_BO_1D = 2\\angle BDI_B + 2\\angle I_BBD.\\]Because $\\angle BDI_B$ and $\\angle I_BBD$ are half of $\\angle BDA$ and $\\angle ABD$, respectively, the above expression can be simplified to\\[\\angle BO_1D = \\angle BO_1I_B + \\angle I_BO_1D = 2\\angle BDI_B + 2\\angle I_BBD = \\angle ABD + \\angle BDA.\\]Similarly, $\\angle CO_2D = \\angle ACD + \\angle CDA$. As a result\\begin{align*}\\angle CPB &= \\angle CPD + \\angle BPD \\\\&= \\frac {1}{2} \\cdot \\angle CO_2D + \\frac {1}{2} \\cdot \\angle BO_1D \\\\&= \\frac {1}{2}(\\angle ABD + \\angle BDA + \\angle ACD + \\angle CDA) \\\\&= \\frac {1}{2} (2 \\cdot 180^\\circ - \\angle BAC) \\\\&= \\frac {1}{2} \\cdot 300^\\circ = 150^\\circ.\\end{align*}\nTherefore $\\angle CPB$ is constant ($150^\\circ$). Also, $P$ is $B$ or $C$ when $D$ is $B$ or $C$. Let point $L$ be on the same side of $\\overline{BC}$ as $A$ with $LC = LB = BC = 14$; $P$ is on the circle with $L$ as the center and $\\overline{LC}$ as the radius, which is $14$. The shortest distance from $L$ to $\\overline{BC}$ is $7\\sqrt {3}$.\nWhen the area of $\\triangle BPC$ is the maximum, the distance from $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$ has to be the greatest. In this case, it's $14 - 7\\sqrt {3}$. The maximum area of $\\triangle BPC$ is\\[\\frac {1}{2} \\cdot 14 \\cdot (14 - 7\\sqrt {3}) = 98 - 49 \\sqrt {3}\\]and the requested answer is $98 + 49 + 3 = \\boxed{150}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two sides of a triangle measure 4 cm and 9 cm. What is the greatest integer number of centimeters that could be the third side of this triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Using the Triangle Inequality, we see that the third side must be smaller than the sum of the first two sides, or 13 cm. That means the greatest integer number of centimeters for the third side is $\\boxed{12}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the diameter of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 11,$ $AC=6,$ and $BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $d$ be the diameter of the inscribed circle, and let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=12$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{12\\cdot 1\\cdot 6\\cdot 5} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{6^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 12,$$which yields the radius $r=\\frac {\\sqrt{10}}{2}$. This yields the diameter $d = \\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a triangle, the area is numerically equal to the perimeter. What is the radius of the inscribed circle?\n$\\text{(A) } 2\\quad \\text{(B) } 3\\quad \\text{(C) } 4\\quad \\text{(D) } 5\\quad \\text{(E) } 6$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n One of the most common formulas involving the inradius of a triangle is $A = rs$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle, $r$ is the inradius, and $s$ is the semiperimeter.\nThe problem states that $A = p = 2s$. This means $2s = rs$, or $r = \\boxed{2}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $\\triangle ABC$ has a right angle at $C$, $\\angle A = 60^\\circ$, and $AC=10$.  Find the radius of the incircle of $\\triangle ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We begin by drawing a diagram:\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\npair A,B,C;\nreal x = sqrt(3);\nC=(0,0); A=(10,0); B=(0,10*x);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(rightanglemark(B,C,A,30));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SE); label(\"$C$\",C,SW); label(\"$B$\",B,NW); label(\"10\",(A+C)/2,S);\n\nreal r = 5*sqrt(3) - 5;\ndraw(Circle((r,r),r));\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle A = 60^\\circ$, we have $\\angle B = 180^\\circ - 90^\\circ - 60^\\circ = 30^\\circ$.  Then $\\triangle ABC$ is a $30 - 60 - 90$ triangle, so $BC=AC\\sqrt{3}=10\\sqrt{3}$ and $AB=2AC=20$.  We can compute the area of $\\triangle ABC$ as \\[ [\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{1}{2}(AC)(BC)=\\frac{1}{2}(10)(10\\sqrt{3}) = 50\\sqrt{3}.\\]Let the incircle of $\\triangle ABC$ have radius $r$.  A triangle with inradius $r$ and semiperimeter $s$ has \\[\\text{area} = rs,\\]so we have  \\[ [\\triangle ABC] = r \\left( \\frac{10+10\\sqrt{3}+20}{2} \\right) = r(15+5\\sqrt{3}).\\]Setting these two area expressions equal gives \\[50\\sqrt{3}=r(15+5\\sqrt{3}).\\]Solving for $r$ gives  \\[r = \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}(3-\\sqrt{3})}{9-3} = \\boxed{5(\\sqrt{3}-1)}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is inscribed  in a square, then a square is inscribed  in this circle, and finally, a circle is inscribed  in this square. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger square?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the radius of the smaller circle be $r$. Then the side length of the smaller square is $2r$. The radius of the larger circle is half the length of the diagonal of the smaller square, so it is $\\sqrt{2}r$. Hence the larger square has sides of length $2\\sqrt{2}r$. The ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger square is therefore \\[\n\\frac{\\pi r^2}{\\left(2\\sqrt{2}r\\right)^2} =\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{8}}.\n\\]\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),14.1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,14.1)--(14.1,0)--(0,-14.1)--(-14.1,0)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-14.1,14.1)--(14.1,14.1)--(14.1,-14.1)--(-14.1,-14.1)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(-14.1,0),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-7.1,7.1)--(0,0),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{2}r$\",(-6,0),S);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-3.5,3.5),NE);\nlabel(\"$2r$\",(-7.1,7.1),W);\nlabel(\"$2\\sqrt{2}r$\",(0,14.1),N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $C$ has radius 10 cm.
