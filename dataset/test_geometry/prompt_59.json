    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is three times as long as a second  side, and the length of the third side is 15. What is the greatest possible perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $x$, $3x$, and 15. The Triangle Inequality implies that $3x<x+15$, so $x<7.5$. Because $x$ is an integer, the greatest possible perimeter is $7+21+15=\\boxed{43}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many units are in the sum of the lengths of the two longest altitudes in a triangle with sides $8,$ $15,$ and $17$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We recognize 8, 15, and 17 as a Pythagorean triple. Since the hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse is the shortest of the altitudes. The other two altitudes are just the legs themselves, therefore $8 + 15 = \\boxed{23}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 33 units and 42 units. The third side also has an integral length. What is the least possible number of units in the perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The sum of the smaller two sides must exceed the greatest side, so if $x$ is the missing side then $x+33>42\\implies x>9$.  The smallest integer greater than 9 is 10, so the least perimeter is $10+33+42=\\boxed{85}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of the three sides of a triangle are $7$, $x+4$ and $2x+1$.  The perimeter of the triangle is 36.  What is the length of the longest side of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the perimeter of the triangle is 36, then $7+(x+4)+(2x+1)=36$ or $3x+12=36$ or $3x=24$ or $x=8$.\n\nThus, the lengths of the three sides of the triangle are $7$, $8+4=12$ and $2(8)+1=17$, of which the longest is $\\boxed{17}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many non-congruent triangles with only integer side lengths have a perimeter of 15 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In a triangle, the lengths of any two sides must add up to a value larger than the third length's side.  This is known as the Triangle Inequality.  Keeping this in mind, we list out cases based on the length of the shortest side.\n\nCase 1:  shortest side has length $1$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $7$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{1,7,7\\}$.\n\nCase 2:  shortest side has length $2$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $6$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{2,6,7\\}$.\n\nCase 3:  shortest side has length $3$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $6$ and $6$ or $5$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{3,6,6\\}$ and $\\{3,5,7\\}$.\n\nCase 4:  shortest side has length $4$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $5$ and $6$ or $4$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{4,5,6\\}$ and $\\{4,4,7\\}$.\n\nCase 5:  shortest side has length $5$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $5$ and $5$.  This leads to the set $\\{5,5,5\\}$.\n\nHence there are $\\boxed{7}$ sets of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of $15$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $B$ is on $\\overline{AC}$ with $AB = 9$ and $BC = 21.$ Point $D$ is not on $\\overline{AC}$ so that $AD = CD,$ and $AD$ and $BD$ are integers. Let $s$ be the sum of all possible perimeters of $\\triangle ACD$. Find $s.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] size(220); pointpen = black; pathpen = black + linewidth(0.7); pair O=(0,0),A=(-15,0),B=(-6,0),C=(15,0),D=(0,8); D(D(MP(\"A\",A))--D(MP(\"C\",C))--D(MP(\"D\",D,NE))--cycle); D(D(MP(\"B\",B))--D); D((0,-4)--(0,12),linetype(\"4 4\")+linewidth(0.7)); MP(\"6\",B/2); MP(\"15\",C/2); MP(\"9\",(A+B)/2); [/asy]\nDenote the height of $\\triangle ACD$ as $h$, $x = AD = CD$, and $y = BD$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find that $h^2 = y^2 - 6^2$ and $h^2 = x^2 - 15^2$. Thus, $y^2 - 36 = x^2 - 225 \\Longrightarrow x^2 - y^2 = 189$. The LHS is difference of squares, so $(x + y)(x - y) = 189$. As both $x,\\ y$ are integers, $x+y,\\ x-y$ must be integral divisors of $189$.\nThe pairs of divisors of $189$ are $(1,189)\\ (3,63)\\ (7,27)\\ (9,21)$. This yields the four potential sets for $(x,y)$ as $(95,94)\\ (33,30)\\ (17,10)\\ (15,6)$. The last is not a possibility since it simply degenerates into a line. The sum of the three possible perimeters of $\\triangle ACD$ is equal to $3(AC) + 2(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) = 90 + 2(95 + 33 + 17) = \\boxed{380}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of an equilateral triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. What is the perimeter of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$. This must equal $s$. Setting the two equal and solving, we get \\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\\\\n4s&=s^2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4 &= s\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4\\sqrt{3}&= 3s \\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} &=s\n\\end{align*} Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is $3s=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}} \\text{units}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, we have that $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of sides $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{AB}$, respectively. The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is 24 square units. How many square units are in the area of $\\triangle CEF$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We first draw a diagram: [asy]\npair A, B, C, E, F;\nA = (0, 4);\nB = (-3, 0);\nC = (7, 0);\nE = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * C;\nF = 0.5 * A + 0.5 * B;\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--E--F--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\n[/asy] Since $F$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, the area of $\\triangle AFC$ is half of the area of $\\triangle ABC,$ or 12 square units. Following the same reasoning, we see that $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AC},$ so the area of $\\triangle CEF$ is half that of $\\triangle AFC,$ or $\\boxed{6}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An octagon is inscribed in a square so that the vertices of the octagon trisect the sides of the square. The perimeter of the square is 108 centimeters. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the octagon?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each side of the square has length $27$. Each trisected segment therefore has length $9$. We can form the octagon by taking away four triangles, each of which has area $\\frac{(9)(9)}{2}$, for a total of $(2)(9)(9) = 162$. The total area of the square is $27^2=729$, so the area of the octagon is $729-162=\\boxed{567}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has three different integer side lengths and a perimeter of 20 units. What is the maximum length of any one side?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A triangle with sides of 9,8 and 3 will satisfy these conditions.  This will have longest side of 9.  If the longest side has length 10, then the sum of the remaining two sides $x+y$ must be greater than 10 by the triangle inequality.  However, this cannot be since this will equal 10, and thus, the maximum length of one side is $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle with sides $3a-1$, $a^2 + 1$ and $a^2 + 2$ has a perimeter of 16 units. What is the number of square units in the area of the triangle?\n\nAnswer:\n",
