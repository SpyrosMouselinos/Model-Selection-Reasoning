    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $B$ has its center at $(-6, 2)$ and a radius of $10$ units. What is the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the two points on circle $B$ that are also on the $y$-axis?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that if the $y$-coordinate of one of the two points is $2+c$, then the $y$-coordinate of the other point must be $2-c$ because the two points must be equidistant from the line $y=2$. Therefore, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the two points on circle $B$ that are also on the $y$-axis is $\\boxed{4}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are points on a circle, and segments $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{BD}$ intersect at $P$, such that $AP=8$, $PC=1$, and $BD=6$. Find $BP$, given that $BP < DP.$\n\n[asy]\n\nunitsize(0.6 inch);\n\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));\ndraw((-0.3,0.94)--(0.3,-0.94));\ndraw((-0.7,-0.7)--(0.7,-0.7));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-0.3,0.94),NW);\ndot((-0.3,0.94));\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0.7,-0.7),SE);\ndot((0.7,-0.7));\nlabel(\"$C$\",(0.3,-0.94),SSE);\ndot((0.3,-0.94));\nlabel(\"$D$\",(-0.7,-0.7),SW);\ndot((-0.7,-0.7));\ndot((0.23,-0.7));\nlabel(\"$P$\",(0.23,-0.7),NE);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Writing $BP=x$ and $PD=6-x$, we have that $BP < 3$. Power of a point at $P$ gives $AP \\cdot PC = BP \\cdot PD$ or $8=x(6-x)$. This can be solved for $x=2$ and $x=4$, and we discard the latter, leaving $BP = \\boxed{2}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be points on a circle such that $AB = 11$ and $CD = 19.$ Point $P$ is on segment $AB$ with $AP = 6$, and $Q$ is on segment $CD$ with $CQ = 7$. The line through $P$ and $Q$ intersects the circle at $X$ and $Y$. If $PQ = 27$, find $XY$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First of all, suppose $X, P, Q, Y$ lie in that order. We make a sketch (diagram not to scale!): [asy]\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\npair A,B,C,D,X,Y;\nA=dir(100)*(20,0);\nB=dir(40)*(20,0);\nC=dir(200)*(20,0);\nD=dir(320)*(20,0);\nX=dir(80)*(20,0);\nY=dir(280)*(20,0);\ndraw(circle((0,0),20));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(X--Y);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,SE);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,N);\nlabel(\"$Y$\",Y,S);\nlabel(\"$P$\",(1,15));\nlabel(\"$Q$\",(5.5,-8.5));\n[/asy] Let $PX = x$ and $QY = y$. By power of a point from $P$, $x\\cdot(27+y) = 30$, and by power of a point from $Q$, $y\\cdot(27+x) = 84$. Subtracting the first from the second, $27\\cdot(y-x) = 54$, so $y = x+2$. Now, $x\\cdot(29+x) = 30$, and we find $x = 1, -30$. Since $-30$ makes no sense, we take $x = 1$ and obtain $XY = 1 + 27 + 3 = \\boxed{31}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Three congruent isosceles triangles $DAO$, $AOB$ and $OBC$ have $AD=AO=OB=BC=10$ and $AB=DO=OC=12$.  These triangles are arranged to form trapezoid $ABCD$, as shown.  Point $P$ is on side $AB$ so that $OP$ is perpendicular to $AB$.\n\n[asy]\npair A, B, C, D, O, P;\nA= (6, 8);\nB=(18, 8);\nC=(24, 0);\nD=(0,0);\nO=(12,0);\nP=(12,8);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--A);\ndraw(A--O--B);\ndraw(O--P, dashed);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, S);\nlabel(\"P\", P, N);\nlabel(\"12\", (D+O)/2, S);\nlabel(\"12\", (O+C)/2, S);\nlabel(\"10\", (A+D)/2, NW);\nlabel(\"10\", (B+C)/2, NE);\n[/asy]\n\nPoint $X$ is the midpoint of $AD$ and point $Y$ is the midpoint of $BC$.  When $X$ and $Y$ are joined, the trapezoid is divided into two smaller trapezoids.  The ratio of the area of trapezoid $ABYX$ to the area of trapezoid $XYCD$ in simplified form is $p:q$. Find $p+q$. [asy]\npair A, B, C, D, O, P, X, Y;\nA= (6, 8);\nB=(18, 8);\nC=(24, 0);\nD=(0,0);\nO=(12,0);\nP=(12,8);\nX=(A+D)/2;\nY=(B+C)/2;\ndraw(X--Y, dashed);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--A);\ndraw(A--O--B);\ndraw(O--P, dashed);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, S);\nlabel(\"P\", P, N);\nlabel(\"X\", X, NW);\nlabel(\"Y\", Y, NE);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $\\triangle AOB$ is isosceles with $AO=OB$ and $OP$ is perpendicular to $AB$, point $P$ is the midpoint of $AB$, so $AP=PB=\\frac{1}{2}AB=\\frac{1}{2}(12)=6$.  By the Pythagorean Theorem, $OP = \\sqrt{AO^2 - AP^2}=\\sqrt{10^2-6^2}=\\sqrt{64}={8}$.\n\nSince $ABCD$ is a trapezoid with height of length 8 ($OP$ is the height of $ABCD$) and parallel sides ($AB$ and $DC$) of length $12$ and $24$, its area is \\[ \\frac{1}{2}\\times\\,\\mbox{Height}\\,\\times\\,\\mbox{Sum of parallel sides} = \\frac{1}{2}(8)(12+24)=\\boxed{144}. \\]\n\nSince $XY$ cuts $AD$ and $BC$ each in half, then it also cuts the height $PO$ in half.\nThus, each of the two smaller trapezoids has height 4.  Next, we find the length of $XY$.  The sum of the areas of trapezoids $ABYX$ and $XYCD$ must equal that of trapezoid $ABCD$.  Therefore, \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{2}(4)(AB+XY)+\\frac{1}{2}(4)(XY+DC)&=144\\\\\n2(12+XY)+2(XY+24) & = 144\\\\\n4(XY)& = 72 \\\\\nXY & = 18\n\\end{align*} Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABYX$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(4)(12+18)=60$ and the area of trapezoid $XYCD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(4)(18+24)=84$.\nThus, the ratio of their areas is $60:84=5:7$.\nOur answer is then $5+7=\\boxed{12}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $A$ has coordinates $(x,6)$. When Point $A$ is reflected over the $y$-axis it lands on Point $B$. What is the sum of the four coordinate values of points $A$ and $B$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The coordinates of point $B$ are $(-x,6)$.  The sum of all four coordinates is $x+6+(-x)+6=\\boxed{12}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The image of the point with coordinates $(1,1)$ under the reflection across the line $y=mx+b$ is the point with coordinates $(9,5)$.  Find $m+b$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection.  The slope of the segment is $\\frac{5-1}{9-1}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Since the line of reflection is perpendicular, its slope, $m$, equals $-2$.  By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment are $\\left(\\frac{9+1}2,\\frac{5+1}2\\right)=(5,3)$.   Since the line of reflection goes through this point, we have $3=(-2)(5)+b$, and so $b=13$.  Thus $m+b=-2+13=\\boxed{11}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $A, B, C, D,$ and $E$ are collinear in that order such that $AB = BC = 1, CD = 2,$ and $DE = 9$. If $P$ can be any point in space, what is the smallest possible value of $AP^2 + BP^2 + CP^2 + DP^2 + EP^2$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the altitude from $P$ onto $AE$ at $Q$ have lengths $PQ = h$ and $AQ = r$. It is clear that, for a given $r$ value, $AP$, $BP$, $CP$, $DP$, and $EP$ are all minimized when $h = 0$. So $P$ is on $AE$, and therefore, $P = Q$. Thus, $AP$=r, $BP = |r - 1|$, $CP = |r - 2|$, $DP = |r - 4|$, and $EP = |r - 13|.$ Squaring each of these gives:\n$AP^2 + BP^2 + CP^2 + DP^2 + EP^2 = r^2 + (r - 1)^2 + (r - 2)^2 + (r - 4)^2 + (r - 13)^2 = 5r^2 - 40r + 190$\nThis reaches its minimum at $r = \\frac {40}{2\\cdot 5} = 4$, at which point the sum of the squares of the distances is $\\boxed{110}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $R = (8,6)$. The lines whose equations are $8y = 15x$ and $10y = 3x$ contain points $P$ and $Q$, respectively, such that $R$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{PQ}$. The length of $PQ$ equals $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] pointpen = black; pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair R = (8,6), P = (32,60)/7, Q= (80,24)/7; D((0,0)--MP(\"x\",(13,0),E),EndArrow(6)); D((0,0)--MP(\"y\",(0,10),N),EndArrow(6)); D((0,0)--(10/(15/8),10),EndArrow(6)); D((0,0)--(13,13 * 3/10),EndArrow(6)); D(D(MP(\"P\",P,NW))--D(MP(\"Q\",Q),SE),linetype(\"4 4\")); D(MP(\"R\",R,NE)); [/asy]\nThe coordinates of $P$ can be written as $\\left(a, \\frac{15a}8\\right)$ and the coordinates of point $Q$ can be written as $\\left(b,\\frac{3b}{10}\\right)$. By the midpoint formula, we have $\\frac{a+b}2=8$ and $\\frac{15a}{16}+\\frac{3b}{20}=6$. Solving for $b$ gives $b= \\frac{80}{7}$, so the point $Q$ is $\\left(\\frac{80}7, \\frac{24}7\\right)$. The answer is twice the distance from $Q$ to $(8,6)$, which by the distance formula is $\\frac{60}{7}$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{67}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The endpoints of a diameter of circle $M$ are $(-1,-4)$ and $(-7,6)$. What are the coordinates of the center of circle $M$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The midpoint of a diameter of a circle is its center. Thus, $M$ is the midpoint of the segment from $(-1,-4)$ to $(-7,6),$ so $M$ has coordinates \\[\\left(\\frac{-1+(-7)}{2},\\frac{-4+6}{2} \\right)=\\boxed{(-4,1)}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Determine the coordinates of the point $P$ on the line $y=-x+6$ such that $P$ is equidistant from the points $A(10,-10)$ and $O(0,0)$ (that is, so that $PA=PO$).  Express your answer as an ordered pair $(a,b)$.\n\nAnswer:\n",
