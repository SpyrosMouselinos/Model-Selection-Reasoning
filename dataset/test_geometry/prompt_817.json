    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle ABC$ have side lengths $AB=13$, $AC=14$, and $BC=15$.  There are two circles located inside $\\angle BAC$ which are tangent to rays $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{AC}$, and segment $\\overline{BC}$.  Compute the distance between the centers of these two circles.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two circles described in the problem are shown in the diagram.  The circle located inside $\\triangle ABC$ is called the incircle; following convention we will label its center $I$.  The other circle is known as an excircle, and we label its center $E$.  To begin, we may compute the area of triangle $ABC$ using Heron's formula.  The side lengths of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ are $a=15$, $b=14$, and $c=13$, while the semiperimeter is $s=\\frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)=21$, so its area is \\[ K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{21\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdot 8} = 84. \\]We find the inradius $r$ of $\\triangle ABC$ by using the fact that $K=rs$, so $84=21r$, giving $r=4$.  Next label the points of tangency of the incircle and excircle with ray $\\overline{AC}$ as $S$ and $T$, as shown at right.  It is a standard fact that $AS=s-a=6$ and $AT=s=21$. (The reader should confirm this.  Repeatedly use the fact that tangents from a point to a circle have the same length.)  Furthermore, the angle bisector of $\\angle A$ passes through $I$ and $E$, and the radii $\\overline{SI}$ and $\\overline{TE}$ are perpendicular to $\\overline{AC}$, so triangles $\\triangle ASI$ and $\\triangle ATE$ are similar right triangles.  By the Pythagorean Theorem we compute \\[ AI = \\sqrt{(AS)^2+(SI)^2} = \\sqrt{36+16}=2\\sqrt{13}. \\]Using the similar triangles we find that $AI/AE = AS/AT = 6/21 = 2/7$.  Therefore $AE=7\\sqrt{13}$ and we conclude that $IE=AE-AI=\\boxed{5\\sqrt{13}}$.\n\n[asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\ndraw((0,0)--(4,0)--(3,5)--cycle);\ndraw(incircle((0,0),(4,0),(3,5)));\nreal x = 1.15;\npair A = (0,0) + x*(-3,-5);\npair B = (4,0) + x*(1,-5);\ndraw(A--(3,5)--B--cycle);\ndraw(incircle(A,(3,5),B));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(3,5),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(4,0),E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(0,0),W);\npair I = incenter((0,0),(3,5),(4,0));\npair iFoot = foot(I,(0,0),(3,5));\nlabel(\"$S$\",iFoot,W);\nlabel(\"$I$\",I,E);\ndraw(iFoot--I);\npair I2 = incenter(A,(3,5),B);\npair iFoot2 = foot(I2,(0,0),(3,5));\nlabel(\"$T$\",iFoot2,W);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I2,S);\ndraw(iFoot2--I2);\ndraw((3,5)--(I2));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 22, AC=12,$ and $BC=14$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=24$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24\\cdot 2\\cdot 12\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 24\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$24\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 24,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The sides of triangle $PQR$ are tangent to a circle with center $C$ as shown. Given that $\\angle PQR = 65^\\circ$ and $\\angle QRC = 30^\\circ$, find $\\angle QPR$, in degrees.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1.0 cm);\n\npair Q, P, R, C;\n\nQ = (2.43,3.46);\nP = (0,0);\nR = (4.43,0);\nC = incenter(Q,P,R);\n\ndraw(Q--P--R--cycle);\ndraw(incircle(Q,P,R));\ndraw(R--C);\n\nlabel(\"$Q$\", Q, N);\nlabel(\"$P$\", P, SW);\nlabel(\"$R$\", R, SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, N);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The circle with center $C$ is the incircle of $\\triangle PQR$. So, any segment from a vertex of the triangle to $C$ is an angle bisector.\n\nFrom $\\angle QRC = 30^\\circ$, we find that $\\angle QRP = 60^\\circ$ because $RC$ is an angle bisector.\n\nThe sum of the measures of the internal angles of a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\angle QPR &= 180^\\circ - \\angle PQR - \\angle QRP \\\\\n&= 180^\\circ - 65^\\circ - 60^\\circ.\n\\end{align*}This yields $\\angle QPR = \\boxed{55^\\circ}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is inscribed in quadrilateral $ABCD$, tangent to $\\overline{AB}$ at $P$ and to $\\overline{CD}$ at $Q$. Given that $AP=19$, $PB=26$, $CQ=37$, and $QD=23$, find the square of the radius of the circle.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Call the center of the circle $O$. By drawing the lines from $O$ tangent to the sides and from $O$ to the vertices of the quadrilateral, four pairs of congruent right triangles are formed.\nThus, $\\angle{AOP}+\\angle{POB}+\\angle{COQ}+\\angle{QOD}=180$, or $(\\arctan(\\tfrac{19}{r})+\\arctan(\\tfrac{26}{r}))+(\\arctan(\\tfrac{37}{r})+\\arctan(\\tfrac{23}{r}))=180$.\nTake the $\\tan$ of both sides and use the identity for $\\tan(A+B)$ to get\\[\\tan(\\arctan(\\tfrac{19}{r})+\\arctan(\\tfrac{26}{r}))+\\tan(\\arctan(\\tfrac{37}{r})+\\arctan(\\tfrac{23}{r}))=n\\cdot0=0.\\]\nUse the identity for $\\tan(A+B)$ again to get\\[\\frac{\\tfrac{45}{r}}{1-19\\cdot\\tfrac{26}{r^2}}+\\frac{\\tfrac{60}{r}}{1-37\\cdot\\tfrac{23}{r^2}}=0.\\]\nSolving gives $r^2=\\boxed{647}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the ratio of the area of a square inscribed in a semicircle with radius $r$ to the area of a square inscribed in a circle with radius $r$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $s_1$ be the side length of the square inscribed in the semicircle of radius $r$.  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle shown in the diagram, we have $(s_1/2)^2+s_1^2=r^2$, which implies $s_1^2=\\frac{4}{5}r^2$.  Let $s_2$ be the side length of the square inscribed in the circle of radius $r$.  Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle shown in the diagram, we have $(s_2/2)^2+(s_2/2)^2=r^2$, which implies $s_2^2=2r^2$.  Therefore, the ratio of  the areas of the two squares is $\\dfrac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}=\\dfrac{\\frac{4}{5}r^2}{2r^2}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{2}{5}}$.

Using the formula $A = rs$ on $\\triangle PQR$, where $r_{1}$ is the inradius (similarly define $r_2, r_3$ to be the radii of $C_2, C_3$), $s = \\frac{PQ + QR + RP}{2} = 180$ is the semiperimeter, and $A = \\frac 12 bh = 5400$ is the area, we find $r_{1} = \\frac As = 30$. Or, the inradius could be directly by using the formula $\\frac{a+b-c}{2}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the legs of the right triangle and $c$ is the hypotenuse. (This formula should be used only for right triangles.) Thus $ST, UV$ lie respectively on the lines $y = 60, x = 60$, and so $RS = 60, UQ = 30$.\nNote that $\\triangle PQR \\sim \\triangle STR \\sim \\triangle UQV$. Since the ratio of corresponding lengths of similar figures are the same, we have\n\\[\\frac{r_{1}}{PR} = \\frac{r_{2}}{RS} \\Longrightarrow r_{2} = 15\\ \\text{and} \\ \\frac{r_{1}}{PQ} = \\frac{r_{3}}{UQ} \\Longrightarrow r_{3} = 10.\\]\nLet the centers of $\\odot C_2, C_3$ be $O_2 = (0 + r_{2}, 60 + r_{2}) = (15, 75), O_3 = (60 + r_{3}, 0 + r_{3}) = (70,10)$, respectively; then by the distance formula we have $O_2O_3 = \\sqrt{55^2 + 65^2} = \\sqrt{10 \\cdot 725}$. Therefore, the answer is $n = \\boxed{725}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two concentric circles are centered at point P. The sides of a 45 degree angle at P form an arc on the smaller circle that is the same length as an arc on the larger circle formed by the sides of a 36  degree angle at P. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger circle? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be the circumferences of the smaller and larger circle, respectively.  The length of the $45^\\circ$ arc on the smaller circle is $\\left(\\frac{45^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\right)C_1$, and the length of the $36^\\circ$ arc on the larger circle is $\\left(\\frac{36^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\right)C_2$.  Setting these two lengths equal we find \\[\n\\frac{C_1}{C_2}=\\frac{36}{45}=\\frac{4}{5}.\n\\]The ratio of the areas of the two circles is the square of the ratio of their circumferences: \\[\n\\frac{\\pi r_1^2}{\\pi r_2^2}=\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{2\\pi r_1}{2\\pi r_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{C_1}{C_2}\\right)^2=\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^2=\\boxed{\\frac{16}{25}}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle with a radius of 2 units has its center at $(0, 0)$.
