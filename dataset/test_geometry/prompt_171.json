    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many different isosceles triangles have integer side lengths and perimeter 23?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because the perimeter of such a triangle is 23, and the sum of the two equal side lengths is even, the length of the base is odd. Also, the length of the base is less than the sum of the other two side lengths, so it is less than half of 23. Thus the $\\boxed{6}$ possible triangles have side lengths 1, 11, 11; 3, 10, 10; 5, 9, 9; 7, 8, 8; 9, 7, 7 and 11, 6, 6.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has three different integer side lengths and a perimeter of 20 units. What is the maximum length of any one side?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A triangle with sides of 9,8 and 3 will satisfy these conditions.  This will have longest side of 9.  If the longest side has length 10, then the sum of the remaining two sides $x+y$ must be greater than 10 by the triangle inequality.  However, this cannot be since this will equal 10, and thus, the maximum length of one side is $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many non-congruent triangles with only integer side lengths have a perimeter of 15 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In a triangle, the lengths of any two sides must add up to a value larger than the third length's side.  This is known as the Triangle Inequality.  Keeping this in mind, we list out cases based on the length of the shortest side.\n\nCase 1:  shortest side has length $1$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $7$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{1,7,7\\}$.\n\nCase 2:  shortest side has length $2$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $6$ and $7$.  This leads to the set $\\{2,6,7\\}$.\n\nCase 3:  shortest side has length $3$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $6$ and $6$ or $5$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{3,6,6\\}$ and $\\{3,5,7\\}$.\n\nCase 4:  shortest side has length $4$.  Then the other two sides can have lengths $5$ and $6$ or $4$ and $7$.  This leads to the sets $\\{4,5,6\\}$ and $\\{4,4,7\\}$.\n\nCase 5:  shortest side has length $5$.  Then the other two sides must have lengths $5$ and $5$.  This leads to the set $\\{5,5,5\\}$.\n\nHence there are $\\boxed{7}$ sets of non-congruent triangles with a perimeter of $15$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two sides of an isosceles triangle are 10 inches and 20 inches. If the shortest side of a similar triangle is 50 inches, what is the perimeter of the larger triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First of all, the third side of the smaller triangle cannot be 10 inches because sides of 10, 10 and 20 inches would not form a triangle. The smaller triangle must have sides of 10, 20 and 20 inches. If the shortest side of the similar triangle is 50 inches, then the other two sides are 100 inches and 100 inches. Thus, the perimeter of the larger triangle is $50 + 100 + 100 = \\boxed{250\\text{ inches}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many different triangles can be formed having a perimeter of 7 units if each side must have integral length?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $a,b,$ and $c$ represent the three side lengths of the triangle. The perimeter is $a+b+c=7,$ so $b+c=7-a$. We know by the Triangle Inequality that the sum of two side lengths of a triangle must be greater than the third side length. If we focus on the variable $a$, we have\n\\[b+c>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 7-a>a\\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad 3.5>a.\\]We could easily replace $a$ with $b$ or $c$, so the maximum length of any of the three sides is $3$. If $a=3$, then $b+c=4$ and $b$ and $c$ could be $1$ and $3$ in some order or $2$ and $2$ in some order. If we let $a=2$ or $a=1$ and the maximum side length is $3$, we'll still end up with triangles of side lengths $(1,3,3)$ or $(2,2,3)$. There are $\\boxed{2}$ different triangles.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the smallest possible perimeter, in units, of a triangle whose side-length measures are consecutive integer values?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The smallest such triangle has lengths 1, 2, and 3. However, this triangle doesn't work since the sum of any two side lengths must be greater than the third side length (by the Triangle Inequality). The next smallest triangle has lengths 2, 3, and 4, which works. Thus, the smallest possible perimeter is $2+3+4=\\boxed{9}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the minimum number of equilateral triangles, of side length 1 unit, needed to cover an equilateral triangle of side length 10 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the sides of the small to big equilateral triangle (note that they are similar) is $1/10$, so the ratio of their areas is $(1/10)^2 = 1/100$. So the big equilateral triangle has 100 times the area of a small one, so it will take $\\boxed{100}$ small triangles to cover the big one.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles triangle has side lengths 8 cm, 8 cm and 10 cm.  The longest side of a similar triangle is 25 cm. What is the perimeter of the larger triangle, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the length of the longest sides of the small triangle to the large triangle is $10/25 = 2/5$, which must hold constant for all sides of the two triangles since they are similar.  Thus the perimeters of the two triangles are also in the ratio of $2/5$.  The small triangle has perimeter $8+8+10=26$, so the large triangle has perimeter $\\frac{5}{2}\\cdot 26 = \\boxed{65}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of two sides of a triangle are 33 units and 42 units. The third side also has an integral length. What is the least possible number of units in the perimeter of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The sum of the smaller two sides must exceed the greatest side, so if $x$ is the missing side then $x+33>42\\implies x>9$.  The smallest integer greater than 9 is 10, so the least perimeter is $10+33+42=\\boxed{85}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many isosceles triangles with whole-number length sides have a perimeter of 20 units?\n\nAnswer:\n",
