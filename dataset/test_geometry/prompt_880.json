    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A fly is on the edge of a ceiling of a circular room with a radius of 58 feet. The fly walks straight across the ceiling to the opposite edge, passing through the center of the circle. It then walks straight to another point on the edge of the circle but not back through the center. The third part of the journey is straight back to the original starting point. If the third part of the journey was 80 feet long, how many total feet did the fly travel over the course of all three parts?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The fly's journey traces out the three sides of triangle.  Because one side of this triangle is a diameter of the circular ceiling and the other two sides are chords of this circle, the triangle is a right triangle. If the radius of the circular room is 58 feet, then the diameter is $2 \\times 58 = 116$ feet. This is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. One of the legs is 80 feet, so the other leg must be equal to $\\sqrt{116^2 - 80^2} = \\sqrt{(13{,}456 - 6400)} = \\sqrt{7056} = 84$ feet. The total distance traveled by the fly is $116 + 84 + 80 = \\boxed{280}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone has a base with radius $600$ and height $200\\sqrt{7}.$ A fly starts at a point on the surface of the cone whose distance from the vertex of the cone is $125$, and crawls along the surface of the cone to a point on the exact opposite side of the cone whose distance from the vertex is $375\\sqrt{2}.$ Find the least distance that the fly could have crawled.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The easiest way is to unwrap the cone into a circular sector. Center the sector at the origin with one radius on the positive $x$-axis and the angle $\\theta$ going counterclockwise. The circumference of the base is $C=1200\\pi$. The sector's radius (cone's sweep) is $R=\\sqrt{r^2+h^2}=\\sqrt{600^2+(200\\sqrt{7})^2}=\\sqrt{360000+280000}=\\sqrt{640000}=800$. Setting $\\theta R=C\\implies 800\\theta=1200\\pi\\implies\\theta=\\frac{3\\pi}{2}$.\nIf the starting point $A$ is on the positive $x$-axis at $(125,0)$ then we can take the end point $B$ on $\\theta$'s bisector at $\\frac{3\\pi}{4}$ radians along the $y=-x$ line in the second quadrant. Using the distance from the vertex puts $B$ at $(-375,375)$. Thus the shortest distance for the fly to travel is along segment $AB$ in the sector, which gives a distance $\\sqrt{(-375-125)^2+(375-0)^2}=125\\sqrt{4^2+3^2}=\\boxed{625}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Six boys stood equally spaced on a circle of radius 40 feet. Each boy walked to all of the other non-adjacent persons on the circle, shook their hands and then returned to his original spot on the circle before the next boy started his trip to shake hands with all of the other non-adjacent boys on the circle. After all six boys had done this, what is the least distance in feet that could have been traveled? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The thicker solid line in the diagram shows the shortest path that one person could travel. The circle is equally divided into six 60-degree arcs, so the short distance is 40 feet, the same as a radius. The dotted line is a diameter that separates the quadrilateral into two 30-60-90 triangles. The longer leg is $(80\\sqrt {3})/2$, or $40\\sqrt{3}$ feet. Each person travels $40\\sqrt{3} + 40 + 40 + 40\\sqrt{3} = 80 + 80\\sqrt{3}$ feet. After all six people did this, $6(80 + 80\\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{480 + 480\\sqrt{3}\\text{ feet}}$ had been traveled.

The string evenly loops around the post exactly four full times, starting at the bottom edge and finishing at the top edge. The height of the post is 12 feet. What is the length, in feet, of the string?\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,20)..(1,19.5)..(2,20)--(2,0)..(1,-.5)..(0,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,20)..(1,20.5)..(2,20),linewidth(1));\ndraw((1,19.5)--(0,18.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((2,.5)--(1,-.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((2,16)--(0,14),linewidth(1));\ndraw((2,11)--(0,9),linewidth(1));\n\ndraw((2,6)--(0,4),linewidth(1));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each time the string spirals around the post, it travels 3 feet up and 4 feet around the post.  If we were to unroll this path, it would look like: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,3)--(4,3)--(4,0)--cycle, linewidth(.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(4,3),linewidth(.7));\nlabel(\"3\",(0,1.5),W);\nlabel(\"4\",(2,3),N);\n[/asy] Clearly, a 3-4-5 right triangle has been formed.  For each time around the post, the string has length 5.  So, the total length of the string will be $4\\cdot 5=\\boxed{20}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Jenny and Kenny are walking in the same direction, Kenny at 3 feet per second and Jenny at 1 foot per second, on parallel paths that are 200 feet apart. A tall circular building 100 feet in diameter is centered midway between the paths. At the instant when the building first blocks the line of sight between Jenny and Kenny, they are 200 feet apart. Let $t\\,$ be the amount of time, in seconds, before Jenny and Kenny can see each other again. If $t\\,$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Consider the unit cicle of radius 50. Assume that they start at points $(-50,100)$ and $(-50,-100).$ Then at time $t$, they end up at points $(-50+t,100)$ and $(-50+3t,-100).$ The equation of the line connecting these points and the equation of the circle are\\begin{align}y&=-\\frac{100}{t}x+200-\\frac{5000}{t}\\\\50^2&=x^2+y^2\\end{align}.When they see each other again, the line connecting the two points will be tangent to the circle at the point $(x,y).$ Since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent we get\\[-\\frac{x}{y}=-\\frac{100}{t}\\]or $xt=100y.$ Now substitute\\[y= \\frac{xt}{100}\\]into $(2)$ and get\\[x=\\frac{5000}{\\sqrt{100^2+t^2}}.\\]Now substitute this and\\[y=\\frac{xt}{100}\\]into $(1)$ and solve for $t$ to get\\[t=\\frac{160}{3}.\\]Finally, the sum of the numerator and denominator is $160+3=\\boxed{163}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A spiral staircase turns $270^\\circ$ as it rises 10 feet.  The radius of the staircase is 3 feet.  What is the number of feet in the length of the handrail?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The handrail encases a right circular cylinder with radius 3 feet and height 10 feet.  Its lateral area is a rectangle with height 10 feet and width equal to its base circumference, or $2\\pi\\cdot 3 = 6\\pi$ feet.  A staircase that turns $360^\\circ$ would, when unrolled and lain flat, span the diagonal of this rectangle.  However, our staircase does not make a full turn, so it spans a rectangle with a shorter width.\n\nA $270^\\circ$ sector of a circle with radius 3 has arc length $\\frac{270^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\cdot 2\\pi\\cdot 3 = 4.5\\pi$.  Thus, when unrolled and lain flat, our handrail spans the diagonal of a rectangle with height 10 feet and width $4.5\\pi$ feet.  Our handrail has length $\\sqrt{10^2+(4.5\\pi)^2} \\approx 17.317$ feet.  To the nearest tenth, this value is $\\boxed{17.3}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the height of Jack's house, in feet, if the house casts a shadow 56 feet long at the same time a 21-foot tree casts a shadow that is 24 feet long? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of shadow lengths is $\\frac{56}{24}=\\frac{7}{3}$.\n\nThis is the same as the ratio of actual heights, so if $h$ is the height of the house,\n\n$$\\frac{h}{21}=\\frac{7}{3}\\Rightarrow h=\\boxed{49}$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A unicorn is tethered by a $20$-foot silver rope to the base of a magician's cylindrical tower whose radius is $8$ feet. The rope is attached to the tower at ground level and to the unicorn at a height of $4$ feet. The unicorn has pulled the rope taut, the end of the rope is $4$ feet from the nearest point on the tower, and the length of the rope that is touching the tower is $\\frac{a-\\sqrt{b}}c$ feet, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, and $c$ is prime.

Starting at a corner, Alice walks along the perimeter of the park for a distance of $5$ km. How many kilometers is she from her starting point?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\sqrt{13}\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ \\sqrt{14}\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ \\sqrt{15}\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ \\sqrt{16}\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\sqrt{17}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We imagine this problem on a coordinate plane and let Alice's starting position be the origin. We see that she will travel along two edges and then go halfway along a third. Therefore, her new $x$-coordinate will be $1 + 2 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2}$ because she travels along a distance of $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 1$ km because of the side relationships of an equilateral triangle, then $2$ km because the line is parallel to the $x$-axis, and the remaining distance is $\\frac{1}{2}$ km because she went halfway along and because of the logic for the first part of her route. For her $y$-coordinate, we can use similar logic to find that the coordinate is $\\sqrt{3} + 0 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} =  \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, her distance is\\[\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{49}{4} + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{52}{4}} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A can is in the shape of a right circular cylinder.

The length of the rectangle is the circumference of the base, $12$ inches in this case, and the width of the rectangle is the height of the cylinder, $5$ inches. The spiral strip goes from one corner of the rectangular lateral area to the other, so it is also the hypotenuse of a right triangle. We find the length of the hypotenuse with the Pythagorean Theorem, or we recognize that $5$ and $12$ are part of the Pythagorean triple $(5, 12, 13)$, so the length of the hypotenuse (the spiral strip) is $\\boxed{13}$ inches.\n\n[asy]\npair A=(0,0), B=(12,0), C=(12,5), D=(0,5);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(A--C);\nlabel(\"$12$\", A--B, S);\nlabel(\"$5$\", B--C,E);\nlabel(\"$13$\", A--C, NW);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,15));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A gecko is in a room that is 12 feet long, 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall.
