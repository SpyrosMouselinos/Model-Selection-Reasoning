    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measure of each exterior angle of a regular polygon is $30$ degrees. What is the sum of the measures of the interior angles, in degrees?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Taking one exterior angle per vertex, the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$. If each exterior angle is $30^\\circ$, then the polygon has $\\frac{360}{30}=12$ sides. The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$, so for a polygon with 12 sides, the sum of the interior angles is $180(12-2)=\\boxed{1800}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measures of angles $A$ and $B$ are both positive, integer numbers of degrees. The measure of angle $A$ is a multiple of the measure of angle $B$, and angles $A$ and $B$ are complementary angles. How many measures are possible for angle $A$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The given information tells us that $A = 90^\\circ -B$ and $A=kB$ for some $k\\ge1$.  Therefore, we have $kB = 90^\\circ - B$. This simplifies to $(k+1)B=90^\\circ$. $k+1$ can be any factor of $90$ except one, since $k+1\\ge2$. $90=2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$ has $2\\cdot3\\cdot2=12$ factors, so there are 11 possible values of $k$. Each value of $k$ uniquely determines the value of $B$ and therefore the value of $A$, so there are $\\boxed{11}$ possible measures for $A$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with angle $B$ congruent to angle $C$. The measure of angle $C$ is four times the measure of angle $A$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $B$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $x$ be the number of degrees in $\\angle A$. Then $\\angle C=4x^\\circ$, and $\\angle B$ is also $4x^\\circ$ (since $\\angle B$ is congruent to $\\angle C$).\n\nSince the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we have $$x + 4x + 4x = 180,$$ which we can solve for $x=20$. Therefore, $\\angle B = 4\\cdot 20 = \\boxed{80}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AX = XY = YB = BC$ and the measure of angle $ABC$ is 120 degrees. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$?\n\n[asy]\npair A,X,Y,B,C;\nX = A + dir(30); Y = X + dir(0); B = Y + dir(60); C = B + dir(-30);\ndraw(B--Y--X--B--C--A--X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$X$\",X,NW); label(\"$Y$\",Y,S); label(\"$B$\",B,N); label(\"$C$\",C,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $t$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$ (which is what we want to compute).\n\nSince $AX=XY$, we have $\\angle AYX = \\angle YAX = \\angle BAC = t^\\circ$. Then, since the sum of angles in $\\triangle AXY$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle AXY = (180-2t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AXY$ and $\\angle BXY$ add to form a straight angle, so they are supplementary; $\\angle BXY = (180-(180-2t))^\\circ = (2t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $XY=YB$, we have $\\angle XBY = \\angle BXY = (2t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle XYB$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle XYB = (180-4t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AYX$, $\\angle XYB$, and $\\angle BYC$ add to form a straight angle, so their sum is $180^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle BYC = (180-t-(180-4t))^\\circ = (3t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $YB=BC$, we have $\\angle YCB = \\angle BYC = (3t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle YBC$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle YBC = (180-6t)^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, $\\angle ABC = \\angle XBY + \\angle YBC = (2t)^\\circ + (180-6t)^\\circ = (180-4t)^\\circ$. We know this is equal to $120^\\circ$, so we solve the equation $$180-4t = 120$$ to obtain $t=\\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the figure, $m\\angle A = 28^{\\circ}$, $m\\angle B = 74^\\circ$ and $m\\angle C = 26^{\\circ}$. If $x$ and $y$ are the measures of the angles in which they are shown, what is the value of $x + y$?

By vertical angles, this makes the rightmost angle in the triangle containing angle $y$ also equal to 64 degrees.  Thus, the third angle in that triangle has measure $180-(y+64)=116-y$ degrees.  Now, we can turn our attention to the five sided figure that contains angles $A$, $B$, and $x$.  By vertical angles the right most angle will be $116-y$ degrees.  The angle with exterior measure of $x$ degrees will have an interior measure of $360-x$ degrees.  Finally, the sum of the angles in a five sided polygon will be equal to $(5-2)180=540$ degrees.  So, we can write $$A+B+360-x+90+116-y=540$$ $$28+74+360-x+90+116-y=540$$ $$\\boxed{128}=x+y$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Polygon $ABCDEF$ is a regular hexagon. What is the measure in degrees of angle $ABF$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In triangle $ABF$, the two acute angles are equal since $AB=AF$. Also, the measure of $\\angle A$ is $180^\\circ(6-2)/6=120^\\circ$.  Letting $x$ be the measure of $\\angle ABF$, we have \\[\n120^\\circ+x+x=180^\\circ \\implies x=\\boxed{30}\\text{ degrees}.\n\\] [asy]\nsize(5cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nint i;\npair A=dir(0), B=dir(60), C=dir(120), D=dir(180), Ep=dir(240), F=dir(300);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D,Ep,F};\nstring[] alphabet={\"$A$\",\"$B$\",\"$C$\",\"$D$\",\"$E$\",\"$F$\"};\ndot(dots);\nfor(i=0;i<6;++i)\n{\n\ndraw(dir(60*i)--dir(60*i+60));\n\nlabel(alphabet[i],dots[i],dots[i]);\n}\ndraw(A--B--F);\ndraw(anglemark(F,B,A));\ndraw(anglemark(A,F,B));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ are isosceles with $AB=BC$ and $AD=DC$. Point $D$ is inside $\\triangle ABC$, $\\angle ABC = 40^\\circ$, and $\\angle ADC = 140^\\circ$.  What is the degree measure of $\\angle\nBAD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, \\[\n\\angle BAC=\\frac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\left( 180^{\\circ}-\\angle ABC\\displaystyle\\right)=70^{\\circ}.\n\\] [asy]\npair A,B,C,D;\nA=(-5,0); B=(0,21); C=(5,0); D=(0,6);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw(A--D--C--cycle,linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$140^{\\circ}$\",(0,4),S);\nlabel(\"$40^{\\circ}$\",(0,15),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\n[/asy] Similarly, \\[\n\\angle DAC=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( 180^{\\circ}-\\angle\nADC\\right)=20^{\\circ}.\n\\]  Thus \\[\\angle BAD = \\angle BAC - \\angle DAC\n= \\boxed{50^{\\circ}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, the angle bisectors are $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$, which intersect at the incenter $I$.  If $\\angle ACB = 38^\\circ$, then find the measure of $\\angle AIE$, in degrees.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $AD$ is an angle bisector, $\\angle BAI = \\angle BAC/2$.  Since $BE$ is an angle bisector, $\\angle ABI = \\angle ABC/2$.  As an angle that is external to triangle $ABI$, $\\angle AIE = \\angle BAI + \\angle ABI = \\angle BAC/2 + \\angle ABC/2$.\n\n[asy]\nimport geometry;\n\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, I;\n\nA = (2,12);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (14,0);\nI = incenter(A,B,C);\nD = extension(A,I,B,C);\nE = extension(B,I,C,A);\nF = extension(C,I,A,B);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"$I$\", I, NNE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle ACB = 38^\\circ$, \\[\\angle AIE = \\frac{\\angle BAC + \\angle ABC}{2} = \\frac{180^\\circ - \\angle ACB}{2} = \\frac{180^\\circ - 38^\\circ}{2} = \\boxed{71^\\circ}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with angle $A$ congruent to angle $B$. The measure of angle $C$ is 30 degrees more than the measure of angle $A$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $C$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $x$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $A$.  Then angle $B$ measures $x$ degrees as well and angle $C$ measures $x+30$ degrees.  Since the sum of the interior angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we solve $x+x+x+30=180$ to find $x=50$.  Therefore, angle $C$ measures $x+30=50+30=\\boxed{80}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles, obtuse triangle has one angle with a degree measure that is 50$\\%$ larger than the measure of a right angle.
