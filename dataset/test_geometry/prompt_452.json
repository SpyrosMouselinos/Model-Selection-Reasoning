    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$ the lengths of the bases $AB$ and $CD$ are 8 and 17 respectively. The legs of the trapezoid are extended beyond $A$ and $B$ to meet at point $E$. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $EAB$ to the area of trapezoid $ABCD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\npair A,B,C,D,F;\nA = (0,0);\nB = (8,0);\nD = (-4,7);\nC = (13,7);\nF = intersectionpoint(D -- (A + 3*(A-D)), C -- (B + 3*(B-C)));\ndraw(A--F--C--D--A--B);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$E$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,NE);\n[/asy]\n\nTriangles $EAB$ and $EDC$ are similar, and the ratio of their corresponding sides is $\\frac{CD}{AB} = \\frac{17}{8}$. Therefore, we have \\[\\frac{[EDC]}{[EAB]} = \\left(\\frac{17}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{289}{64}.\\]  Since $[EDC] = [EAB] + [ABCD]$, we have $\\frac{[ABCD] + [EAB]}{[EAB]} = \\frac{289}{64}$, so \\[\\frac{[ABCD]}{[EAB]} + 1 = \\frac{289}{64}.\\] Therefore, $\\frac{[ABCD]}{[EAB]} = \\frac{225}{64}$, so $\\frac{[EAB]}{[ABCD]} = \\boxed{\\frac{64}{225}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles trapezoid has legs of length 30 cm each, two diagonals of length 40 cm each and the longer base is 50 cm. What is the trapezoid's area in sq cm?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can pick a diagonal and a leg of the trapezoid such that, along with the longer base, these lines form a triangle with sides of length 30, 40, and 50. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the triangle is a right triangle. It follows that the altitude to the longer base of the trapezoid is $30\\cdot 40/50 = 24$. This altitude is the same length as the height of the trapezoid.\n\nWe now look at the right triangle formed by this altitude, the adjacent leg of the trapezoid, and part of the longer base. These three sides form a right triangle, with hypotenuse of 30 and one leg (the altitude) of length 24. It follows that the other leg has length 18.\n\nBecause this is an isosceles trapezoid, we can now calculate the shorter base to have length $50 - 2\\cdot 18 = 14$. Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is $\\dfrac{(50 + 14)(24)}{2} = \\boxed{768}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles trapezoid is circumscribed around a circle. The longer base of the trapezoid is $16$, and one of the base angles is $\\arcsin(.8)$. Find the area of the trapezoid.\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 72\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 75\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 80\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 90\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{not uniquely determined}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the trapezium have diagonal legs of length $x$ and a shorter base of length $y$. Drop altitudes from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base to form two right-angled triangles, which are congruent since the trapezium is isosceles. Thus using the base angle of $\\arcsin(0.8)$ gives the vertical side of these triangles as $0.8x$ and the horizontal side as $0.6x$. Now notice that the sides of the trapezium can be seen as being made up of tangents to the circle, and thus using the fact that \"the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length\" gives $2y + 0.6x + 0.6x = 2x$. Also, using the given length of the longer base tells us that $y + 0.6x + 0.6x = 16$. Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x=10$ and $y=4$, so the height of the trapezium is $0.8 \\times 10 = 8$. Thus the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(4+16)(8) = \\boxed{80}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system, trapezoid $ABCD$ has vertices $A(1, -2)$, $B(1, 1)$, $C(5, 7)$ and $D(5, 1)$. What is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two bases of the trapezoids are the segments $AB$ and $CD$, and the height is the perpendicular distance between the bases, which in this case is the difference of the $x$-coordinates: $5 - 1 = 4$. Similarly, the lengths of the bases are the differences of the $y$-coordinates of their two endpoints. Using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1+ b_2)h$, the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(3+6)(4) = \\boxed{18}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Trapezoid $ABCD$ has base $AB = 20$ units and base $CD = 30$ units. Diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $X$. If the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $300$ square units, what is the area of triangle $BXC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The formula for the area of a trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2}h\\times(b_1+b_2)$, with $h$ being the height, $b_1$ being the shorter base, and $b_2$ being the longer base.  We can find the height of this particular trapezoid with algebra: \\begin{align*}\n300&=\\frac{1}{2}h\\times(20+30)\\\\\n600&=h\\times50\\\\\nh&=12\n\\end{align*}Now that we know the height of the trapezoid, we can find the area of triangle $ADC$, whose base is $30$ (the longer base of the trapezoid), and whose height is $12$.  Therefore, the area of triangle $ADC=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot30\\times12=180$.  We can use this information to find that the area of triangle $ABC$, or the upper portion of the trapezoid, is $300-180=120$. Now we need to separate the area of $BXC$ from $AXB$, knowing that $ABC=120$. Because trapezoid $ABCD$ is not necessarily an isosceles trapezoid, nothing can be assumed about the diagonals, except that they will cut each other, and the height, in the same ratio as the bases, or $2:3$.  The height of the trapezoid, $12$ units, is therefore divided into the heights of triangles $DXC$ and $AXB$.  We can find these heights with the equation, letting $x$ be the height of triangle $DXC$: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot x+x&=12\\\\\nx\\left(\\frac{2}{3}+1\\right)&=12\\\\\n\\frac{5}{3}x&=12\\\\\nx&=7.2\n\\end{align*}So, the height of triangle $AXB$ is $\\frac{2}{3}\\times7.2=4.8$.  We know that $AB$, the base of $AXB$, is $20$ units, so the area of $AXB=\\frac{1}{2}(20)\\times4.8=48$.  Therefore, the area of triangle $BXC=120-48=\\boxed{72}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$, the parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths of 8 and 20 units, respectively, and the altitude is 12 units. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. What is the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ in square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$. Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $AB$ parallel to $CD$, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. If the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, what is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(2.5inch);\npair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (-3,4);\nB = (5,4);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (0,0);\nE = intersectionpoint(A--C, B--D);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$E$\", E, N);\n[/asy] We will write the area of triangle $XYZ$ as $[XYZ].$  Since triangles $ADC$ and $BCD$ share a base and have the same altitude length to that base, they have the same area. Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$. Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$. Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \\boxed{98}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An equilateral triangle has sides 8 units long. An equilateral triangle with sides 4 units long is cut off at the top, leaving an isosceles trapezoid. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the trapezoid? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect the midpoints of the sides of the equilateral triangle as shown.  The triangle is divided into four congruent equilateral triangles, and the isosceles trapezoid is made up of 3 of these 4 triangles.  Therefore, the ratio of the area of one of the triangles to the area of the trapezoid is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(12mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=3;\n\ndraw((0,0)--dir(0)--2*dir(0)--dir(60)+(1,0)--dir(60)--cycle);\n\ndraw(dir(60)+(1,0)--dir(0)--dir(60)--2*dir(60)--cycle);\n\ndot((0,0));\ndot(2*dir(0));\ndot(2*dir(60));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of square units in the area of trapezoid ABCD with vertices A(0,0), B(0,-2), C(4,0), and D(4,6)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plot the plots and observe that the bases of the trapezoid are $AB$ and $CD$.
