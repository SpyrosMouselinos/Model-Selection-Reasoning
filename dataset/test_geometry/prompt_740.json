    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A dump truck delivered sand to a construction site. The sand formed a conical pile with a diameter of $8$ feet and a height that was $75\\%$ of the diameter. How many cubic feet of sand were in the pile? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The height of the cone is $\\frac{3}{4} \\times 8 = 6$. The radius of the cone is $\\frac{8}{2} = 4$. Therefore, the volume of the cone formed is $\\frac{4^2 \\times 6 \\times \\pi}{3} = \\boxed{32 \\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Brad has a cylindrical barrel with radius 10 inches and height 15 inches.  He wants to fill it from a well, using a bucket in the shape of a hemisphere with a radius of 10 inches. How many trips must Brad make to the well in order to fill the barrel?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We start by finding the volume of the bucket and the volume of the barrel.  Let $r$ be ten inches.   The bucket is half of a sphere of radius $r$, so the volume it can hold is \\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi r^3 . \\]On the other hand, the barrel is a cylinder of radius $r$ and height $15 \\text{ in} = \\frac{3}{2} r$, so its volume is \\[ \\pi r^2 \\cdot \\text{height} = \\frac{3}{2} \\pi r^3 . \\]Therefore the ratio of the volume of the barrel to the volume of the bucket is \\[ \\frac{(3/2) \\pi r^3}{(2/3) \\pi r^3} = \\frac{9}{4}\n= 2 + \\frac{1}{4} . \\]Thus two buckets will not suffice to fill the barrel, but three will, so Brad needs $\\boxed{3}$ trips to the well.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A whole block of modeling clay is a right rectangular prism six inches by two inches by one inch. How many whole blocks need to be unwrapped to mold a cylindrical sculpture seven inches high and four inches in diameter?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylindrical sculpture has radius two inches and uses $\\pi(2^2)(7)=28\\pi \\approx 87.96$ cubic inches of modeling clay.  Each block contains $(6)(2)(1)=12$ cubic inches of modeling clay.  If we have 7 blocks, then we have 84 cubic inches of clay which is not enough, so we need $\\boxed{8}$ blocks of clay, and we see 96 cubic inches are indeed enough.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two cylindrical cans have the same volume. The height of one can is triple the height of the other. If the radius of the narrower can is 12 units, how many units are in the length of the radius of the wider can? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the wide can be $h$ and the height of the narrow can be $3h$.  Let the wide can have radius $x$ units.  Since the two volumes are equal, we have \\[\\pi (12^2) (3h) = \\pi (x^2) (h).\\] Solving yields $x = 12\\sqrt{3}$ so the wide can has radius $\\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A $5 \\times 8$ rectangle can be rolled to form two different cylinders with different maximum volumes. What is the ratio of the larger volume to the smaller volume? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Holding the rectangle vertically, we can form a cylinder with height 8 and base circumference of 5.  Let this cylinder have volume $V_A$ and radius $r_A$; we have $2\\pi r_A = 5$ so $r_A = \\frac{5}{2\\pi}$ and $V_A = \\pi r_A ^2 h = \\pi \\left(\\frac{5}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 (8) = \\frac{50}{\\pi}$.\n\nHolding the rectangle horizontally, we can form a cylinder with height 5 and base circumference of 8.  Similarly, let this cylinder have volume $V_B$ and radius $r_B$; we have $2\\pi r_B = 8$ so $r_B = \\frac{4}{\\pi}$ and $V_B = \\pi r_B^2 h = \\pi \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^2 (5) = \\frac{80}{\\pi}$.\n\nHence, the ratio of the larger volume to the smaller volume is $\\frac{80/\\pi}{50/\\pi}=\\boxed{\\frac{8}{5}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cylinders each have radius 8 inches and height 3 inches. The radius of one cylinder and the height of the other are both increased by the same nonzero number of inches. The resulting volumes are equal. How many inches is the increase? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the increase measure $x$ inches.  The cylinder with increased radius now has volume  \\[\\pi (8+x)^2 (3)\\] and the cylinder with increased height now has volume \\[\\pi (8^2) (3+x).\\] Setting these two quantities equal and solving yields  \\[3(64+16x+x^2)=64(3+x) \\Rightarrow 3x^2-16x=x(3x-16)=0\\] so $x=0$ or $x=16/3$.  The latter is the valid solution, so the increase measures $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Tony will paint 16 right, cylindrical columns. The top face and bottom face of each column will be covered, so those parts will  not be painted.  Each column is 18 feet tall and has a diameter  of 10 feet. One gallon of paint will cover 350 square feet. If paint is sold only in full gallons, how many gallons of paint must Tony buy to paint all 16 columns?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since each column has a radius of 5 feet and height of 18 feet, the lateral surface area of each column is $2 \\pi (5) \\cdot 18 = 180 \\pi$ square feet. Thus, the lateral surface area of 16 columns is $180\\pi\\cdot16\\approx9043$ square feet. Since each gallon of paint covers 350 square feet, and since $9043/350\\approx25.8$, we need $\\boxed{26}$ gallons of paint.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Jimmy owns a cube-shaped container that measures $10$ inches on each side. He fills this container with water until it is half full. Then he throws ten giant ice cubes that measure $2$ inches on each side into the container. In inches cubed, how much of the container is unoccupied by ice or water?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First let's compute the volume of the container. The container measures $10\\times10\\times10$ so its volume is  $$10\\cdot10\\cdot10=10^3=1000$$inches cubed. Since the container is only half full, there are $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot10^3=500$$inches cubed of water in it. Additionally, there are ten ice cubes each with a volume of $2^3$. This means that the total volume of the ice cubes is $$10\\cdot2^3=10\\cdot8=80.$$Altogether, the water and the ice cubes occupy $500+80=580$ inches cubed. This means that there are $1000-580=\\boxed{420}$ inches cubed of space in the container unoccupied by water and ice.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangular box $P$ is inscribed in a sphere of radius $r$. The surface area of $P$ is 384, and the sum of the lengths of its 12 edges is 112. What is  $r$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the dimensions of $P$ be $x$, $y$, and $z$. The sum of the lengths of the edges of $P$ is $4(x+y+z)$, and the surface area of $P$ is $2xy+2yz+2xz$, so \\[\nx+y+z=28 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad 2xy+2yz+2xz=384.\n\\] Each internal diagonal of $P$ is a diameter of the sphere, so \\begin{align*}\n(2r)^2&=(x^2+y^2+z^2)\\\\\n&=(x+y+z)^2-(2xy+2xz+2yz) \\\\\n&= 28^2-384\\\\& = 400.\n\\end{align*} So $2r = 20$ and  $r=\\boxed{10}$.\n\nNote: There are infinitely many positive solutions of the system $x+y+z=28$, $2xy+2yz+2xz=384$, so there are infinitely many non-congruent boxes meeting the given conditions, but each can be inscribed in a sphere of radius 10.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Sean has 12 cylindrical containers filled with sand, each of which has a radius of 4 centimeters. He wants to transfer his sand into some new cylindrical containers, which are the same height but have a radius of 8 centimeters. How many new containers will Sean need?\n\nAnswer:\n",
