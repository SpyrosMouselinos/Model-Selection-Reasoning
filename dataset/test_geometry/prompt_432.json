    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cylinders each have radius 8 inches and height 3 inches. The radius of one cylinder and the height of the other are both increased by the same nonzero number of inches. The resulting volumes are equal. How many inches is the increase? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the increase measure $x$ inches.  The cylinder with increased radius now has volume  \\[\\pi (8+x)^2 (3)\\] and the cylinder with increased height now has volume \\[\\pi (8^2) (3+x).\\] Setting these two quantities equal and solving yields  \\[3(64+16x+x^2)=64(3+x) \\Rightarrow 3x^2-16x=x(3x-16)=0\\] so $x=0$ or $x=16/3$.  The latter is the valid solution, so the increase measures $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A bowling ball is a solid ball with a spherical surface and diameter 30 cm. To custom fit a bowling ball for each bowler, three holes are drilled in the ball. Bowler Kris has holes drilled that are 8 cm deep and have diameters of 2 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm. Assuming the three holes are right circular cylinders, find the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the fitted bowling ball. Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The untampered bowling ball has radius $30/2=15$ cm and volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(15^3)=4\\cdot 15^2\\cdot 5\\pi=225\\cdot 20\\pi = 4500\\pi\\] cubic cm.  The 2 cm cylindrical holes each have radius $2/2=1$ cm and volume \\[\\pi (1^2)(8)=8\\pi\\] cubic cm; the 3 cm cylindrical hole has radius $3/2$ cm and volume \\[\\pi\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2(8)=9\\cdot 2 \\pi = 18\\pi\\] cubic cm.  Post hole-removal the fitted ball has volume \\[4500\\pi - 2\\cdot 8\\pi - 18\\pi = \\boxed{4466\\pi}\\] cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A bowling ball cannot weigh more than 16 pounds and must have a diameter of $8 \\frac{1}{2}$ inches. How many square inches are in the surface area of a bowling ball before the finger holes are drilled? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is \\[4\\pi r^2.\\]  The sphere in question has diameter $8\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{17}{2}$, radius $\\frac{17}{4}$, and surface area  \\[4\\pi\\left(\\frac{17}{4}\\right)^2 = \\frac{17^2}{4}\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{289\\pi}{4}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The diameter, in inches, of a sphere with twice the volume of a sphere of radius 9 inches can be expressed in the form $a\\sqrt[3]{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and $b$ contains no perfect cube factors.  Compute $a+b$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius 9 inches has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=4\\cdot 9^2 \\cdot 3\\pi$ cubic inches; twice this is $8\\cdot 9^2\\cdot 3 \\pi$ cubic inches.  Let the radius of the larger sphere be $r$, so we have \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3= 8\\cdot 9^2\\cdot 3\\pi .\\] Solving for $r$ yields \\[r^3 =2\\cdot 9^3 \\Rightarrow r = 9\\sqrt[3]{2}.\\]  The diameter is twice this value, or $18\\sqrt[3]{2}$ inches.  Hence $a=18$, $b=2$, and $a+b=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A jar of peanut butter which is 3 inches in diameter and 4 inches high sells for $\\$$0.60. At the same rate, what would be the price for a jar that is 6 inches in diameter and 6 inches high?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The first jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{3}{2})^24=9\\pi$. The second jar has a volume of $V=\\pi r^2h=\\pi(\\frac{6}{2})^26=54\\pi$. Note that the volume of the second jar is 6 times greater than that of the first jar. Because peanut butter is sold by volume, the second jar will be six times more expensive than the first jar, for an answer of $\\$0.60\\times6=\\boxed{\\$3.60}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A hemisphere-shaped bowl with radius 1 foot is filled full with chocolate.  All of the chocolate is then evenly distributed between 27 congruent, smaller hemisphere-shaped molds.  What is the radius of each of the smaller molds, in feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so a hemisphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$.  The large hemisphere-shaped bowl has volume $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi(1^3) = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ cubic feet.\n\nLet each of the smaller hemisphere-shaped molds have radius $r$.  Their total volume, in terms of $r$, is $27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3$ cubic feet, so we have \\[27\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi.\\]Dividing both sides by $\\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ yields $27r^3 =1$, so $r=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{27}}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The same amount of steel used to create eight solid steel balls, each with a radius of 1 inch, is used to create one larger steel ball. What is the radius of the larger ball?\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\nfilldraw(circle((0,0),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((.9,-.8),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((1.8,.9),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((2,0),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((2,-.4),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((3,-.4),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((4.8,-.4),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((3.2,.5),1),gray);\n\ndraw((6,.7)--(8,.7),Arrow);\n\nfilldraw(circle((11,.2),2),gray);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The amount of steel used to create one ball with radius 1 is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(1^3)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$; the amount of steel used to create eight of these balls is $8\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi = \\frac{32}{3}\\pi$.\n\nLet the radius of the large steel be $r$.  We have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{32}{3}\\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r^3 = 8 \\Rightarrow r = 2$.  Thus the radius of the large ball is $\\boxed{2}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a given sphere is $36\\pi$ cubic inches. How many square inches are in its surface area? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Here, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=36\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\\pi(3^2)=\\boxed{36\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube with edge length 9 inches. Then a smaller cube is inscribed in the sphere. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed cube? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We draw a diagram:\n\n[asy]\nsize(140);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndot((6,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nThe sphere's diameter length is equal to the big cube's side length, which is 9.\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),9));\ndraw((15,6)..(6,8)..(-3,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((15,6)..(6,4)..(-3,6));\ndot((6,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nNow the sphere's diameter is equal to the space diagonal of the small cube, meaning that the distance between two opposite corners of a cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere.  To compute the space diagonal of the cube, let the side length of the cube be $s$, and label points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ as shown below.\n\n[asy]\nsize(85);\npen dps=linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps);\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,0),SW); label(\"$C$\",(9,0),SE); label(\"$D$\",(12,3),NE); label(\"$A$\",(3,3),NW); label(\"$E$\",(12,12),E);\n[/asy] We look at triangle $\\triangle BDE$, where $\\overline{BE}$ is the space diagonal.  $\\overline{DE}$ is a side length of the cube with length $s$. $\\overline{BD}$ is the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with legs length $s$, so its length is $\\sqrt{s^2+s^2}=s\\sqrt{2}$.  So we have \\[BE=\\sqrt{DE^2+BD^2}=\\sqrt{s^2+(s\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{3s^2} = s\\sqrt{3}.\\]Thus, the space diagonal of a cube with side length $s$ has length $s\\sqrt{3}$.  The sphere has diameter 9, which is equal to the space diagonal of the cube, so we have \\[9 = s\\sqrt{3} \\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad s = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]Finally, the volume of the cube is $s^3 = \\left(\\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{81\\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Alana is making a ball out of rubber bands.
