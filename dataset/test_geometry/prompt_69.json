    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The consecutive angles of a particular trapezoid form an arithmetic sequence.  If the largest angle measures $120^{\\circ}$, what is the measure of the smallest angle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the angles be $a$, $a + d$, $a + 2d$, and $a + 3d$, from smallest to largest. Note that the sum of the measures of the smallest and largest angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the second smallest and second largest angles. This means that the sum of the measures of the smallest and largest angles is equal to half of the total degrees in the trapezoid, or $180^\\circ$. Since the largest angle measures $120^\\circ$, the smallest must measure $180^\\circ - 120^\\circ = \\boxed{60^\\circ}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The degree measures of the angles in a convex 18-sided polygon form an increasing arithmetic sequence with integer values. Find the degree measure of the smallest angle.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The average angle in an 18-gon is $160^\\circ$. In an arithmetic sequence the average is the same as the median, so the middle two terms of the sequence average to $160^\\circ$. Thus for some positive (the sequence is increasing and thus non-constant) integer $d$, the middle two terms are $(160-d)^\\circ$ and $(160+d)^\\circ$. Since the step is $2d$ the last term of the sequence is $(160 + 17d)^\\circ$, which must be less than $180^\\circ$, since the polygon is convex. This gives $17d < 20$, so the only suitable positive integer $d$ is 1. The first term is then $(160-17)^\\circ = \\boxed{143}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In an isosceles triangle, one of the angles opposite an equal side is $40^{\\circ}$. How many degrees are in the measure of the triangle's largest angle? [asy] draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(3,2)--(0,0)); label(\"$\\backslash$\",(1.5,1)); label(\"{/}\",(4.5,1));\nlabel(\"$40^{\\circ}$\",(.5,0),dir(45));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two angles opposite the equal sides of an isosceles triangle are congruent, so in this case, both are $40^\\circ$. Since the three angles of a triangle add up to $180^\\circ$, the third angle in this triangle is $(180-40-40)^\\circ = \\boxed{100}^\\circ$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles, obtuse triangle has one angle with a degree measure that is 50$\\%$ larger than the measure of a right angle. What is the measure, in degrees, of one of the two smallest angles in the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n An angle with measure $50\\%$ larger than the measure of a right angle has measure $\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot 90^{\\circ}=135^{\\circ}$.\n\nThus the other two angles have a combined measure of $45^{\\circ}$. Each one has a measure of\n\n$$\\frac{45^{\\circ}}{2}=\\boxed{22.5^{\\circ}}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$ with $\\overline{BC}\\parallel\\overline{AD}$, let $BC = 1000$ and $AD = 2008$. Let $\\angle A = 37^\\circ$, $\\angle D = 53^\\circ$, and $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AD}$, respectively. Find the length $MN$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Extend $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ to meet at a point $E$. Then $\\angle AED = 180 - 53 - 37 = 90^{\\circ}$.\n[asy] size(220); defaultpen(0.7+fontsize(10)); real f=100, r=1004/f; pair A=(0,0), D=(2*r, 0), N=(r,0), E=N+r*expi(74*pi/180); pair B=(126*A+125*E)/251, C=(126*D + 125*E)/251; pair[] M = intersectionpoints(N--E,B--C); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle);  draw(B--E--C,dashed); draw(M[0]--N); draw(N--E,dashed); draw(rightanglemark(D,E,A,2)); picture p = new picture;  draw(p,Circle(N,r),dashed+linewidth(0.5)); clip(p,A--D--D+(0,20)--A+(0,20)--cycle); add(p); label(\"\\(A\\)\",A,SW); label(\"\\(B\\)\",B,NW); label(\"\\(C\\)\",C,NE); label(\"\\(D\\)\",D,SE); label(\"\\(E\\)\",E,NE); label(\"\\(M\\)\",M[0],SW); label(\"\\(N\\)\",N,S); label(\"\\(1004\\)\",(N+D)/2,S); label(\"\\(500\\)\",(M[0]+C)/2,S); [/asy]\nAs $\\angle AED = 90^{\\circ}$, note that the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, $N$, is the center of the circumcircle of $\\triangle AED$. We can do the same with the circumcircle about $\\triangle BEC$ and $M$ (or we could apply the homothety to find $ME$ in terms of $NE$). It follows that\n\\[NE = ND = \\frac {AD}{2} = 1004, \\quad ME = MC = \\frac {BC}{2} = 500.\\]\nThus $MN = NE - ME = \\boxed{504}$.\nFor purposes of rigor we will show that $E,M,N$ are collinear. Since $\\overline{BC} \\parallel \\overline{AD}$, then $BC$ and $AD$ are homothetic with respect to point $E$ by a ratio of $\\frac{BC}{AD} = \\frac{125}{251}$. Since the homothety carries the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, $M$, to the midpoint of $\\overline{AD}$, which is $N$, then $E,M,N$ are collinear.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AX = XY = YB = BC$ and the measure of angle $ABC$ is 120 degrees. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$?\n\n[asy]\npair A,X,Y,B,C;\nX = A + dir(30); Y = X + dir(0); B = Y + dir(60); C = B + dir(-30);\ndraw(B--Y--X--B--C--A--X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$X$\",X,NW); label(\"$Y$\",Y,S); label(\"$B$\",B,N); label(\"$C$\",C,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $t$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$ (which is what we want to compute).\n\nSince $AX=XY$, we have $\\angle AYX = \\angle YAX = \\angle BAC = t^\\circ$. Then, since the sum of angles in $\\triangle AXY$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle AXY = (180-2t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AXY$ and $\\angle BXY$ add to form a straight angle, so they are supplementary; $\\angle BXY = (180-(180-2t))^\\circ = (2t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $XY=YB$, we have $\\angle XBY = \\angle BXY = (2t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle XYB$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle XYB = (180-4t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AYX$, $\\angle XYB$, and $\\angle BYC$ add to form a straight angle, so their sum is $180^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle BYC = (180-t-(180-4t))^\\circ = (3t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $YB=BC$, we have $\\angle YCB = \\angle BYC = (3t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle YBC$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle YBC = (180-6t)^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, $\\angle ABC = \\angle XBY + \\angle YBC = (2t)^\\circ + (180-6t)^\\circ = (180-4t)^\\circ$. We know this is equal to $120^\\circ$, so we solve the equation $$180-4t = 120$$ to obtain $t=\\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ are isosceles with $AB=BC$ and $AD=DC$. Point $D$ is inside $\\triangle ABC$, $\\angle ABC = 40^\\circ$, and $\\angle ADC = 140^\\circ$.  What is the degree measure of $\\angle\nBAD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, \\[\n\\angle BAC=\\frac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\left( 180^{\\circ}-\\angle ABC\\displaystyle\\right)=70^{\\circ}.\n\\] [asy]\npair A,B,C,D;\nA=(-5,0); B=(0,21); C=(5,0); D=(0,6);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw(A--D--C--cycle,linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$140^{\\circ}$\",(0,4),S);\nlabel(\"$40^{\\circ}$\",(0,15),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\n[/asy] Similarly, \\[\n\\angle DAC=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( 180^{\\circ}-\\angle\nADC\\right)=20^{\\circ}.\n\\]  Thus \\[\\angle BAD = \\angle BAC - \\angle DAC\n= \\boxed{50^{\\circ}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Compute $\\sin 60^\\circ$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $60^\\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.\n\n[asy]\n\npair A,C,P,O,D;\n\ndraw((0,-1.2)--(0,1.2),p=black+1.2bp,Arrows(0.15cm));\n\ndraw((-1.2,0)--(1.2,0),p=black+1.2bp,Arrows(0.15cm));\n\nA = (1,0);\n\nO= (0,0);\n\nlabel(\"$x$\",(1.2,0),SE);\n\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,1.2),NE);\n\nP = rotate(60)*A;\n\nD = foot(P,A,-A);\n\ndraw(O--P--D);\n\ndraw(rightanglemark(O,D,P,2));\n\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\n\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,SE);\n\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,NE);\n\n//label(\"$A$\",A,SE);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\n\n[/asy]\n\nTriangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $DP = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.  Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$, so $\\sin 60^\\circ = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the triangle so that angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $C$ measures 30 degrees.  Define $D$ to be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to side $AC$.  Because angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $ADB$ is a right angle, triangle $ADB$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Since the length of a leg of a 45-45-90 triangle is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ times the length of the hypotenuse, $AD=BD=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot 6\\sqrt{2}=6$ units.  Also, $CDB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so we can multiply the short leg $BD$ by 2 to find the length of the hypotenuse and by $\\sqrt{3}$ to find the length of the longer leg.  This gives $BC=12$ units and $CD=6\\sqrt{3}$ units.  The sum of the lengths of sides $AC$ and $BC$ is $6+6\\sqrt{3}+12=18+6\\sqrt{3}$.  To the nearest tenth of a unit, this is $\\boxed{28.4}$ units.

If $\\angle ACB = 38^\\circ$, then find the measure of $\\angle AIE$, in degrees.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $AD$ is an angle bisector, $\\angle BAI = \\angle BAC/2$.  Since $BE$ is an angle bisector, $\\angle ABI = \\angle ABC/2$.  As an angle that is external to triangle $ABI$, $\\angle AIE = \\angle BAI + \\angle ABI = \\angle BAC/2 + \\angle ABC/2$.\n\n[asy]\nimport geometry;\n\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, I;\n\nA = (2,12);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (14,0);\nI = incenter(A,B,C);\nD = extension(A,I,B,C);\nE = extension(B,I,C,A);\nF = extension(C,I,A,B);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"$I$\", I, NNE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle ACB = 38^\\circ$, \\[\\angle AIE = \\frac{\\angle BAC + \\angle ABC}{2} = \\frac{180^\\circ - \\angle ACB}{2} = \\frac{180^\\circ - 38^\\circ}{2} = \\boxed{71^\\circ}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If the angles of a trapezoid form an arithmetic sequence and the smallest angle measures $60^{\\circ}$, what is the measure of the largest angle, in degrees?\n\nAnswer:\n",
