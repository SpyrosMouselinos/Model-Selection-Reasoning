    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A round pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick and has a diameter of 12 inches. It is cut into 12 congruent pieces. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one piece? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The entire pizza has radius 6 inches and volume $\\pi (6^2)(1/3) = 12\\pi$ cubic inches.  One slice has 1/12th this volume, or $\\boxed{\\pi}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle passes through the three vertices of an isosceles triangle that has two sides of length 3  and a base of length 2. What is the area of this circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $\\overline{BD}$ be an altitude of the isosceles $\\triangle ABC$, and let $O$ denote the center of the  circle with radius $r$ that passes through $A$, $B$, and $C$, as shown.\n\n[asy]\npair O,A,C,B,D;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-12,-16); C=(12,-16);\nD=(0,-16); B=(0,20);\ndraw(Circle(O,20),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(B--D,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(O--A,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$r$\",(0.6,10),W);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-5.3,-7.7),NW);\nlabel(\"1\",(-6,-16),N);\nlabel(\"3\",(-6,0),NW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(0,-15.7),S);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,E);\n[/asy]\n\nThen \\[\nBD = \\sqrt{3^2 - 1^2} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad OD = 2\\sqrt{2} - r.\n\\] Since $\\triangle ADO$ is a right triangle, we have \\[\nr^2 = 1^2 + \\left(2\\sqrt{2} - r\\right)^2 = 1 + 8 -4\\sqrt{2}r + r^2,\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad r = \\frac{9}{4\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{9}{8}\\sqrt{2}.\n\\] As a consequence, the circle has area \\[\n\\left( \\frac{9}{8}\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2\\pi = \\boxed{\\frac{81}{32}\\pi}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A dump truck delivered sand to a construction site. The sand formed a conical pile with a diameter of $8$ feet and a height that was $75\\%$ of the diameter. How many cubic feet of sand were in the pile? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The height of the cone is $\\frac{3}{4} \\times 8 = 6$. The radius of the cone is $\\frac{8}{2} = 4$. Therefore, the volume of the cone formed is $\\frac{4^2 \\times 6 \\times \\pi}{3} = \\boxed{32 \\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylinder with a height of 5 inches has a radius of 2 inches. What is the area of the curved surface of the cylinder, in square inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The lateral area of a cylinder is $2\\pi rh$. Since $h = 5$ and $r = 2$, our answer is $2\\pi\\cdot 2\\cdot 5 = \\boxed{20\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is circumscribed about an equilateral triangle with side lengths of $9$ units each.  What is the area of the circle, in square units? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8));\ndraw((0,0)--(4.5,7.794)--(9,0)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((4.5,2.598),5.196));\ndraw((4.5,7.794)--(4.5,0));\ndot((4.5,2.598));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(4.5,2.598),W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(4.5,7.794),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(9,0),E);\nlabel(\"$M$\",(4.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\n\nAbove is the diagram implied by the problem, with some added lines ($O$ is the center of the circle). Since $\\triangle AMB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and $AB=9$, $AM=4.5\\sqrt{3}$. Since $AO$ is $2/3$ of $AM$, $AO=3\\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the area of the circle is $\\pi(3\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{27\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square and a circle intersect so that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a given sphere is $36\\pi$ cubic inches. How many square inches are in its surface area? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Here, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=36\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\\pi(3^2)=\\boxed{36\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The number of inches in the perimeter of an equilateral triangle equals the number of square inches in the area of its circumscribed circle. What is the radius, in inches, of the circle? Express your answer in terms of pi and in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the triangle have vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, let $O$ be the center of the circle, and let $D$ be the midpoint of $\n\\overline{BC}$. Triangle $COD$ is a $30 - 60 - 90$ degree triangle. If $r$ is the radius of the circle, then the sides of $\\triangle COD$ are $r$, $\\frac{r}{2}$, and $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $6\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\displaystyle\\right)=3r\\sqrt{3}$, and the area of the circle is $\\pi r^{2}$. Thus $3r\\sqrt{3} = \\pi r^{2}$, and $r =\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{\\pi}}$.\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,D,O;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(0,1);\nB=(0.87,-0.5);\nC=(-0.87,-0.5);\nD=(0,-0.5);\ndraw(Circle(O,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(C--O--D--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$\\frac{r}{2}$\",(0,-0.25),E);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}$\",(-0.43,-0.5),S);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-0.43,-0.25),NW);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,N);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A certain circle's area is $x$ square units, and its circumference is $y$ units. The value of $x + y$ is $80\\pi$. What is the radius of the circle, in units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $r$ is the radius of the circle, we know that $x = \\pi r^2$ and $y = 2\\pi r$. Thus, we have \\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 80\\pi\\\\\n\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r &= 80\\pi\\\\\nr(r + 2) &= 80.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe want to find two integers whose product is 80, such that one integer is two more than the other. We note that 80 can be factored as $8\\cdot 10$. Therefore, $r = \\boxed{8}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle and O is the center of its inscribed circle. If the area of the circle is $4\\pi$ sq cm, what is the area, in square centimeters, of triangle ABC? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\nNote: The area of a circle with radius $r$ is $\\pi r^2.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we note that the radius of the inscribed circle is 2 cm (since $\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi$ implies that $r=2$, given that $r$ is nonnegative).\n\nLet $X$ be the midpoint of side $BC$. Thus segment $OX$ is a radius of the inscribed circle: [asy]\nunitsize(16);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2));\ndraw(((-2*sqrt(3),-2)--(2*sqrt(3),-2)--(0,4)--cycle));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,-2)));\ndraw(((-sqrt(3),1)--(0,0)--(sqrt(3),1)));\ndot((0,4)); label(\"A\",(0,4),N);\ndot((-2*sqrt(3),-2)); label(\"B\",(-2*sqrt(3),-2),SW);\ndot((2*sqrt(3),-2)); label(\"C\",(2*sqrt(3),-2),SE);\ndot((0,0)); label(\"O\",(0,0),N);\ndot((0,-2)); label(\"X\",(0,-2),S);\ndot((-sqrt(3),1)); dot((sqrt(3),1));\nlabel(\"2\",(0,-1),E);\n[/asy] Then $COX$ is a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so the sides $OX$, $CX$, and $CO$ are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Since $OX=2$, we have $CX=2\\sqrt 3$.\n\nTriangle $ACX$ is also a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so the sides $CX$, $AX$, and $AC$ are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Thus, $AX=(2\\sqrt3)(\\sqrt 3)=6$.\n\nTriangle $ABC$ has base $BC = 2(XC) = 4\\sqrt 3$ and corresponding height $AX = 6$, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}(4\\sqrt 3)(6) = \\boxed{12\\sqrt 3}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When the diameter of a pizza increases by 2 inches, the area increases by $44\\%$. What was the area, in square inches, of the original pizza? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nAnswer:\n",
