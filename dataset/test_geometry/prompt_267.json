    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n [asy] draw((0,0)--(0,2)--(2,2)--(2,0)--cycle,dot); draw((2,2)--(0,0)--(0,1)--cycle,dot); draw((0,2)--(1,0),dot); MP(\"B\",(0,0),SW);MP(\"A\",(0,2),NW);MP(\"D\",(2,2),NE);MP(\"C\",(2,0),SE); MP(\"E\",(0,1),W);MP(\"F\",(1,0),S);MP(\"H\",(2/3,2/3),E);MP(\"I\",(2/5,6/5),N); dot((1,0));dot((0,1));dot((2/3,2/3));dot((2/5,6/5)); [/asy]\nIf $ABCD$ is a $2\\times2$ square, $E$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$,$F$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$,$\\overline{AF}$ and $\\overline{DE}$ intersect at $I$, and $\\overline{BD}$ and $\\overline{AF}$ intersect at $H$, then the area of quadrilateral $BEIH$ is\n$\\text{(A) } \\frac{1}{3}\\quad \\text{(B) } \\frac{2}{5}\\quad \\text{(C) } \\frac{7}{15}\\quad \\text{(D) } \\frac{8}{15}\\quad \\text{(E) } \\frac{3}{5}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we find out the coordinates of the vertices of quadrilateral $BEIH$, then use the Shoelace Theorem to solve for the area. Denote $B$ as $(0,0)$. Then $E (0,1)$. Since I is the intersection between lines $DE$ and $AF$, and since the equations of those lines are $y = \\dfrac{1}{2}x + 1$ and $y = -2x + 2$, $I (\\dfrac{2}{5}, \\dfrac{6}{5})$. Using the same method, the equation of line $BD$ is $y = x$, so $H (\\dfrac{2}{3}, \\dfrac{2}{3})$. Using the Shoelace Theorem, the area of $BEIH$ is $\\dfrac{1}{2}\\cdot\\dfrac{14}{15} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{15}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Parallelogram $ABCD$ with $A(2,5)$, $B(4,9)$, $C(6,5)$, and $D(4,1)$ is reflected across the $x$-axis to $A'B'C'D'$ and then $A'B'C'D'$ is reflected across the line $y=x+1$ to $A''B''C''D''$. This is done such that $D'$ is the image of $D$, and $D''$ is the image of $D'$. What is the ordered pair of $D''$ in the coordinate plane?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Reflecting a point across the $x$-axis multiplies its $y$-coordinate by $-1$.  Therefore, $D'=(4,-1)$.  To reflect $D'$ across the line $y=x+1$, we first translate both the line and the point down one unit so that the equation of the translated line is $y=x$ and the coordinates of the translated point are $(4,-2)$.  To reflect across $y=x$, we switch the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate to obtain $(-2,4)$.  Translating this point one unit up, we find that $D''=\\boxed{(-2,5)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the number of square units in the area of the shaded region. [asy]\nsize(200);\ndraw((0,0)--(30,0)--(30,30)--(0, 30)--cycle);\ndot((30,0));dot((0,0));dot((10,0));dot((30,20));dot((30,30)); dot((20,30));dot((0,30));dot((0,10));\nfilldraw((0,0)--(10,0)--(30,20)--(30,30)--(20,30)--(0,10)--(0,0)--cycle, lightgray);\ndraw((0,0)--(60,0),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,0)--(-30,0),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,50),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,-30),EndArrow);\nlabel(\"(0,0)\",(0,0), SW, fontsize(8));\nlabel(\"(10,0)\",(10,0), S, fontsize(8));\nlabel(\"(30,0)\",(30,0), S, fontsize(8));\nlabel(\"(30,20)\",(30,20), E, fontsize(8));\nlabel(\"(20,30)\",(20,30), N, fontsize(8));\nlabel(\"(0,30)\",(0,30), W, fontsize(8));\nlabel(\"(30,30)\",(30,30), NE, fontsize(8));\nlabel(\"(0,10)\",(0,10), W, fontsize(8));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The area of the shaded figure can be found by taking the area of the large square and then subtracting the areas of the two unshaded triangles. The square has dimensions $30$-by-$30$ so it has an area of $30\\cdot 30 = 900$. Both triangles have a base and height of $20$ so their combined area is $2\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}bh = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(20)(20)=400$. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is $900-400=\\boxed{500}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $P$ and $R$ are located at (2, 1) and (12, 15) respectively. Point $M$ is the midpoint of segment $\\overline{PR}$. Segment $\\overline{PR}$ is reflected over the $x$-axis. What is the sum of the coordinates of the image of point $M$ (the midpoint of the reflected segment)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Point $M$ has coordinates $(7,8)$. Therefore, its image has coordinates $(7,-8)$. Thus the sum is $7-8 = \\boxed{-1}$.\n\nAlternatively, the image of point $M$ is the midpoint of the images of points $P$ and $R$ and thus is the midpoint of $(2,-1)$ and $(12,-15)$, which is also $(7,-8)$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The figure drawn is not to scale. Which of the five segments shown is the longest?

Then $\\angle ABD < \\angle ADB < \\angle BAD$, so $AD < AB < BD$.\n\nLooking at triangle $BCD$, we see that $\\angle BCD = 180^\\circ - \\angle CBD - \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ - 75^\\circ - 55^\\circ = 50^\\circ$.  Then $\\angle BCD < \\angle BDC < \\angle CBD$, so $BD < BC < CD$.\n\nCombining both inequalities, we see that \\[AD < AB < BD < BC < CD.\\]Therefore, the longest segment is $\\boxed{CD}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n [asy] pair A = (0,0), B = (7,4.2), C = (10, 0), D = (3, -5), E = (3, 0), F = (7,0); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle,dot); draw(A--E--F--C,dot); draw(D--E--F--B,dot); markscalefactor = 0.1; draw(rightanglemark(B, A, D)); draw(rightanglemark(D, E, C)); draw(rightanglemark(B, F, A)); draw(rightanglemark(D, C, B)); MP(\"A\",(0,0),W); MP(\"B\",(7,4.2),N); MP(\"C\",(10,0),E); MP(\"D\",(3,-5),S); MP(\"E\",(3,0),N); MP(\"F\",(7,0),S); [/asy]\nIn the figure $ABCD$ is a quadrilateral with right angles at $A$ and $C$. Points $E$ and $F$ are on $\\overline{AC}$, and $\\overline{DE}$ and $\\overline{BF}$ are perpendicual to $\\overline{AC}$. If $AE=3, DE=5,$ and $CE=7$, then $BF=$\n$\\text{(A) } 3.6\\quad \\text{(B) } 4\\quad \\text{(C) } 4.2\\quad \\text{(D) } 4.5\\quad \\text{(E) } 5$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label the angles as shown in the diagram. Since $\\angle DEC$ forms a linear pair with $\\angle DEA$, $\\angle DEA$ is a right angle.\n[asy] pair A = (0,0), B = (7,4.2), C = (10, 0), D = (3, -5), E = (3, 0), F = (7,0); draw(A--B--C--D--cycle,dot); draw(A--E--F--C,dot); draw(D--E--F--B,dot);  markscalefactor = 0.075;  draw(rightanglemark(B, A, D)); draw(rightanglemark(D, E, A)); draw(rightanglemark(B, F, A)); draw(rightanglemark(D, C, B)); draw(rightanglemark(D, E, C)); draw(rightanglemark(B, F, C)); MP(\"A\",(0,0),W); MP(\"B\",(7,4.2),N); MP(\"C\",(10,0),E); MP(\"D\",(3,-5),S); MP(\"E\",(3,0),N); MP(\"F\",(7,0),S); [/asy]\nLet $\\angle DAE = \\alpha$ and $\\angle ADE = \\beta$.\nSince $\\alpha + \\beta = 90^\\circ$, and $\\alpha + \\angle BAF = 90^\\circ$, then $\\beta = \\angle BAF$. By the same logic, $\\angle ABF = \\alpha$.\nAs a result, $\\triangle AED \\sim \\triangle BFA$. By the same logic, $\\triangle CFB \\sim \\triangle DEC$.\nThen, $\\frac{BF}{AF} = \\frac{3}{5}$, and $\\frac{CF}{BF} = \\frac{5}{7}$.\nThen, $7CF = 5BF$, and $5BF = 3AF$.\nBy the transitive property, $7CF = 3AF$. $AC = AF + CF = 10$, and plugging in, we get $CF = 3$.\nFinally, plugging in to $\\frac{CF}{BF} = \\frac{5}{7}$, we get $BF = \\boxed{4.2}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The center of a circle has coordinates $(6,-5)$. The circle is reflected about the line $y=x$. What are the $x,y$ coordinates of the center of the image circle? State the $x$ coordinate first.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The center of the image circle is simply the center of the original circle reflected over the line $y=x$. When reflecting over this line, we swap the $x$ and $y$ coordinates. Thus, the image center is the point $\\boxed{(-5, 6)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the number of square units in the area of the triangle.\n\n[asy]size(125);\ndraw( (-10,-2) -- (2,10), Arrows);\ndraw( (0,-2)-- (0,10) ,Arrows);\ndraw( (5,0) -- (-10,0),Arrows);\n\nlabel(\"$l$\",(2,10), NE);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (5,0) , E);\nlabel(\"$y$\", (0,-2) , S);\nfilldraw( (-8,0) -- (0,8) -- (0,0) -- cycle, lightgray);\ndot( (-2, 6)); dot( (-6, 2)); label( \"(-2, 6)\", (-2, 6), W, fontsize(10)); label( \"(-6, 2)\", (-6, 2), W, fontsize(10));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We first notice that the vertical and horizontal distances between the two points are both $4$, so the slope of the line which the two points are on must be $1$. We now find the length of the legs of the triangle. Since the slope of the line is one, we can add $2$ to both the $x$ and $y$-coordinates of $(-2,6)$ and get that the line passes through $(0,8)$. Similarly, we can subtract $2$ from the $x$ and $y$-coordinates of $(-6,2)$ to find that it passes through $(-8,0)$. We now have a right triangle with legs of length $8$, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}bh=\\frac{1}{2}(8)(8)=\\boxed{32}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The image of the point with coordinates $(-3,-1)$ under the reflection across the line $y=mx+b$ is the point with coordinates $(5,3)$.  Find $m+b$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection.  The slope of the segment is $\\frac{3-(-1)}{5-(-3)}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Since the line of reflection is perpendicular, its slope, $m$, equals $-2$.  By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment is $\\left(\\frac{5-3}2,\\frac{3-1}2\\right)=(1,1)$.   Since the line of reflection goes through this point, we have $1=(-2)(1)+b$, and so $b=3$.  Thus $m+b=\\boxed{1}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An equilateral triangle has two vertices at $(0,5)$ and $(8,5)$. If the third vertex is in the first quadrant, what is the y-coordinate? Express your answer in simplest radical form. [asy]\ndraw((-1,0)--(11,0),Arrows);\ndraw((0,-1)--(0,12),Arrows);\nfor(int i=0;i<11;++i)\n{draw((i,-0.1)--(i,0.1));}\nfor(int j=0;j<11;++j)\n{draw((-0.1,j)--(0.1,j));}\ndot((0,5));\ndot((8,5));\nlabel(\"(0,5)\",(0,5),W);\ndraw((0,5)--(8,5));\nlabel(\"(8,5)\",(8,5),E);\nsize(6cm);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To begin this problem, we first notice that the side length of this equilateral triangle is $8$ (the distance between the two points given). We then consider the altitude of an equilateral triangle with side length $8$. If we draw an equilateral triangle and its altitude, we notice that the altitude splits the equilateral triangle into two $30-60-90$ triangles with the side length being the hypotenuse of these triangles. In our case, the hypotenuse of the $30-60-90$ triangle has length $8$, so the altitude (the side opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle) has length $4\\sqrt{3}$ because the side lengths of a $30-60-90$ triangle are related in the ratio $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$.\n\nSince the base of the equilateral triangle is at a $y$-coordinate of $5$ and $4\\sqrt{3}>5$, for the third vertex to be in the first quadrant, its $y$ coordinate must be $5$ $+ $ the altitude of the equilateral triangle. The third vertex has a $y$-coordinate of $\\boxed{5+4\\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If the point $(3,4)$ is reflected in the $x$-axis, what are the coordinates of its image?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((-5.5,0)--(5.5,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((-5.5,0)--(5.5,0),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,-5.5)--(0,5.5),EndArrow);\ndraw((0,-5.5)--(0,5.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((-5,-5)--(-5,5)--(5,5)--(5,-5)--cycle);\ndraw((-4,-5)--(-4,5));\ndraw((-3,-5)--(-3,5));\ndraw((-2,-5)--(-2,5));\ndraw((-1,-5)--(-1,5));\ndraw((1,-5)--(1,5));\ndraw((2,-5)--(2,5));\ndraw((3,-5)--(3,5));\ndraw((4,-5)--(4,5));\ndraw((-5,-4)--(5,-4));\ndraw((-5,-3)--(5,-3));\ndraw((-5,-2)--(5,-2));\ndraw((-5,-1)--(5,-1));\ndraw((-5,1)--(5,1));\ndraw((-5,2)--(5,2));\ndraw((-5,3)--(5,3));\ndraw((-5,4)--(5,4));\ndot((3,4));\nlabel(\"$x$\",(5.5,0),E);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,5.5),N);\nlabel(\"$(3,4)$\",(3,4),NE);\n[/asy]\n\nAnswer:\n",
