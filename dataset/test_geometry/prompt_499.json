    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circles of radius 2 and 3 are externally tangent and are circumscribed by a third circle, as shown in the figure. Find the area of the shaded region. Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\nfill(Circle((-1,0),5),gray(0.7));\nfill(Circle((-3,0),3),white);\nfill(circle((2,0),2),white);\ndot((-3,0));\ndot((2,0));\ndraw(Circle((-1,0),5));\ndraw((-3,0)--(0,0));\ndraw((2,0)--(4,0));\nlabel(\"3\",(-1.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"2\",(3,0),N);\ndraw(Circle((-3,0),3));\ndraw(Circle((2,0),2));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The diameter of the large circle is $6+4=10$, so its radius is 5. Hence, the area of the shaded region is $$\n\\pi(5^2)-\\pi(3^2)-\\pi(2^2)=\\pi(25-9-4)=\\boxed{12\\pi}.\n$$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $A$ has its center at $A(4, 4)$ and has a radius of 4 units. Circle $B$ has its center at $B(12, 4)$ and has a radius of 4 units. What is the area of the gray region bound by the circles and the $x$-axis? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$. [asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nxaxis(0,16,Ticks(\"%\",1.0));\nyaxis(0,8,Ticks(\"%\",1.0));\nfill((4,4)--(12,4)--(12,0)--(4,0)--cycle,gray(0.7));\nfilldraw(circle((4,4),4),fillpen=white);\nfilldraw(circle((12,4),4),fillpen=white);\ndot(\"$A$\",(4,4),S); dot(\"$B$\",(12,4),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Draw a 4 by 8 rectangle with the vertices at $(4, 4), (12, 4), (12, 0)$ and $(4, 0)$. The area of that box is $4 \\times 8 = 32$ square units. From that we can subtract the area of the sectors of the 2 circles that are binding our shaded region. The area of each sector is $(1/4)4^2\\pi = 4\\pi$; therefore, we need to subtract $2(4\\pi) = 8\\pi$. This gives us $\\boxed{32 - 8\\pi}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the figure below, the smaller circle has a radius of two feet and the larger circle has a radius of four feet. What is the total area of the four shaded regions? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n\n[asy]\nfill((0,0)--(12,0)--(12,-4)--(4,-4)--(4,-2)--(0,-2)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(12,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,-2),linewidth(1));\ndraw((4,0)--(4,-4),linewidth(1));\ndraw((12,0)--(12,-4),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0.3,0)--(0.3,-0.3)--(0,-0.3));\ndraw((4.3,0)--(4.3,-0.3)--(4,-0.3));\ndraw((11.7,0)--(11.7,-0.3)--(12,-0.3));\nfill(Circle((2,-2),2),white);\nfill(Circle((8,-4),4),white);\ndraw(Circle((2,-2),2));\ndraw(Circle((8,-4),4));\ndot((2,-2));\ndot((8,-4));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Draw horizontal diameters of both circles to form two rectangles, both surrounding shaded regions. The height of each rectangle is a radius and the length is a diameter, so the left rectangle is 2 ft $\\times$ 4 ft and the right rectangle is 4 ft $\\times$ 8 ft. The shaded region is obtained by subtracting respective semicircles from each rectangle, so the total area of the shaded region in square feet is $A = [(2)(4) - \\dfrac{1}{2}\\pi \\cdot(2)^2] +\n[(4)(8) - \\dfrac{1}{2}\\pi \\cdot(4)^2] = 40 - 10\\pi \\approx \\boxed{8.6}$.\n\nEquivalently, we could notice that since the right side of the figure is scaled up from the left side by a factor of 2, areas will be scaled by a factor of $2^2 = 4$, and the right shaded region will be 4 times the size of the left shaded region. Then $A = 5[(2)(4) - \\dfrac{1}{2}\\pi \\cdot(2)^2],$ giving the same result.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The vertices of a $3 - 4 - 5$ right triangle are the centers of three mutually externally tangent circles, as shown.   What is the sum of the areas of these circles?\n\n[asy]unitsize(1cm);\ndraw(Circle((1.8,2.4),1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((5,0),3),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(5,0)--(1.8,2.4)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(1.8,2.4),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(5,0),E);\nlabel(\"5\",(2.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"4\",(3.4,1.2),NE);\nlabel(\"3\",(0.9,1.2),NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$, $s$, and $t$ be the radii of the circles centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively. Then $r+s=3$, $r+t=4$, and $s+t=5$.  Adding these three equations gives $2(r+s+t) = 12$, so $r+s+t = 6$.  Combining this with the original three equations, we get $r=1$, $s=2$, and $t=3$. Thus the sum of the areas of the circles is \\[\n\\pi(1^2+2^2+3^2)=\\boxed{14\\pi}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the diagram, the smaller circles touch the larger circle and touch each other at the center of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is $6.$ What is the area of the shaded region?\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\nimport graph;\nfilldraw(Circle((0,0),2),mediumgray);\nfilldraw(Circle((-1,0),1),white);\nfilldraw(Circle((1,0),1),white);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label the center of the larger circle $O$ and the points of contact between the larger circle and the smaller circles $A$ and $B.$ Draw the radius $OA$ of the larger circle.\n\n[asy]\nsize(120);\nimport graph;\nfilldraw(Circle((0,0),2),mediumgray);\nfilldraw(Circle((-1,0),1),white);\nfilldraw(Circle((1,0),1),white);\ndraw((-2,0)--(0,0));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-2,0),W); label(\"$O$\",(0,0),E); label(\"$B$\",(2,0),E);\n\n[/asy]\n\nSince the smaller circle and the larger circle touch at $A,$ the diameter through $A$ of the smaller circle lies along the diameter through $A$ of the larger circle. (This is because each diameter is perpendicular to the common tangent at the point of contact.)\n\nSince $AO$ is a radius of the larger circle, it is a diameter of the smaller circle.\n\nSince the radius of the larger circle is $6,$ the diameter of the smaller circle is $6,$ so the radius of the smaller circle on the left is $3.$\n\nSimilarly, we can draw a radius through $O$ and $B$ and deduce that the radius of the smaller circle on the right is also $3.$ The area of the shaded region equals the area of the larger circle minus the combined area of the two smaller circles. Thus, the area of the shaded region is $$6^2\\pi - 3^2\\pi - 3^2\\pi = 36\\pi - 9\\pi - 9\\pi = \\boxed{18\\pi}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square and four circles, each with a radius of 5 inches, are arranged as shown. What is the area, in square inches, of the square? [asy]\nunitsize(1mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7pt));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(20,0)--(20,20)--(0,20)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((5,5),5));\ndraw(Circle((15,5),5));\ndraw(Circle((5,15),5));\ndraw(Circle((15,15),5));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The side length of the square is equal to twice the diameter of one of the circles, so the area of the square is $(20\\text{ in})(20\\text{ in})=\\boxed{400}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Semicircles of diameter 2'' are lined up as shown. What is the area, in square inches, of the shaded region in a 1-foot length of this pattern? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]import graph;\nsize(101);\n\npath tophalf = Arc((0,0),1,180,0) -- Arc((2,0),1,180,0) -- Arc((4,0),1,180,0) -- Arc((6,0),1,180,0) -- Arc((8,0),1,180,90);\npath bottomhalf = Arc((7,0),1,360,180) -- Arc((5,0),1,360,180) -- Arc((3,0),1,360,180) -- Arc((1,0),1,360,180) -- Arc((-1,0),1,360,270);\nfill(tophalf--bottomhalf--cycle,gray(.6));\ndraw(tophalf,linewidth(1.5)); draw(bottomhalf,linewidth(1));\ndraw(\"$1'$\",(-3,1.5)--(10,1.5),N,linewidth(1.5),Arrows(4));\ndraw((-3,1.25)--(-3,1.75),linewidth(1.5)); draw((10,1.25)--(10,1.75),linewidth(1.5));\ndot((-5/3,0),linewidth(3)); dot((-7/3,0),linewidth(3)); dot((-3,0),linewidth(3));\ndot((26/3,0),linewidth(3)); dot((28/3,0),linewidth(3)); dot((10,0),linewidth(3));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n 12 inches of the pattern contains one semicircle on top and on bottom for each diameter, or $\\frac{12}{2}\\cdot2=12$ total semicircles. This is the equivalent of 6 full circles, so the shaded area is $6\\cdot1^2\\pi=\\boxed{6\\pi}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of triangle $ABC$?

We find $AB=7-(-3)=10$ by subtracting the $x$-coordinates of $A$ and $B$.  Let $D$ be the foot of the perpendicular line drawn from $C$ to line $AB$.  We find a height of $CD=1-(-3)=4$ by subtracting the $y$-coordinates of $C$ and $D$.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(10)(4)=\\boxed{20\\text{ square units}}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=4;\npair A=(-3,1), B=(7,1), C=(5,-3), D=(5,1);\npair[] dots={A,B,C,D};\nreal[] xticks={-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8};\nreal[] yticks={3,2,1,-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7};\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndot(dots);\nlabel(\"A(-3,1)\",A,N);\nlabel(\"B(7,1)\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"C(5,-3)\",C,S);\nlabel(\"D(5,1)\",D,N);\nxaxis(-5,9,Ticks(\" \", xticks, 3),Arrows(4));\nyaxis(-8,4,Ticks(\" \", yticks, 3),Arrows(4));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the diagram, $PQ$ and $RS$ are diameters of a circle with radius 4.  If $PQ$ and $RS$ are perpendicular, what is the area of the shaded region?\n\n[asy]\nsize(120);\nimport graph;\nfill((-1,-1)--(-1,1)--(1,1)--(1,-1)--cycle,mediumgray);\nfill(Arc((0,0),sqrt(2),45,135)--cycle,mediumgray);fill(Arc((0,0),sqrt(2),225,315)--cycle,mediumgray);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),sqrt(2)));\ndraw((-1,-1)--(1,1)--(1,-1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\nlabel(\"$P$\",(-1,1),NW); label(\"$R$\",(1,1),NE); label(\"$S$\",(-1,-1),SW); label(\"$Q$\",(1,-1),SE);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Diameters $PQ$ and $RS$ cross at the center of the circle, which we call $O$.\n\nThe area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of $\\triangle POS$ and $\\triangle ROQ$ plus the sum of the areas of sectors $POR$ and $SOQ$.\n\nEach of $\\triangle POS$ and $\\triangle ROQ$ is right-angled and has its two perpendicular sides of length 4 (the radius of the circle).\n\nTherefore, the area of each of these triangles is $\\frac{1}{2}(4)(4)=8$.\n\nEach of sector $POR$ and sector $SOQ$ has area $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the total area of the circle, as each has central angle $90^\\circ$ (that is, $\\angle POR = \\angle SOQ = 90^\\circ$) and $90^\\circ$ is one-quarter of the total central angle.\n\nTherefore, each sector has area $\\frac{1}{4}(\\pi(4^2))=\\frac{1}{4}(16\\pi)=4\\pi$.\n\nThus, the total shaded area is $2(8)+2(4\\pi)=\\boxed{16+8\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the number of square units in the area of the triangle.\n\n[asy]size(125);\ndraw( (-10,-2) -- (2,10), Arrows);\ndraw( (0,-2)-- (0,10) ,Arrows);\ndraw( (5,0) -- (-10,0),Arrows);\n\nlabel(\"$l$\",(2,10), NE);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (5,0) , E);\nlabel(\"$y$\", (0,-2) , S);\nfilldraw( (-8,0) -- (0,8) -- (0,0) -- cycle, lightgray);\ndot( (-2, 6)); dot( (-6, 2)); label( \"(-2, 6)\", (-2, 6), W, fontsize(10)); label( \"(-6, 2)\", (-6, 2), W, fontsize(10));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We first notice that the vertical and horizontal distances between the two points are both $4$, so the slope of the line which the two points are on must be $1$. We now find the length of the legs of the triangle. Since the slope of the line is one, we can add $2$ to both the $x$ and $y$-coordinates of $(-2,6)$ and get that the line passes through $(0,8)$. Similarly, we can subtract $2$ from the $x$ and $y$-coordinates of $(-6,2)$ to find that it passes through $(-8,0)$. We now have a right triangle with legs of length $8$, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}bh=\\frac{1}{2}(8)(8)=\\boxed{32}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle with center $C$ is shown.
