    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle whose vertices are at $(4, -1)$, $(10, 3)$ and $(4, 5)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$.  Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system, trapezoid $ABCD$ has vertices $A(1, -2)$, $B(1, 1)$, $C(5, 7)$ and $D(5, 1)$. What is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two bases of the trapezoids are the segments $AB$ and $CD$, and the height is the perpendicular distance between the bases, which in this case is the difference of the $x$-coordinates: $5 - 1 = 4$. Similarly, the lengths of the bases are the differences of the $y$-coordinates of their two endpoints. Using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}(b_1+ b_2)h$, the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(3+6)(4) = \\boxed{18}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Suppose $ABC$ is a scalene right triangle, and $P$ is the point on   hypotenuse $\\overline{AC}$ such that $\\angle{ABP} =\n45^{\\circ}$. Given that $AP = 1$ and $CP = 2$, compute the area of   $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\npair A,B,C,P;\n\nB = (0,0);\nA = (0,1);\nC = (2,0);\nP = A + (C-A)/3;\ndraw(P--B--A--C--B);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,NE);\n[/asy]\n\n\nNotice that $\\overline{BP}$ bisects the right angle at $B$. Thus, the Angle Bisector Theorem tells us that $AB/BC = AP/PC = 1/2$. So, we have $AB = x$ and $BC = 2x$ for some $x$.  By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $5x^2 =AC^2 = 9$, so $x^2 = \\frac95$.  Finally, the desired area $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(2x) = x^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{5}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle in a Cartesian coordinate plane has vertices (5, -2), (10, 5) and (5, 5). How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the given points in a coordinate plane, we find that the triangle is a right triangle whose legs have length $5-(-2)=7$ and $10-5=5$ units.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(7)(5)=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(8));\ndotfactor = 4;\ndraw((-1,0)--(10,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,10),Arrows(4));\npair A=(5,-2), B=(10,5), C=(5,5);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(rotate(90)*\"$5-(-2)$\",(0,0.2)+(A+C)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$10-5$\",(B+C)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$(5,-2)$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$(10,5)$\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"$(5,5)$\",C,NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices at $A(5,8)$, $B(3,-2)$, and $C(6,1)$. The point $D$ with coordinates $(m,n)$ is chosen inside the triangle so that the three small triangles $ABD$, $ACD$ and $BCD$ all have equal areas. What is the value of $10m + n$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $D$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, then $ABD$, $ACD$, and $BCD$ would all have equal areas (to see this, remember that the medians of a triangle divide the triangle into 6 equal areas). There is only one point with this property (if we move around $D$, the area of one of the small triangles will increase and will no longer be $1/3$ of the total area). So $D$ must be the centroid of triangle $ABC$. The $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the centroid are found by averaging the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, respectively, of the vertices, so $(m,n) = \\left( \\frac{5+3+6}{3}, \\frac{8+(-2)+1}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{14}{3}, \\frac{7}{3} \\right)$, and $10m + n = 10 \\left(\\frac{14}{3}\\right) + \\frac{7}{3} = \\boxed{49}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two similar right triangles have areas of 6 square inches and 150 square inches. The length of the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches. What is the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the smaller triangle has hypotenuse 5, we guess that it is a 3-4-5 triangle.  Sure enough, the area of a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4 is $(3)(4)/2 = 6$, so this works.  The area of the larger triangle is $150/6=25$ times the area of the smaller triangle, so its side lengths are $\\sqrt{25} = 5$ times as long as the side lengths of the smaller triangle.  Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle is $5(3+4) = \\boxed{35}$.\n\nProof that the only possibility for the smaller triangle is that it is a 3-4-5 triangle: Let's call the legs of the smaller triangle $a$ and $b$ (with $b$ being the longer leg) and the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle $c$. Similarly, let's call the corresponding legs of the larger triangle $A$ and $B$ and the hypotenuse of the larger triangle $C$. Since the area of the smaller triangle is 6 square inches, we can say  $$\\frac{1}{2}ab=6.$$ Additionally, we are told that the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches, so $c=5$ and $$a^2+b^2=25.$$ Because $\\frac{1}{2}ab=6$, we get $ab=12$ or $a=\\frac{12}{b}$. We can now write the equation in terms of $b$. We get \\begin{align*}\na^2+b^2&=25\\\\\n\\left(\\frac{12}{b}\\right)^{2}+b^2&=25\\\\\n12^2+b^4&=25b^2\\\\\nb^4-25b^2+144&=0.\n\\end{align*} Solving for $b$, we get  $$b^4-25b^2+144=(b-4)(b+4)(b-3)(b+3)=0.$$ Since we said that $b$ is the longer of the two legs, $b=4$ and $a=3$. Therefore, the triangle must be a 3-4-5 right triangle.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the smallest possible area, in square units, of a right triangle with two sides measuring $4$ units and $5$ units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $5>4$, $4$ cannot be the length of the hypotenuse. Thus either $4$ and $5$ are the lengths of the two smaller sides, or $5$ is the hypotenuse, meaning the two smaller sides are $4$ and $3$. In this latter case, the area will be smaller, so the area is $\\frac{(3)(4)}{2} = \\boxed{6}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n There are two natural ways to inscribe a square in a given isosceles right triangle. If it is done as in Figure 1 below, then one finds that the area of the square is $441 \\text{cm}^2$. What is the area (in $\\text{cm}^2$) of the square inscribed in the same $\\triangle ABC$ as shown in Figure 2 below?\n[asy] draw((0,0)--(10,0)--(0,10)--cycle); draw((-25,0)--(-15,0)--(-25,10)--cycle); draw((-20,0)--(-20,5)--(-25,5)); draw((6.5,3.25)--(3.25,0)--(0,3.25)--(3.25,6.5)); label(\"A\", (-25,10), W); label(\"B\", (-25,0), W); label(\"C\", (-15,0), E); label(\"Figure 1\", (-20, -5)); label(\"Figure 2\", (5, -5)); label(\"A\", (0,10), W); label(\"B\", (0,0), W); label(\"C\", (10,0), E); [/asy]\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 378 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 392 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 400 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 441 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 484$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We are given that the area of the inscribed square is $441$, so the side length of that square is $21$. Since the square divides the $45-45-90$ larger triangle into 2 smaller congruent $45-45-90$, then the legs of the larger isosceles right triangle ($BC$ and $AB$) are equal to $42$.[asy] draw((0,0)--(10,0)--(0,10)--cycle); draw((6.5,3.25)--(3.25,0)--(0,3.25)--(3.25,6.5)); label(\"A\", (0,10), W); label(\"B\", (0,0), W); label(\"C\", (10,0), E); label(\"S\", (25/3,11/6), E); label(\"S\", (11/6,25/3), E); label(\"S\", (5,5), NE); [/asy]\nWe now have that $3S=42\\sqrt{2}$, so $S=14\\sqrt{2}$.

Let $D$ and $D'$ be the points on $\\overline{AC}$ that are also on the smaller and larger circles, respectively. Since $\\triangle ADO$ and $\\triangle AD'O'$ are similar right triangles, we have \\[\n\\frac{AO}{1}= \\frac{AO'}{2}= \\frac{AO+3}{2}, \\quad\\text{so}\\quad AO = 3.\n\\]As a consequence, \\[\nAD = \\sqrt{AO^2 - OD^2} = \\sqrt{9-1}= 2\\sqrt{2}.\n\\][asy]\nunitsize(0.7cm);\npair A,B,C,F,D,G;\nA=(0,8);\nB=(-2.8,0);\nC=(2.8,0);\nF=(0,0);\nD=(0.9,5.3);\nG=(1.8,2.7);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((0,2),2),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((0,5),1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--F,linewidth(0.5));\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$O$'\",(0,2),W);\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,5),W);\nlabel(\"2\",(0.9,2.3),S);\nlabel(\"1\",(0.5,5.2),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,N);\ndraw((0,5)--D,linewidth(0.5));\ndraw((0,2)--G,linewidth(0.5));\nlabel(\"$D$'\",G,NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\n[/asy]\n\n\nLet  $F$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$.

Then $B$ is reflected over the line $y=x$ to $C$. What is the area of triangle $ABC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n When point $A$ is reflected over the $x$-axis, we get point B, which is $(3,-4)$. Reflecting point $B$ over the line $y=x$, we get that point $C$ is $(-4,3)$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is 8. The distance from point $C$ to the line connecting $A$ and $B$ is 7. Now we can draw the following diagram: [asy]\ndraw((0,8)--(0,-8),Arrows);\ndraw((8,0)--(-8,0),Arrows);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,8),N);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(8,0),E);\ndot((3,4));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(3,4),NE);\ndot((3,-4));\nlabel(\"$B$\",(3,-4),SE);\ndot((-4,3));\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-4,3),W);\ndraw((3,4)--(3,-4)--(-4,3)--cycle);\ndraw((-4,3)--(3,3),linetype(\"8 8\"));\n[/asy] We find that the triangle has a height of length 7 and a base of length 8.
