    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right triangle with legs $10$ and $8$ is similar to another right triangle with corresponding legs $x$ and $5$, respectively. What is the value of $x$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By similarity, we know that $\\frac{10}{x} = \\frac{8}{5}$, so therefore $x = \\frac{50}{8} = \\boxed{6.25}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If a triangle has two sides of lengths 5 and 7 units, then how many different integer lengths can the third side be?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $n$ be the length of the third side.  Then by the triangle inequality, \\begin{align*}\nn + 5 &> 7, \\\\\nn + 7 &> 5, \\\\\n5 + 7 &> n,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $n > 2$, $n > -2$, and $n < 12$.  Hence, the possible values of $n$ are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, for a total of $\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n For $x > 0$, the area of the triangle with vertices $(0, 0), (x, 2x)$, and $(x, 0)$ is 64 square units. What is the value of $x$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the given points, we find that the triangle is a right triangle whose legs measure $x$ and $2x$ units.  Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(2x)=64$, which we solve to find $x=\\boxed{8}$ units. [asy]\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nreal x=8;\npair A=(0,0), B=(x,2*x), C=(x,0);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nxaxis(-2,10,Arrows(4));\nyaxis(-2,20,Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"$(x,0)$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$(x,2x)$\",B,N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the triangle so that angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $C$ measures 30 degrees.  Define $D$ to be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to side $AC$.  Because angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $ADB$ is a right angle, triangle $ADB$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Since the length of a leg of a 45-45-90 triangle is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ times the length of the hypotenuse, $AD=BD=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot 6\\sqrt{2}=6$ units.  Also, $CDB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so we can multiply the short leg $BD$ by 2 to find the length of the hypotenuse and by $\\sqrt{3}$ to find the length of the longer leg.  This gives $BC=12$ units and $CD=6\\sqrt{3}$ units.  The sum of the lengths of sides $AC$ and $BC$ is $6+6\\sqrt{3}+12=18+6\\sqrt{3}$.  To the nearest tenth of a unit, this is $\\boxed{28.4}$ units.

However, this triangle doesn't work since the sum of any two side lengths must be greater than the third side length (by the Triangle Inequality). The next smallest triangle has lengths 2, 3, and 4, which works. Thus, the smallest possible perimeter is $2+3+4=\\boxed{9}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two similar right triangles have areas of 6 square inches and 150 square inches. The length of the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches. What is the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the smaller triangle has hypotenuse 5, we guess that it is a 3-4-5 triangle.  Sure enough, the area of a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4 is $(3)(4)/2 = 6$, so this works.  The area of the larger triangle is $150/6=25$ times the area of the smaller triangle, so its side lengths are $\\sqrt{25} = 5$ times as long as the side lengths of the smaller triangle.  Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle is $5(3+4) = \\boxed{35}$.\n\nProof that the only possibility for the smaller triangle is that it is a 3-4-5 triangle: Let's call the legs of the smaller triangle $a$ and $b$ (with $b$ being the longer leg) and the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle $c$. Similarly, let's call the corresponding legs of the larger triangle $A$ and $B$ and the hypotenuse of the larger triangle $C$. Since the area of the smaller triangle is 6 square inches, we can say  $$\\frac{1}{2}ab=6.$$ Additionally, we are told that the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches, so $c=5$ and $$a^2+b^2=25.$$ Because $\\frac{1}{2}ab=6$, we get $ab=12$ or $a=\\frac{12}{b}$. We can now write the equation in terms of $b$. We get \\begin{align*}\na^2+b^2&=25\\\\\n\\left(\\frac{12}{b}\\right)^{2}+b^2&=25\\\\\n12^2+b^4&=25b^2\\\\\nb^4-25b^2+144&=0.\n\\end{align*} Solving for $b$, we get  $$b^4-25b^2+144=(b-4)(b+4)(b-3)(b+3)=0.$$ Since we said that $b$ is the longer of the two legs, $b=4$ and $a=3$. Therefore, the triangle must be a 3-4-5 right triangle.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The lengths of the sides of a non-degenerate triangle are $x$, 13 and 37 units. How many integer values of $x$ are possible?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the triangle inequality, \\begin{align*}\nx + 13 &> 37, \\\\\nx + 37 &> 13, \\\\\n13 + 37 &> x,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $x > 24$, $x > -24$, and $x < 50$.  Hence, the possible values of $x$ are $25, 26, \\dots, 49$, for a total of $49 - 25 + 1 = \\boxed{25}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,5)$, and $(7,12)$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The base of the triangle lies on the $y$-axis, and is 5 units long. The height of the triangle is the horizontal distance from the point $(7,12)$ to the $y$-axis, and is 7 units long. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{5\\cdot7}{2}=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area of the triangle bounded by the lines $y=x,$ $y=-x,$ and $y=6$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(200); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nxlimits(-8,8); ylimits(-1,10);\nxaxis(Label(\"$x$\"),-8,8,EndArrow(size=5));\nyaxis(Label(\"$y$\"),-2,8,EndArrow(size=5));\ndot(\"$A(6,6)$\",(6,6)); dot(\"$B(-6,6)$\",(-6,6),W); dot(\"$O$\",(0,0),SW);\ndraw((0,0) -- (6,6));\ndraw((0,0) -- (-6,6));\ndraw((-6,6)--(6,6));\n[/asy]\nLet $O = (0,0)$, and let $A$ and $B$ denote the points where $y=6$ intersects $y=x$ and $y=-x,$ respectively. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(6, 6)$ and $(-6, 6),$ respectively, so $AB = 6 - (-6) = 12.$ Also, the length of the altitude from $O$ to $AB$ is $6.$ Thus the area of $\\triangle OAB$ is\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 12 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{36}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The side lengths of a right triangle measure $x$, $x + y$ and $x - y$ units where $0 < y < x$. What is the value of $y \\div x$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\nAnswer:\n",
