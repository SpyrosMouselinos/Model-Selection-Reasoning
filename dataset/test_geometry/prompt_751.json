    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the sum of the squares of the lengths of the $\\textbf{medians}$ of a triangle whose side lengths are $10,$ $10,$ and $12$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let us draw our triangle and medians and label our points of interest: [asy]\npair A, B, C, D, E, F;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-6, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nD = (0, 0);\nE = (3, 4);\nF = (-3, 4);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\n[/asy] We have made $AB = AC = 10$ and $BC = 12.$ We can notice a few useful things. Since $ABC$ is isosceles, it follows that $AD$ is an altitude as well as a median, which is useful for finding lengths, since it means we can use the Pythagorean Theorem. At this point, we can drop additional segments from $E$ and $F$ perpendicular to $BC,$ meeting $BC$ at $G$ and $H,$ respectively: [asy]\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-6, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nD = (0, 0);\nE = (3, 4);\nF = (-3, 4);\nG = (3, 0);\nH = (-3, 0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\ndraw(E--G, dotted);\ndraw(F--H, dotted);\ndraw(D + (-0.4, 0) -- D + (-0.4, 0.4) -- D + (0, 0.4));\ndraw(G + (-0.4, 0) -- G + (-0.4, 0.4) -- G + (0, 0.4));\ndraw(H + (-0.4, 0) -- H + (-0.4, 0.4) -- H + (0, 0.4));\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"$G$\", G, S);\nlabel(\"$H$\", H, S);\n[/asy] Since $DC = 6$ and $AC = 10,$ we have a $3:4:5$ Pythagorean triple and $AD = 8$. Since $\\triangle BFH \\sim \\triangle BAD$ and $BF = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AB$ (since F is the midpoint of AB), we can see that $FH = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AD = 4$ and $BH = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BD = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot BC = 3.$ $HC = BC - BH = 12 - 3 = 9.$\n\nTo find $CF^2,$ we simply use the Pythagorean Theorem: $CF^2 = FH^2 + HC^2 = 16 + 81 = 97.$ By symmetry, we can see that $BE^2 = 97.$ From before, we have that $AD^2 = 8^2 = 64.$ Our answer is therefore $AD^2 + BE^2 + CF^2 = 64 + 97 + 97 = \\boxed{258}.$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many units are in the sum of the lengths of the two longest altitudes in a triangle with sides $8,$ $15,$ and $17$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We recognize 8, 15, and 17 as a Pythagorean triple. Since the hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse is the shortest of the altitudes. The other two altitudes are just the legs themselves, therefore $8 + 15 = \\boxed{23}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The sides of a triangle have lengths of $15$, $20$, and $25$. Find the length of the shortest altitude.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First notice that this is a right triangle, so two of the altitudes are the legs, whose lengths are $15$ and $20$.  The third altitude, whose length is  $x$, is the one drawn to the hypotenuse. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(15)(20) = 150$. Using 25 as the base and $x$ as the altitude, we have $$\n\\frac{1}{2}(25)x = 150, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad\nx = \\frac{300}{25} = \\boxed{12}.\n$$\n\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(15,0)--(0,20)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(9.6,7.2),dashed);\nlabel(\"15\",(7.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"20\",(0,10),W);\nlabel(\"25\",(7.5,10),NE);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(4.8,3.6),N);\n[/asy]\n\n$$\n\\text{OR}\n$$\n\nSince the three right triangles in the figure are similar, $$\n\\frac{x}{15} = \\frac{20}{25}, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad\nx=\\frac{300}{25} = \\boxed{12}.\n$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and a point $K$ on $BC$ such that $AK$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$. If $AC = 10,$ $BK = 7$, and $BC = 13,$ then what is the area of $\\triangle ABC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we sketch! [asy]\npair A, B, C, K;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-7, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nK = (0, 0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--K);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$K$\", K, NE);\nlabel(\"10\", C--A, NE);\nlabel(\"7\", B--K, N);\nlabel(\"13\", B--C, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,K,B,10));\n[/asy] We now see that $CK = BC - BK = 6.$ That means $\\triangle AKC$ is a $3:4:5$ right triangle, so $AK = 8.$ At this point, we can see that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AK \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{52}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,5)$, and $(7,12)$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The base of the triangle lies on the $y$-axis, and is 5 units long. The height of the triangle is the horizontal distance from the point $(7,12)$ to the $y$-axis, and is 7 units long. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{5\\cdot7}{2}=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two sides of an isosceles triangle are 10 inches and 20 inches. If the shortest side of a similar triangle is 50 inches, what is the perimeter of the larger triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First of all, the third side of the smaller triangle cannot be 10 inches because sides of 10, 10 and 20 inches would not form a triangle. The smaller triangle must have sides of 10, 20 and 20 inches. If the shortest side of the similar triangle is 50 inches, then the other two sides are 100 inches and 100 inches. Thus, the perimeter of the larger triangle is $50 + 100 + 100 = \\boxed{250\\text{ inches}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two of the altitudes of the scalene triangle $ABC$ have length $4$ and $12$. If the length of the third altitude is also an integer, what is the biggest it can be?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 4\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 5\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 6\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 7\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{none of these}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Assume we have a scalene triangle $ABC$. Arbitrarily, let $12$ be the height to base $AB$ and $4$ be the height to base $AC$. Due to area equivalences, the base $AC$ must be three times the length of $AB$.\nLet the base $AB$ be $x$, thus making $AC = 3x$. Thus, setting the final height to base $BC$ to $h$, we note that (by area equivalence) $\\frac{BC \\cdot h}{2} = \\frac{3x \\cdot 4}{2} = 6x$. Thus, $h = \\frac{12x}{BC}$. We note that to maximize $h$ we must minimize $BC$. Using the triangle inequality, $BC + AB > AC$, thus $BC + x > 3x$ or $BC > 2x$. The minimum value of $BC$ is $2x$, which would output $h = 6$. However, because $BC$ must be larger than $2x$, the minimum integer height must be $\\boxed{5}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the minimum number of equilateral triangles, of side length 1 unit, needed to cover an equilateral triangle of side length 10 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the sides of the small to big equilateral triangle (note that they are similar) is $1/10$, so the ratio of their areas is $(1/10)^2 = 1/100$. So the big equilateral triangle has 100 times the area of a small one, so it will take $\\boxed{100}$ small triangles to cover the big one.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the triangle so that angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $C$ measures 30 degrees.  Define $D$ to be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to side $AC$.  Because angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $ADB$ is a right angle, triangle $ADB$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Since the length of a leg of a 45-45-90 triangle is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ times the length of the hypotenuse, $AD=BD=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot 6\\sqrt{2}=6$ units.  Also, $CDB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so we can multiply the short leg $BD$ by 2 to find the length of the hypotenuse and by $\\sqrt{3}$ to find the length of the longer leg.  This gives $BC=12$ units and $CD=6\\sqrt{3}$ units.  The sum of the lengths of sides $AC$ and $BC$ is $6+6\\sqrt{3}+12=18+6\\sqrt{3}$.  To the nearest tenth of a unit, this is $\\boxed{28.4}$ units. [asy]\nunitsize(2mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=4;\n\npair A = (0,0), B = (6*sqrt(2),0), C = (3(sqrt(2)+sqrt(6)),3(sqrt(2)+sqrt(6))), D = (3sqrt(2),3sqrt(2));\n\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\n\ndot(dots);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(D--B);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NW);\nlabel(\"$6\\sqrt{2}$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(A+D)/2,NW);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(B+D)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$6\\sqrt{3}$\",(C+D)/2,NW);\nlabel(\"$6\\sqrt{3}$\",(C+D)/2,NW);\nlabel(\"$12$\",(C+B)/2,E);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ such that $AB = AC = 8$ and $BC = 10.$ What is the length of the median $AM$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let's draw a sketch first. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, we know that $AM$ must form a right angle with $BC.$ [asy]\npair A, B, C, M;\nA = (0, 6.24);\nB = (-5, 0);\nC = (5, 0);\nM = 0.5 * B + 0.5 * C;\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--M);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,M,B,10));\n[/asy] We know that $BM = MC = \\frac{BC}{2} = 5.$ Now we just simply apply the Pythagorean Theorem on the right triangle $\\triangle ABM.$ \\begin{align*}\nAM^2 &= AB^2 - BM^2\\\\\nAM^2 &= 8^2 - 5^2 = 39\\\\\nAM &= \\boxed{\\sqrt{39}}\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the sum of the lengths of the $\\textbf{altitudes}$ of a triangle whose side lengths are $10,$ $10,$ and $12$?
