    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $C$ has radius 6 cm. How many square centimeters are in the area of the largest possible inscribed triangle having one side as a diameter of circle $C$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We may consider the diameter of circle $C$ as the base of the inscribed triangle; its length is $12\\text{ cm}$. Then the corresponding height extends from some point on the diameter to some point on the circle $C$. The greatest possible height is a radius of $C$, achieved when the triangle is right isosceles: [asy]\nunitsize(8);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),6));\ndraw(((-6,0)--(6,0)));\nlabel(\"$12$\",(0,0),S);\ndraw(((-6,-0.6)--(-0.6,-0.6)),BeginArrow);\ndraw(((0.6,-0.6)--(6,-0.6)),EndArrow);\ndraw(((-6,0)--(0,6)));\ndraw(((0,6)--(6,0)));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,6)),dashed);\nlabel(\"$6$\",(0,2.5),E);\n[/asy] In this case, the height is $6\\text{ cm}$, so the area of the triangle is $$\\frac 12\\cdot 12\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{36}\\text{ square centimeters}.$$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle with side lengths in the ratio 3:4:5 is inscribed in a circle of radius 3.  What is the area of the triangle? Provide your answer as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the triangle have lengths $3x$, $4x$, and $5x$.  The triangle is a right triangle, so its hypotenuse is a diameter of the circle.  Thus $5x=2\\cdot 3=6$, so $x=6/5$.  The area of the triangle is \\[\n\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 3x\\cdot 4x =\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{18}{5}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}\n=\\frac{216}{25}=\\boxed{8.64}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is inscribed  in a square, then a square is inscribed  in this circle, and finally, a circle is inscribed  in this square. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger square?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the radius of the smaller circle be $r$. Then the side length of the smaller square is $2r$. The radius of the larger circle is half the length of the diagonal of the smaller square, so it is $\\sqrt{2}r$. Hence the larger square has sides of length $2\\sqrt{2}r$. The ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger square is therefore \\[\n\\frac{\\pi r^2}{\\left(2\\sqrt{2}r\\right)^2} =\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{8}}.\n\\]\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),14.1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,14.1)--(14.1,0)--(0,-14.1)--(-14.1,0)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-14.1,14.1)--(14.1,14.1)--(14.1,-14.1)--(-14.1,-14.1)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(-14.1,0),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-7.1,7.1)--(0,0),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{2}r$\",(-6,0),S);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-3.5,3.5),NE);\nlabel(\"$2r$\",(-7.1,7.1),W);\nlabel(\"$2\\sqrt{2}r$\",(0,14.1),N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The dimensions of a triangle are tripled to form a new triangle. If the area of the new triangle is 54 square feet, how many square feet were in the area of the original triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If two similar triangles have side ratios of $r : 1,$ the ratio of their areas must be $r^2 : 1.$ That means that when a triangle is tripled to form a new triangle, the new triangle has 9 times the area of the original. That means the original triangle must have an area of $\\dfrac{54\\text{ ft}^2}{9} = \\boxed{6}\\text{ ft}^2.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is circumscribed about an equilateral triangle with side lengths of $9$ units each.  What is the area of the circle, in square units? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8));\ndraw((0,0)--(4.5,7.794)--(9,0)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((4.5,2.598),5.196));\ndraw((4.5,7.794)--(4.5,0));\ndot((4.5,2.598));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(4.5,2.598),W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(4.5,7.794),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(9,0),E);\nlabel(\"$M$\",(4.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\n\nAbove is the diagram implied by the problem, with some added lines ($O$ is the center of the circle). Since $\\triangle AMB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and $AB=9$, $AM=4.5\\sqrt{3}$. Since $AO$ is $2/3$ of $AM$, $AO=3\\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the area of the circle is $\\pi(3\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{27\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square is inscribed in a circle.  A smaller square has one side coinciding with a side of the larger square and has two vertices on the circle, as shown.  What percent of the area of the larger square is the area of the smaller square?\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1.4142));\ndraw((1,1)--(1,-1)--(-1,-1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0.2,1)--(0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1.4142));\ndraw((1,1)--(1,-1)--(-1,-1)--(-1,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0.2,1)--(0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1.4)--(-0.2,1));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1.4),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0.2,1.4),NE);\ndot((0,0)); dot((0,1.4)); dot((0.2,1.4));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,1.4)--(0.2,1.4)--cycle,red);\n[/asy]\n\nWe label the points as shown.  $A$ is the midpoint of the top side of the square, and $B$ is a vertex of the square.  We look at right triangle $\\triangle OAB$.  We seek a ratio of areas, which remains constant no matter the side lengths, so for simplicity, we let the big square have side length $2$ and the small square have side length $2x$.  Then, $OA=1+2x$, $AB=x$, and $OB$ is a radius of the circle, which has length $\\sqrt{2}$ by 45-45-90 triangles.  Then, the Pythagorean theorem states that $OA^2+AB^2=OB^2$, or \\[(1+2x)^2 + x^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2.\\]   Simplifying the equation yields \\begin{align*}\n& 1+4x+4x^2 + x^2 = 2 \\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow\\ & 5x^2 + 4x-1 =0 \\\\\n\\Longleftrightarrow\\ & (5x-1)(x+1).\n\\end{align*} Thus, $x=-1$ or $x=1/5$.  Lengths are clearly positive, so the valid solution is $x=1/5$.  Then the small square has side length $2x=2/5$, and area $(2/5)^2 = 4/25$.  The large square has area $2^2=4$, so the small square has \\[\\frac{4/25}{4}=1/25=\\boxed{4\\%}\\] the area of the large square.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle and O is the center of its inscribed circle. If the area of the circle is $4\\pi$ sq cm, what is the area, in square centimeters, of triangle ABC? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\nNote: The area of a circle with radius $r$ is $\\pi r^2.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we note that the radius of the inscribed circle is 2 cm (since $\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi$ implies that $r=2$, given that $r$ is nonnegative).\n\nLet $X$ be the midpoint of side $BC$. Thus segment $OX$ is a radius of the inscribed circle: [asy]\nunitsize(16);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2));\ndraw(((-2*sqrt(3),-2)--(2*sqrt(3),-2)--(0,4)--cycle));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,-2)));\ndraw(((-sqrt(3),1)--(0,0)--(sqrt(3),1)));\ndot((0,4)); label(\"A\",(0,4),N);\ndot((-2*sqrt(3),-2)); label(\"B\",(-2*sqrt(3),-2),SW);\ndot((2*sqrt(3),-2)); label(\"C\",(2*sqrt(3),-2),SE);\ndot((0,0)); label(\"O\",(0,0),N);\ndot((0,-2)); label(\"X\",(0,-2),S);\ndot((-sqrt(3),1)); dot((sqrt(3),1));\nlabel(\"2\",(0,-1),E);\n[/asy] Then $COX$ is a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so the sides $OX$, $CX$, and $CO$ are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Since $OX=2$, we have $CX=2\\sqrt 3$.\n\nTriangle $ACX$ is also a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so the sides $CX$, $AX$, and $AC$ are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Thus, $AX=(2\\sqrt3)(\\sqrt 3)=6$.\n\nTriangle $ABC$ has base $BC = 2(XC) = 4\\sqrt 3$ and corresponding height $AX = 6$, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}(4\\sqrt 3)(6) = \\boxed{12\\sqrt 3}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The side lengths of a triangle are 14 cm, 48 cm and 50 cm. How many square centimeters are in the area of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Shrinking the triangle by dividing every side length by 2, we recognize the resulting set $$\\{7,24,25\\}$$ of side lengths as a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the original triangle is also a right triangle, and its legs measure 14 cm and 48 cm.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(14\\text{ cm})(48\\text{ cm})=\\boxed{336}$ square centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangle measures 6 meters by 10 meters. Drawn on each side of the rectangle is a semicircle that has the endpoints of its diameter on the vertices of the rectangle. What percent larger is the area of the large semicircles than the area of the small semicircles? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two large semicircles together make a circle of radius 5, which has area $25\\pi$.  The two small circles together make a circle with radius 3, which has area $9\\pi$.  Therefore, the ratio of the large semicircles' area to the small semicircles' area is $\\frac{25\\pi}{9\\pi} = \\frac{25}{9} \\approx 2.78$.    Since the large semicircles have area 2.78 times the small semicircles, the large semicircles' area is $278\\%$ of the small semicircles' area, which is an increase of $278\\% - 100\\% = \\boxed{178\\%}$ over the small semicircles' area.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Inside a square with side length 10, two congruent equilateral triangles are drawn such that they share one side and each has one vertex on a vertex of the square.  What is the side length of the largest square that can be inscribed in the space inside the square and outside of the triangles?\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F;\nB=(0,0); A=(0,10); D=(10,10); C=(10,0);\nreal x = 5 -5/sqrt(3);\npair E = (x,x); pair F = (10-x, 10-x);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(A--E--C--F--cycle); draw(E--F);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The largest possible square is the square with one vertex on the triangles' coincident vertices and with sides parallel to and coincident with those of the big square.  There are two of them.  We draw them in and label the diagram as shown: [asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F;\nB=(0,0); A=(0,10); D=(10,10); C=(10,0);\nreal x = 5 -5/sqrt(3);\npair E = (x,x); pair F = (10-x, 10-x);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(A--E--C--F--cycle); draw(B--D,dashed);\npair P=(0,x); pair Q=(x,0); draw(P--E--Q);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NE);\nlabel(\"$E$\",E,NNE);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,SSW);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,W);\nlabel(\"$Q$\",Q,S);\ndraw((10,10-x)--(10-x,10-x)--(10-x,10));\ndraw(A--C,dashed); label(\"$M$\",(5,5),W);\n[/asy] First, we find the side length of the equilateral triangle.  $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$; let $MF=x$, so $AM=MC=x\\sqrt{3}$ and $AC=2x\\sqrt{3}$. $AC$ is the diagonal of $ABCD$ and thus has length $10\\sqrt{2}$.  So we have \\[2x\\sqrt{3}=10\\sqrt{2}.\\]  It follows that the side length of the triangle is $2x=\\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nNow, look at diagonal $BD$ and notice that it is made up of twice the diagonal of the small square plus the side length of the triangle.  Let the side length of the small square be $y$, so we have  \\[BD=BE+EF+FD=y\\sqrt{2}+\\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}+y\\sqrt{2}=10\\sqrt{2}.\\]   Solving yields $y\\sqrt{2}=5\\sqrt{2}-\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}$ so $y=\\boxed{5-\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right triangle is inscribed in a circle with a diameter $100$ units long. What is the maximum area of the triangle, in square units?\n\nAnswer:\n",
