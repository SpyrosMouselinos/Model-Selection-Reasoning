    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle whose area is $324\\pi$ square units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that since the area is $\\pi r^2 = 324 \\pi$, where $r$ is the radius, we must have $r=\\sqrt{324}=18$. Thus the distance from the center of the hexagon to a vertex is $18$, and we can break up the hexagon into $6$ equilateral triangles, each of which has side length $18$. The area of an equilateral triangle of side length $s$ is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$, so the area of each equilateral triangle is $81 \\sqrt{3}$, making the total $6(81 \\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{486 \\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square and a circle intersect so that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular hexagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 2 units. In square units, what is the area of the hexagon? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect opposite pairs of vertices of the regular hexagon with line segments as shown.  Since each angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees, the six triangles produced are equilateral.  The diameter of the circle circumscribed around the hexagon is equal to twice the side length of each of the triangles.  Therefore, each triangle has side length 2 units.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ units is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$ square units.  (To show this, divide the equilateral triangle into two smaller 30-60-90 triangles.)  Substituting $s=2$, we find that the area of each triangle is $\\sqrt{3}$ square units.  Therefore, area of the hexagon is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(3.5cm);\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\n\nfor(i=0;i<=5;i=i+1)\n\n{\n\ndot((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\ndraw((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6))--(cos(2*pi*(i+1)/6),sin(2*pi*(i+1)/6)));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\n}\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle has a radius of three inches. The distance from the center of the circle to chord $CD$ is two inches. How many inches long is chord $CD$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Call the center of the circle O, and call the point where the radius of the circle bisects the chord E.  Thus, the line segment from the center of the circle to point E has length 2, and we have $\\triangle ODE$ with a leg of 2 and a hypotenuse of 3.  Thus, the other leg, DE has length $\\sqrt{5}$, and since DE is $\\frac{CD}{2}$, we have $CD = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{5}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is circumscribed about an equilateral triangle with side lengths of $9$ units each.  What is the area of the circle, in square units? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8));\ndraw((0,0)--(4.5,7.794)--(9,0)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((4.5,2.598),5.196));\ndraw((4.5,7.794)--(4.5,0));\ndot((4.5,2.598));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(4.5,2.598),W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(4.5,7.794),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(9,0),E);\nlabel(\"$M$\",(4.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\n\nAbove is the diagram implied by the problem, with some added lines ($O$ is the center of the circle). Since $\\triangle AMB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and $AB=9$, $AM=4.5\\sqrt{3}$. Since $AO$ is $2/3$ of $AM$, $AO=3\\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the area of the circle is $\\pi(3\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{27\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The number of inches in the perimeter of an equilateral triangle equals the number of square inches in the area of its circumscribed circle. What is the radius, in inches, of the circle? Express your answer in terms of pi and in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the triangle have vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, let $O$ be the center of the circle, and let $D$ be the midpoint of $\n\\overline{BC}$. Triangle $COD$ is a $30 - 60 - 90$ degree triangle. If $r$ is the radius of the circle, then the sides of $\\triangle COD$ are $r$, $\\frac{r}{2}$, and $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $6\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\displaystyle\\right)=3r\\sqrt{3}$, and the area of the circle is $\\pi r^{2}$. Thus $3r\\sqrt{3} = \\pi r^{2}$, and $r =\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{\\pi}}$.\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,D,O;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(0,1);\nB=(0.87,-0.5);\nC=(-0.87,-0.5);\nD=(0,-0.5);\ndraw(Circle(O,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(C--O--D--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$\\frac{r}{2}$\",(0,-0.25),E);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}$\",(-0.43,-0.5),S);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-0.43,-0.25),NW);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,N);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle and O is the center of its inscribed circle. If the area of the circle is $4\\pi$ sq cm, what is the area, in square centimeters, of triangle ABC? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\nNote: The area of a circle with radius $r$ is $\\pi r^2.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we note that the radius of the inscribed circle is 2 cm (since $\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi$ implies that $r=2$, given that $r$ is nonnegative).\n\nLet $X$ be the midpoint of side $BC$. Thus segment $OX$ is a radius of the inscribed circle: [asy]\nunitsize(16);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2));\ndraw(((-2*sqrt(3),-2)--(2*sqrt(3),-2)--(0,4)--cycle));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,-2)));\ndraw(((-sqrt(3),1)--(0,0)--(sqrt(3),1)));\ndot((0,4)); label(\"A\",(0,4),N);\ndot((-2*sqrt(3),-2)); label(\"B\",(-2*sqrt(3),-2),SW);\ndot((2*sqrt(3),-2)); label(\"C\",(2*sqrt(3),-2),SE);\ndot((0,0)); label(\"O\",(0,0),N);\ndot((0,-2)); label(\"X\",(0,-2),S);\ndot((-sqrt(3),1)); dot((sqrt(3),1));\nlabel(\"2\",(0,-1),E);\n[/asy] Then $COX$ is a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so the sides $OX$, $CX$, and $CO$ are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Since $OX=2$, we have $CX=2\\sqrt 3$.\n\nTriangle $ACX$ is also a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so the sides $CX$, $AX$, and $AC$ are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Thus, $AX=(2\\sqrt3)(\\sqrt 3)=6$.\n\nTriangle $ABC$ has base $BC = 2(XC) = 4\\sqrt 3$ and corresponding height $AX = 6$, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}(4\\sqrt 3)(6) = \\boxed{12\\sqrt 3}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The region shown is bounded by the arcs of circles having radius 4 units, having a central angle measure of 60 degrees and intersecting at points of tangency. The area of the region can be expressed in the form $a\\sqrt{b}+c\\pi$ square units, where $\\sqrt{b}$ is a radical in simplest form. What is the value of $a + b + c$?\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw(arc((-2,0),2,0,60));\ndraw(arc((0,3.464),2,-60,-120));\ndraw(arc((2,0),2,120,180));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Consider point $A$ at the center of the diagram. Drawing in lines as shown below divides the region into 3 parts with equal areas. Because the full circle around point $A$ is divided into 3 angles of equal measure, each of these angles is 120 degrees in measure.\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D;\nA=(0,1.155);\nB=(0,0);\nC=(-1,1.732);\nD=(1,1.732);\ndraw(arc((-2,0),2,0,60));\ndraw(arc((0,3.464),2,-60,-120));\ndraw(arc((2,0),2,120,180));\ndot(A);\nlabel(\"A\", A, N);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(A--D);\n[/asy] Now consider a circle of radius 4 inscribed inside a regular hexagon:\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-4.619,0);\nB=(-2.309,4);\nC=(2.309,4);\nD=(4.619,0);\nE=(2.309,-4);\nF=(-2.309,-4);\nM=(A+B)/2;\ndraw(circle(O,4));\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\nlabel(\"A\", A, W);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, SE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, E);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SE);\nlabel(\"F\", F, SW);\nlabel(\"M\", M, NW);\ndraw(A--O);\ndraw(B--O);\ndraw(M--O);\nlabel(\"$4$\", 3M/4, NE);\n[/asy] Now, the pieces of area inside the hexagon but outside the circle are identical to the pieces of area the original region was divided into. There were 3 pieces in the original diagram, but there are 6 in the hexagon picture. Thus, the area of the original region is the half the area inside the hexagon but outside the circle.\n\nBecause $ABO$ is equilateral, $BMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, so $BM=\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Thus, the side length of the equilateral triangle is $AB=2BM=\\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Now we know the base $AB$ and the height $MO$ so we can find the area of triangle $ABO$ to be $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot 4=\\frac{16}{\\sqrt{3}}=\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{3}$. The entirety of hexagon $ABCDEF$ can be divided into 6 such triangles, so the area of $ABCDEF$ is $\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 6 = 32\\sqrt{3}$. The area of the circle is $\\pi 4^2=16\\pi$. Thus, the area inside the heagon but outside the circle is $32\\sqrt{3}-16\\pi$. Thus, the area of the original region is $\\frac{32\\sqrt{3}-16\\pi}{2}=16\\sqrt{3}-8\\pi$.\n\nNow we have $a=16$, $b=3$ and $c=-8$. Adding, we get $16+3+(-8)=\\boxed{11}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is inscribed  in a square, then a square is inscribed  in this circle, and finally, a circle is inscribed  in this square. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger square?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the radius of the smaller circle be $r$. Then the side length of the smaller square is $2r$. The radius of the larger circle is half the length of the diagonal of the smaller square, so it is $\\sqrt{2}r$. Hence the larger square has sides of length $2\\sqrt{2}r$. The ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger square is therefore \\[\n\\frac{\\pi r^2}{\\left(2\\sqrt{2}r\\right)^2} =\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{8}}.\n\\]\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),14.1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,14.1)--(14.1,0)--(0,-14.1)--(-14.1,0)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-14.1,14.1)--(14.1,14.1)--(14.1,-14.1)--(-14.1,-14.1)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(-14.1,0),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-7.1,7.1)--(0,0),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{2}r$\",(-6,0),S);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-3.5,3.5),NE);\nlabel(\"$2r$\",(-7.1,7.1),W);\nlabel(\"$2\\sqrt{2}r$\",(0,14.1),N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the figure, circle $O$ has radius 6 units. Chord $CD$ has length 8 units and is parallel to segment $KB$. If $KA$ = 12 units and points $K$, $A$, $O$ and $B$ are collinear, what is the area of triangle $KDC$? Express your answer in simplest radical form. [asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),6));\ndot((0,0));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-6,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(6,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$K$\",(-18,0),W);\ndraw((-18,0)--(6,0));\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-4,sqrt(20)),NW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(4,sqrt(20)),NE);\ndraw((-18,0)--(-4,sqrt(20)));\ndraw((-18,0)--(4,sqrt(20)));\ndraw((-4,sqrt(20))--(4,sqrt(20)));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The center of the circle, $O$, is the midpoint of the chord $AB$ (the diameter of the circle). Since we are told that $CD$ is parallel to $AB$, if we draw a line that is perpendicular to $AB$, it will be perpendicular to $CD$ as well. Now let's draw a segment from $O$ to the midpoint of the chord $CD$, which we will call $X$, and another segment from $O$ to $D$. Now we have right triangle $OXD$ as shown:   [asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),6));\ndot((0,0));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-6,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(6,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$K$\",(-18,0),W);\ndraw((-18,0)--(6,0));\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-4,sqrt(20)),NW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(4,sqrt(20)),NE);\ndraw((-18,0)--(-4,sqrt(20)));\ndraw((-18,0)--(4,sqrt(20)));\ndraw((-4,sqrt(20))--(4,sqrt(20)));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,sqrt(20)),linetype(\"8 8\"));\ndraw((0,0)--(4,sqrt(20)),linetype(\"8 8\"));\nlabel(\"$X$\",(0,6),N);\n[/asy] We are told that chord $CD$ is 8 units long. Since $X$ is the midpoint of chord $CD$, both $CX$ and $XD$ must be 4 units long. We are also told that circle $O$ has a radius of 6 units. This means that $OD$ must be 6 units long. Because we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of $OX$. We get  \\begin{align*}\nOX^{2}+XD^{2}&=OD^{2}\\\\\nOX^{2}&=OD^{2}-XD^{2}\\\\\nOX&=\\sqrt{OD^{2}-XD^{2}}\\\\\nOX&=\\sqrt{6^2-4^2}\\\\\nOX&=\\sqrt{20}.\n\\end{align*} Now let's draw a segment from $D$ to a point $Y$ on segment $KA$ that is perpendicular to both $CD$ and $KA$. We get $DY$, drawn in red in the following diagram:  [asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),6));\ndot((0,0));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-6,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(6,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$K$\",(-18,0),W);\ndraw((-18,0)--(6,0));\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-4,sqrt(20)),NW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(4,sqrt(20)),NE);\ndraw((-18,0)--(-4,sqrt(20)));\ndraw((-18,0)--(4,sqrt(20)));\ndraw((-4,sqrt(20))--(4,sqrt(20)));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,sqrt(20)),linetype(\"8 8\"));\ndraw((0,0)--(4,sqrt(20)),linetype(\"8 8\"));\nlabel(\"$X$\",(0,6),N);\ndraw((4,sqrt(20))--(4,0),rgb(1,0,0));\nlabel(\"$Y$\",(4,0),S);\n[/asy] Since $DY$ forms right triangle $DYO$, which is congruent to $\\triangle OXD$, we get that $DY$ is $\\sqrt{20}$ units long. Now we can use the formula for a triangle, $\\mbox{area}=\\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{base}\\cdot\\mbox{height}$ to get the area of $\\triangle KDC$. We get  \\begin{align*}\n\\mbox{area}&=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot8\\cdot\\sqrt{20}\\\\\n&=4\\cdot\\sqrt{20}\\\\\n&=4\\cdot2\\sqrt{5}\\\\\n&=\\boxed{8\\sqrt{5}}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A chord of length $6$ units divides a circle into two distinct areas.
