    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ is the base of right pyramid $\\allowbreak PABCDEF$.  If $PAD$ is an equilateral triangle with side length 8, then what is the volume of the pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (1,0,0);\ntriple B = (0.5,sqrt(3)/2,0);\ntriple C = (-0.5,sqrt(3)/2,0);\ntriple D = (-1,0,0);\ntriple EE = (-0.5,-sqrt(3)/2,0);\ntriple F = (0.5,-sqrt(3)/2,0);\n\ntriple P = (0,0,1);\n\ndraw(F--A--B--C);\ndraw(C--D--EE--F,dashed);\ndraw(A--P--C);\ndraw(EE--P--D,dashed);\ndraw(B--P--F);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\nlabel(\"$E$\",EE,S);\ndraw(A--D,dashed);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,W);\ndraw(EE--B,dashed);\ndraw(C--F,dashed);\ntriple O = (0,0,0);\ndraw(P--O,dashed);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,S);\n[/asy]\n\nDrawing the long diagonals of a regular hexagon divides the hexagon into equilateral triangles with side length equal to half the length of each long diagonal.  So, the area of the base equals 6 times the area of an equilateral triangle with side length 4.  An equilateral triangle with side length 4 has area $4^2\\sqrt{3}/4 = 4\\sqrt{3}$, so the area of the base of the pyramid is $6(4\\sqrt{3}) = 24\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nLet $O$ be the center of the hexagon, so $\\overline{PO}$ is the altitude from the apex of the pyramid.  Since triangle $PAD$ is an equilateral triangle, triangle $POA$ is a 30-60-90 triangle with hypotenuse 8.  $\\overline{PO}$ is opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle in this triangle, so $PO = 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFinally, the volume of the pyramid is  \\[\\frac13\\cdot [ABCDEF] \\cdot PO = \\frac13\\cdot 24\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 4\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{96}.\\]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two cross sections of a right hexagonal pyramid are obtained by cutting the pyramid with planes parallel to the hexagonal base. The areas of the cross sections are $216\\sqrt{3}$ square feet and $486\\sqrt{3}$ square feet. The two planes are $8$ feet apart. How far from the apex of the pyramid is the larger cross section, in feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the areas of the cross sections is equal to $\\frac{216\\sqrt{3}}{486\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac 49$. Since the ratio of the area of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides, it follows that the ratio of the corresponding sides of the cross-sections is equal to $\\sqrt{\\frac 49} = \\frac 23$.\n\nNow consider the right triangles formed by the apex of the pyramid, the foot of the altitude from the apex to the cross section, and a vertex of the hexagon. It follows that these two right triangles will be similar, since they share an angle at the apex. The ratio of their legs in the cross-section is $2/3$, so it follows that the heights of the right triangles are in the same ratio. Suppose that the larger cross section is $h$ feet away from the apex; then $h - \\frac{2}{3} h = 8$, so $\\frac h3 = 8 \\Longrightarrow h = \\boxed{24}$ feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid is formed on a $6\\times 8$ rectangular base. The four edges joining the apex to the corners of the rectangular base each have length $13$. What is the volume of the pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know the rectangular base of the pyramid has area $48$. To find the volume, we must also determine the height.\n\nLet the rectangular base be $ABCD$. Let the apex of the pyramid be $X$, and let $O$ be the foot of the perpendicular drawn from $X$ to face $ABCD$: [asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport three;\ntriple A = (-3,-4,0);\ntriple B = (-3,4,0);\ntriple C = (3,4,0);\ntriple D = (3,-4,0);\ntriple O = (0,0,0);\ntriple X = (0,0,12);\ndraw(B--C--D--A--B--X--D);\ndraw(X--C); draw(A--X--O--D,dashed);\ndot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(O); dot(X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,W);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,ESE);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,N);\ndraw(O+(X-O)/19.2--O+(X-O)/19.2+(D-O)/8--O+(D-O)/8);\n[/asy] Then by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\begin{align*}\n13^2 &= OX^2+OA^2 = OX^2+OB^2 \\\\\n&= OX^2+OC^2 = OX^2+OD^2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $OA=OB=OC=OD$, so $O$ must be the center of the rectangle (where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet). This is also the point where the diagonals of $ABCD$ bisect each other. Each diagonal of $ABCD$ has length $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$, so we have $OA=OB=OC=OD=5$.\n\nThus $OX=\\sqrt{13^2-OD^2} = \\sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$, and so the height of the pyramid is $12$. The volume is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac 13\\cdot (\\text{area of base})\\cdot (\\text{height}) &= \\frac 13\\cdot 48\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= 16\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{192}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ is the base of pyramid $PABCD$. If $AB = 8$, $BC = 4$, $\\overline{PA}\\perp \\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{PA}\\perp\\overline{AD}$, and $PA = 6$, then what is the volume of $PABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (4,8,0);\ntriple B= (4,0,0);\ntriple C = (0,0,0);\ntriple D = (0,8,0);\ntriple P = (4,8,6);\ndraw(B--P--D--A--B);\ndraw(A--P);\ndraw(C--P, dashed);\ndraw(B--C--D,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\overline{PA}$ is perpendicular to both $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{AD}$, the segment $\\overline{PA}$ is the altitude from the apex to the base of the pyramid.   The area of the base is $[ABCD] = (AB)(BC) = 32$, and the height from the apex to the base is 6, so the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac13(32)(6) = \\boxed{64}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the total area, in square units, of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid that has base edges measuring 6 units and lateral edges measuring 5 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The triangular faces are isosceles triangles.  We drop an altitude from the apex to the base, and, since the triangle is isosceles, it will also be a median.  So it forms a right triangle with hypotenuse $5$ and one leg $3$, and thus the other leg, the altitude, is $4$.  The area of the triangle is then $\\frac{4(6)}{2}=12$.  Since there are $4$ triangular faces, the total area is $4(12)=\\boxed{48}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base that measures 10 cm on each side. Its peak is 12 cm above the center of its base. What is the sum of the lengths of the pyramid's eight edges? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"12\",(6.5,5),E);\n\ndraw((6.6,15)..(6.7,14.9)..(6.8,14.7)--(6.8,5.3)..(6.9,5.2)..(7,5)..(6.9,4.8)..(6.8,4.7)--(6.8,1.8)..(6.7,1.6)..(6.6,1.5),linewidth(.7));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To start, we can draw in a line from where the altitude meets the base to one of the bottom corners as shown:\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(13,3)--(10,0)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6.5,15)--(3,3),linewidth(1));\ndraw((13,3)--(6.5,15)--(10,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,15)--(6.5,1.5),linewidth(1));\ndraw((6.5,1.5)--(10,0),linewidth(.7));\n[/asy]\n\nThe length of this segment will be half the length of the diagonal of the base.  The base has side $10$, so the diagonal will satisfy: $$d^2=10^2+10^2=200$$ $$d=10\\sqrt{2}$$ Half of this is $5\\sqrt{2}$.  Now we can look at the right triangle formed by the altitude from the vertex of the pyramid, the line just drawn in, and with hypotenuse as the edge we need to find the length of.  The length of this edge is: $$\\sqrt{12^2+(5\\sqrt{2})^2}=\\sqrt{144+50}=\\sqrt{194}\\approx 13.928$$ The total length of all edges is: $$4(10)+4(13.928)\\approx \\boxed{ 96}$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A hexagon is inscribed in a circle. Five of the sides have length $81$ and the sixth, denoted by $\\overline{AB}$, has length $31$. Find the sum of the lengths of the three diagonals that can be drawn from $A$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]defaultpen(fontsize(9)); pair A=expi(-pi/2-acos(475/486)), B=expi(-pi/2+acos(475/486)), C=expi(-pi/2+acos(475/486)+acos(7/18)), D=expi(-pi/2+acos(475/486)+2*acos(7/18)), E=expi(-pi/2+acos(475/486)+3*acos(7/18)), F=expi(-pi/2-acos(475/486)-acos(7/18)); draw(unitcircle);draw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);draw(A--C..A--D..A--E); dot(A^^B^^C^^D^^E^^F); label(\"\\(A\\)\",A,(-1,-1));label(\"\\(B\\)\",B,(1,-1));label(\"\\(C\\)\",C,(1,0)); label(\"\\(D\\)\",D,(1,1));label(\"\\(E\\)\",E,(-1,1));label(\"\\(F\\)\",F,(-1,0)); label(\"31\",A/2+B/2,(0.7,1));label(\"81\",B/2+C/2,(0.45,-0.2)); label(\"81\",C/2+D/2,(-1,-1));label(\"81\",D/2+E/2,(0,-1)); label(\"81\",E/2+F/2,(1,-1));label(\"81\",F/2+A/2,(1,1)); label(\"\\(x\\)\",A/2+C/2,(-1,1));label(\"\\(y\\)\",A/2+D/2,(1,-1.5)); label(\"\\(z\\)\",A/2+E/2,(1,0)); [/asy]\nLet $x=AC=BF$, $y=AD=BE$, and $z=AE=BD$.\nPtolemy's Theorem on $ABCD$ gives $81y+31\\cdot 81=xz$, and Ptolemy on $ACDF$ gives $x\\cdot z+81^2=y^2$. Subtracting these equations give $y^2-81y-112\\cdot 81=0$, and from this $y=144$. Ptolemy on $ADEF$ gives $81y+81^2=z^2$, and from this $z=135$. Finally, plugging back into the first equation gives $x=105$, so $x+y+z=105+144+135=\\boxed{384}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of one lateral face of a right pyramid with an equilateral triangular base is 75 square meters. If the slant height is 30 meters, what is the length of the side of its base, in meters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $s$ represent the sidelength of the equilateral triangular base. Each face of the pyramid has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}bh=75$, where $b$ is the sidelength of the base and $h$ is the slant height of 30 meters. We have  $$75=\\frac{1}{2}s(30)=15s.$$So, $s=5$ and the sidelength of the base is $\\boxed{5}$ meters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle PQR$ be a triangle in the plane, and let $S$ be a point outside the plane of $\\triangle PQR$, so that $SPQR$ is a pyramid whose faces are all triangles.\n\nSuppose that every edge of $SPQR$ has length $18$ or $41$, but no face of $SPQR$ is equilateral. Then what is the surface area of $SPQR$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since all edges of pyramid $SPQR$ have length $18$ or $41$, each triangular face must be isosceles: either $18$-$18$-$41$ or $18$-$41$-$41$. But the first of these two sets of side lengths violates the triangle inequality, since $18+18<41$. Therefore, every face of $SPQR$ must have sides of lengths $18,$ $41,$ and $41$.\n\nTo find the area of each face, we draw an $18$-$41$-$41$ triangle with altitude $h$: [asy]\nsize(4cm);\npair a=(0,40); pair b=(-9,0); pair c=(9,0); pair o=(0,0);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); draw(a--b--c--a); draw(a--o,dashed); draw(rightanglemark(a,o,c,60));\nlabel(\"$h$\",(a+2*o)/3,SE);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+c)/2,E);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+c)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$41$\",(a+b)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$9$\",(o+b)/2,N);\n[/asy] Since the triangle is isosceles, we know the altitude bisects the base (as marked above). By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $9^2+h^2=41^2$ and thus $h=40$. So, the triangle has area $\\frac 12\\cdot 18\\cdot 40 = 360$.\n\nThe surface area of pyramid $SPQR$ is made up of four such triangles, so it amounts to $4\\cdot 360 = \\boxed{1440}$.\n\n${\\bf Remark.}$  One might wonder whether a pyramid with the properties enumerated in the problem actually exists. The answer is yes! To form such a pyramid, imagine attaching two $18$-$41$-$41$ triangles (like that in the diagram) along their short edges, so that the triangles are free to rotate around that hinge: [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple a=(9,0,0); triple b=-a; triple c=(0,sqrt(1519),-9); triple d=(0,sqrt(1519),9);\ndot(a); dot(b); dot(c); dot(d);\ndraw(surface(a--b--c--cycle),orange,nolight);\ndraw(b--c--a);\ndraw(surface(a--b--d--cycle),yellow,nolight);\ndraw(b--d--a--b);\ndraw(c--d,dashed);\n[/asy] Now you can adjust the distance between the two \"free\" vertices (the dotted line in the diagram above) so that it is $18$. Adding that edge to the diagram and filling in, we have a pyramid with the desired properties.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rectangle $ABCD$ is the base of pyramid $PABCD$. If $AB = 8$, $BC = 4$, $\\overline{PA}\\perp \\overline{AD}$, $\\overline{PA}\\perp \\overline{AB}$, and $PB = 17$, then what is the volume of $PABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (4,8,0);\ntriple B= (4,0,0);\ntriple C = (0,0,0);\ntriple D = (0,8,0);\ntriple P = (4,8,6);\ndraw(B--P--D--A--B);\ndraw(A--P);\ndraw(C--P, dashed);\ndraw(B--C--D,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\overline{PA}$ is perpendicular to both $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{AD}$, the segment $\\overline{PA}$ is the altitude from the apex to the base of the pyramid.   To find this length, consider right triangle $PAB$.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem gives $PA = \\sqrt{PB^2 - AB^2} = 15$.\n\nThe area of the base is $[ABCD] = (AB)(BC) = 32$, so the volume of the pyramid is $\\frac13(32)(15) = \\boxed{160}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ is the base of the right pyramid $PABCDEF.$  If $PAD$ is an equilateral triangle with side length 6, then what is the sum of the lengths of the edges of the pyramid?\n\nAnswer:\n",
