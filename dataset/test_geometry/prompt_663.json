    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. Given that one edge of the cube is 6 inches, how many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(70);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy] A sphere inscribed in a cube has diameter length equal to the side length of the cube.  Thus, the inscribed sphere has diameter 6 inches, radius $6/2=3$ inches, and volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3)^3=4\\cdot 3^2\\pi=\\boxed{36\\pi}\\] cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. What is the ratio of the volume of the inscribed sphere to the volume of the cube? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(60);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nLet the side length of the cube be $s$.  The side length of the cube is equal to diameter of the inscribed sphere, so the radius of the sphere has length $\\frac{s}{2}$.  Thus, the volume of the sphere is equal to $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{\\pi s^3}{6}$ and the volume of the cube is equal to $s^3$.  Hence the ratio of the sphere's volume to the cube's volume is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube with edge length 9 inches. Then a smaller cube is inscribed in the sphere. How many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed cube? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We draw a diagram:\n\n[asy]\nsize(140);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndot((6,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nThe sphere's diameter length is equal to the big cube's side length, which is 9.\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),9));\ndraw((15,6)..(6,8)..(-3,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((15,6)..(6,4)..(-3,6));\ndot((6,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nNow the sphere's diameter is equal to the space diagonal of the small cube, meaning that the distance between two opposite corners of a cube is equal to the diameter of the sphere.  To compute the space diagonal of the cube, let the side length of the cube be $s$, and label points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ as shown below.\n\n[asy]\nsize(85);\npen dps=linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps);\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(0,0),SW); label(\"$C$\",(9,0),SE); label(\"$D$\",(12,3),NE); label(\"$A$\",(3,3),NW); label(\"$E$\",(12,12),E);\n[/asy] We look at triangle $\\triangle BDE$, where $\\overline{BE}$ is the space diagonal.  $\\overline{DE}$ is a side length of the cube with length $s$. $\\overline{BD}$ is the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with legs length $s$, so its length is $\\sqrt{s^2+s^2}=s\\sqrt{2}$.  So we have \\[BE=\\sqrt{DE^2+BD^2}=\\sqrt{s^2+(s\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{3s^2} = s\\sqrt{3}.\\]Thus, the space diagonal of a cube with side length $s$ has length $s\\sqrt{3}$.  The sphere has diameter 9, which is equal to the space diagonal of the cube, so we have \\[9 = s\\sqrt{3} \\quad\\Rightarrow \\quad s = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}.\\]Finally, the volume of the cube is $s^3 = \\left(\\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^3 = \\boxed{81\\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has a surface area of 216 square centimeters. What is the volume of the cube, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are 6 faces to a cube, meaning that each face has area 36, and the edge has length 6, for a total volume of $6^3 = \\boxed{216}$ for the cube.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the ratio of the volume of a cube with edge length six inches to the volume of a cube with edge length one foot? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each side of the smaller cube is half that of the larger cube, so the ratio of the volumes is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume, in cubic units, of a cube whose surface area is 600 square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The surface area of a cube equals 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces). If the cube has a sidelength of $s$, then the surface area equals $6s^2$. We set that equal to 600 and solve for $s$, which must be positive. $$600=6s^2\\qquad\\Rightarrow 100=s^2\\qquad\\Rightarrow 10=s$$ The volume of the cube is $s^3=10^3=\\boxed{1000}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n There are two concentric spheres of radii 3 units and 6 units. What is the volume, in cubic units, of the region within the larger sphere and not within the smaller sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The smaller one has volume $\\frac43\\cdot27\\pi=36\\pi$ cubic units and the larger one $\\frac43\\cdot216\\pi=288\\pi$ cubic units. The volume between them is the difference of their volumes, or $288\\pi-36\\pi=\\boxed{252\\pi}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is cut into four congruent wedges. The circumference of the sphere is $12\\pi$ inches. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one wedge? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the sphere.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sphere's radius be $r$.  From the sphere's circumference we have $2\\pi r = 12\\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r = 6$.  The volume of the sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6^3) = 36\\cdot 8 \\pi$.  The volume of one wedge is one-fourth this volume, or $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 6^2\\cdot 8 \\pi = 6^2\\cdot 2\\pi = \\boxed{72\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The surface area of a particular sphere is $324\\pi\\text{ cm}^2$. What is the volume, in cubic centimeters, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sphere have radius $r$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has surface area $4\\pi r^2$, so we have \\[324\\pi = 4\\pi r^2.\\]  Solving for $r$ and keeping the positive value yields $r^2=81$, so $r = 9$.  Hence the volume of the sphere is \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(9^3)=81\\cdot 3\\cdot 4 \\pi = \\boxed{972\\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n If the volume of a sphere inscribed in a cube is $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ cubic inches, what is the number of cubic inches in the volume of the cube?\n\nAnswer:\n",
