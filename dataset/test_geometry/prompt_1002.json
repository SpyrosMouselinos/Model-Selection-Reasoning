    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have a triangle $\\triangle ABC$ and a point $K$ on $BC$ such that $AK$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$. If $AC = 10,$ $BK = 7$, and $BC = 13,$ then what is the area of $\\triangle ABC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we sketch! [asy]\npair A, B, C, K;\nA = (0, 8);\nB = (-7, 0);\nC = (6, 0);\nK = (0, 0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--K);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$K$\", K, NE);\nlabel(\"10\", C--A, NE);\nlabel(\"7\", B--K, N);\nlabel(\"13\", B--C, S);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,K,B,10));\n[/asy] We now see that $CK = BC - BK = 6.$ That means $\\triangle AKC$ is a $3:4:5$ right triangle, so $AK = 8.$ At this point, we can see that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot AK \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 8 \\cdot 13 = \\boxed{52}.$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $AB$ parallel to $CD$, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. If the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, what is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(2.5inch);\npair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (-3,4);\nB = (5,4);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (0,0);\nE = intersectionpoint(A--C, B--D);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$E$\", E, N);\n[/asy] We will write the area of triangle $XYZ$ as $[XYZ].$  Since triangles $ADC$ and $BCD$ share a base and have the same altitude length to that base, they have the same area. Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$. Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$. Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \\boxed{98}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$, the parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$ have lengths of 8 and 20 units, respectively, and the altitude is 12 units. Points $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of sides $AD$ and $BC$, respectively. What is the area of quadrilateral $EFCD$ in square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $E$ and $F$ are midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, quadrilateral $EFCD$ is a trapezoid with half the altitude of the original trapezoid (the altitude of trapezoid $EFCD$ is $12/2 = 6$). The length of base $CD$ is still $20$, but now we have to find the length of base $EF$. Since $EF$ connects the midpoints of the legs of the trapezoid, its length is also the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$. Thus, $EF$ has length $\\frac{8+20}{2} = 14$. Finally, we can find the area of the trapezoid with the formula $\\text{Area} = a \\left(\\frac{b_1+b_2}{2}\\right)$ where $a$ is the altitude and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. The area of trapezoid $EFCD $ is $6 \\left(\\frac{14+20}{2}\\right)=6 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{102}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 16$, $AC = 24$, $BC = 19$, and $AD$ is an angle bisector.  Find the ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$.  (Express your answer as a fraction in lowest terms.)\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$ is $BD/CD$.  By the angle bisector theorem, $BD/CD = AB/AC = 16/24 = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In trapezoid $ABCD$ the lengths of the bases $AB$ and $CD$ are 8 and 17 respectively. The legs of the trapezoid are extended beyond $A$ and $B$ to meet at point $E$. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $EAB$ to the area of trapezoid $ABCD$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\npair A,B,C,D,F;\nA = (0,0);\nB = (8,0);\nD = (-4,7);\nC = (13,7);\nF = intersectionpoint(D -- (A + 3*(A-D)), C -- (B + 3*(B-C)));\ndraw(A--F--C--D--A--B);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$E$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,NE);\n[/asy]\n\nTriangles $EAB$ and $EDC$ are similar, and the ratio of their corresponding sides is $\\frac{CD}{AB} = \\frac{17}{8}$. Therefore, we have \\[\\frac{[EDC]}{[EAB]} = \\left(\\frac{17}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{289}{64}.\\]  Since $[EDC] = [EAB] + [ABCD]$, we have $\\frac{[ABCD] + [EAB]}{[EAB]} = \\frac{289}{64}$, so \\[\\frac{[ABCD]}{[EAB]} + 1 = \\frac{289}{64}.\\] Therefore, $\\frac{[ABCD]}{[EAB]} = \\frac{225}{64}$, so $\\frac{[EAB]}{[ABCD]} = \\boxed{\\frac{64}{225}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has sides of length 5, 12 and 13 units, and triangle $DEF$ has sides of length 8, 15 and 17 units. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $DEF$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are both right, since their sides form Pythagorean triples. It follows that the desired ratio is $\\dfrac{(5\\cdot 12)/2}{(8\\cdot 15)/2} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The diameter $AB$ of a circle of radius $2$ is extended to a point $D$ outside the circle so that $BD=3$. Point $E$ is chosen so that $ED=5$ and line $ED$ is perpendicular to line $AD$. Segment $AE$ intersects the circle at a point $C$ between $A$ and $E$. What is the area of $\\triangle  ABC$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{120}{37}\\qquad\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{140}{39}\\qquad\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{145}{39}\\qquad\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{140}{37}\\qquad\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\frac{120}{31}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]  /* Geogebra to Asymptote conversion, documentation at artofproblemsolving.com/Wiki, go to User:Azjps/geogebra */ import graph; size(8.865514650638614cm);  real labelscalefactor = 0.5; /* changes label-to-point distance */ pen dps = linewidth(0.7) + fontsize(10); defaultpen(dps); /* default pen style */  pen dotstyle = black; /* point style */  real xmin = -6.36927122464312, xmax = 11.361758076634109, ymin = -3.789601803155515, ymax = 7.420015026296013;  /* image dimensions */   draw((-2.,0.)--(0.6486486486486486,1.8918918918918919)--(2.,0.)--cycle);   /* draw figures */ draw(circle((0.,0.), 2.));  draw((-2.,0.)--(5.,5.));  draw((5.,5.)--(5.,0.));  draw((5.,0.)--(-2.,0.));  draw((-2.,0.)--(0.6486486486486486,1.8918918918918919));  draw((0.6486486486486486,1.8918918918918919)--(2.,0.));  draw((2.,0.)--(-2.,0.));  draw((2.,0.)--(5.,5.));  draw((0.,0.)--(5.,5.));   /* dots and labels */ dot((0.,0.),dotstyle);  label(\"$O$\", (-0.10330578512396349,-0.39365890308038826), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((-2.,0.),dotstyle);  label(\"$A$\", (-2.2370398196844437,-0.42371149511645134), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((2.,0.),dotstyle);  label(\"$B$\", (2.045454545454548,-0.36360631104432517), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((5.,0.),dotstyle);  label(\"$D$\", (4.900450788880542,-0.42371149511645134), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((5.,5.),dotstyle);  label(\"$E$\", (5.06574004507889,5.15104432757325), NE * labelscalefactor);  dot((0.6486486486486486,1.8918918918918919),linewidth(3.pt) + dotstyle);  label(\"$C$\", (0.48271975957926694,2.100706235912847), NE * labelscalefactor);  clip((xmin,ymin)--(xmin,ymax)--(xmax,ymax)--(xmax,ymin)--cycle);   /* end of picture */ [/asy]\nLet $O$ be the center of the circle. Note that $EC + CA = EA = \\sqrt{AD^2 + DE^2} = \\sqrt{(2+2+3)^2 + 5^2} = \\sqrt{74}$. However, by Power of a Point, $(EC)(EC + CA) = EO^2 - R^2 = (2+3)^2 + 5^2 - 2^2 = 25 + 25 - 4 = 46 \\implies EC = \\frac{46}{\\sqrt{74}}$, so $AC = \\sqrt{74} - \\frac{46}{\\sqrt{74}} = \\frac{28}{\\sqrt{74}}$. Now $BC = \\sqrt{AB^2 - AC^2} = \\sqrt{4^2 - \\frac{28^2}{74}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16 \\cdot 74 - 28^2}{74}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1184 - 784}{74}} = \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{74}}$. Since $\\angle ACB = 90^{\\circ}, [ABC] = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BC \\cdot AC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{74}} \\cdot \\frac{28}{\\sqrt{74}} = \\boxed{\\frac{140}{37}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Square $ABCD$ has area $200$. Point $E$ lies on side $\\overline{BC}$. Points $F$ and $G$ are the midpoints of $\\overline{AE}$ and $\\overline{DE}$, respectively. Given that quadrilateral $BEGF$ has area $34$, what is the area of triangle $GCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We begin by drawing a diagram: [asy]\nsize(5cm);\npair a=(0,1); pair b=(1,1); pair c=(1,0); pair d=(0,0); pair e=(1,.82); pair f=(a+e)/2; pair g=(d+e)/2;\nfill(b--e--g--f--cycle,gray);\nfill(g--c--d--cycle,pink);\ndot(a);dot(b);dot(c);dot(d);dot(e);dot(f);dot(g);\ndraw(a--b--c--d--a);\ndraw(a--e--d);\ndraw(e--g--f--b);\ndraw(g--c);\nlabel(\"$A$\",a,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",b,NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",c,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",d,SW);\nlabel(\"$E$\",e,E);\nlabel(\"$F$\",f,SW);\nlabel(\"$G$\",g,NW);\n[/asy] We know that the gray area above (quadrilateral $BEGF$) has area $34$, and we wish to determine the pink area ($\\triangle GCD$).\n\nFirst we note that $\\triangle AED$ has base $AD$, equal to the side length of square $ABCD$, and also has height equal to the side length of square $ABCD$. Thus $\\triangle AED$ has area equal to half the area of $ABCD$, or $100$.\n\nTriangle $\\triangle FEG$ has half the base and half the height of $\\triangle AED$, so its area is $\\frac12\\cdot\\frac 12\\cdot 100 = 25$.\n\nSince quadrilateral $BEGF$ can be divided into $\\triangle FEG$ and $\\triangle FBE$, we know that $\\triangle FBE$ has area $34-25=9$. This is half the area of $\\triangle ABE$ (which shares an altitude with $\\triangle FBE$ and has twice the corresponding base). Thus, $\\triangle ABE$ has area $18$.\n\nSince square $ABCD$ can be divided into triangles $ABE$, $AED$, and $ECD$, we know that the area of $\\triangle ECD$ is $200-100-18 = 82$. Finally, $\\triangle GCD$ shares an altitude with $\\triangle ECD$ and has half the corresponding base, so the area of $\\triangle GCD$ is $\\frac 12\\cdot 82$, or $\\boxed{41}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $\\angle ABC = 90^\\circ$ and $AD$ is an angle bisector.  If $AB = 90,$ $BC = x$, and $AC = 2x - 6,$ then find the area of $\\triangle ADC$. Round your answer to the nearest integer.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we shall sketch! [asy]\npair A, B, C, D;\nA = (0,90);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (56,0);\nD = (56*90/(90+106),0);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, NE);\nlabel(\"$90$\", (A + B)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (B + C)/2, S);\nlabel(\"$2x-6$\", (A + C)/2, NE);\ndraw(rightanglemark(A,B,C,90));\n[/asy] The first step is to find $x.$ To do this, we simply plug into the Pythagorean Theorem: \\begin{align*}\nAB^2 + BC^2 &= AC^2 \\\\\n90^2 + x^2 &= (2x - 6)^2 \\\\\n8100 + x^2 &= 4x^2 - 24x + 36 \\\\\n0 &= 3x^2 - 24x - 8064 \\\\\n0 &= x^2 - 8x - 2688 \\\\\n0 &= (x - 56)(x + 48).\n\\end{align*} The factorization is a little tricky, especially with a large constant term like $-2688,$ but it helps noticing that $2688$ is close to $52^2 = 2704,$ and the $-8x$ term indicates that our factors that multiply to $-2688$ have to be close. That helps narrow our search greatly.\n\nIn any case, clearly $x = -48$ is extraneous, so we have that $x = 56.$ Therefore, we have $AC = 106$ and $BC = 56.$ (Did you know that $28:45:53$ is a Pythagorean triple?)\n\nNow, to find the area of $\\triangle ADC$ is straightforward. First, clearly the height to base $DC$ is $90,$ so we only really need to find $DC.$ Here we use the Angle Bisector Theorem: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{BD}{DC} &= \\frac{AB}{AC}\\\\\n\\frac{BD}{DC} &= \\frac{90}{106} = \\frac{45}{53}\\\\\n1 + \\frac{BD}{DC} &= 1 + \\frac{45}{53}\\\\\n\\frac{BD + DC}{DC} = \\frac{BC}{DC} &= \\frac{98}{53}\\\\\n\\frac{56}{DC} &= \\frac{98}{53}\\\\\nDC &= \\frac{53}{98} \\cdot 56 = \\frac{212}{7}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nOur area is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 90 \\cdot \\frac{212}{7} = 1362\\frac{6}{7} \\approx \\boxed{1363}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the area of rhombus $ABCD$ given that the radii of the circles circumscribed around triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$ are $12.5$ and $25$, respectively.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The diagonals of the rhombus perpendicularly bisect each other. Call half of diagonal BD $a$ and half of diagonal AC $b$. The length of the four sides of the rhombus is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.\nThe area of any triangle can be expressed as $\\frac{a\\cdot b\\cdot c}{4R}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides and $R$ is the circumradius. Thus, the area of $\\triangle ABD$ is $ab=2a(a^2+b^2)/(4\\cdot12.5)$. Also, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $ab=2b(a^2+b^2)/(4\\cdot25)$. Setting these two expressions equal to each other and simplifying gives $b=2a$. Substitution yields $a=10$ and $b=20$, so the area of the rhombus is $20\\cdot40/2=\\boxed{400}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n We have triangle $\\triangle ABC$ where $AB = AC$ and $AD$ is an altitude. Meanwhile, $E$ is a point on $AC$ such that $AB \\parallel DE.$ If $BC = 12$  and the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $180,$ what is the area of $ABDE$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
