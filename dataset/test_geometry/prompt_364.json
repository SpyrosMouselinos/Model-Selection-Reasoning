    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle in a Cartesian coordinate plane has vertices (5, -2), (10, 5) and (5, 5). How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the given points in a coordinate plane, we find that the triangle is a right triangle whose legs have length $5-(-2)=7$ and $10-5=5$ units.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(7)(5)=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(8));\ndotfactor = 4;\ndraw((-1,0)--(10,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,10),Arrows(4));\npair A=(5,-2), B=(10,5), C=(5,5);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(rotate(90)*\"$5-(-2)$\",(0,0.2)+(A+C)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$10-5$\",(B+C)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$(5,-2)$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$(10,5)$\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"$(5,5)$\",C,NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The diagonal of a particular square is 5 inches.  The diameter of a particular circle is also 5 inches.  By how many square inches is the area of the circle greater than the area of square?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle);\ndraw((2,0)--(0,2));\n\ndraw(circle((4.5,1),1.414));\ndraw((2+3.5,0)--(0+3.5,2));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the side length of the square be $s$, so the area of the square is $s^2$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(75);\ndraw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,2)--(0,2)--cycle);\ndraw((2,0)--(0,2));\nlabel(\"$s$\",(1,0),S); label(\"$s$\",(0,1),W); label(\"$5$\",(1,1),NE);\n[/asy] By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $s^2+s^2=5^2$, so $2s^2=25$ and $s^2=\\frac{25}{2}$, so the area of the square is $\\frac{25}{2}=12.5$.\n\n[asy]\nsize(85);\ndraw(circle((1,1),1.414));\ndraw((2,0)--(0,2));\nlabel(\"$5$\",(1,1),NE);\n[/asy] Since the diameter of the circle is $5$, its radius is $\\frac{5}{2}$, and its area is $\\pi \\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\displaystyle\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{4}\\pi$, which is approximately $19.63$.\n\nThe difference between the two areas is approximately $19.63 - 12.5 = 7.13$, which, to the nearest tenth, is $7.1$.  Thus the area of the circle is greater than the area of the square by $\\boxed{7.1}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square has sides of length 10, and a circle centered at one of its vertices has radius 10.  What is the area of the union of the regions enclosed by the square and the circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The areas of the regions enclosed by the square and the circle are $10^{2}=100$ and $\\pi(10)^{2}= 100\\pi$, respectively. One quarter of the second region is also included in the first, so the area of the union is \\[\n100+ 100\\pi -25\\pi= \\boxed{100+75\\pi}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has vertices at $(-3,2),(6,-2),(3,5)$. How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(200);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nreal x = 7;\npair A=(-3,2), B=(6,-2), C=(3,5);\nfill(A--C--(-3,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(B--C--(6,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(A--B--(-3,-2)--cycle,gray(0.6));\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\nxaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\nyaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(-3,2)$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$(6,-2)$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$(3,5)$\",C,N);\ndraw((-3,5)--(6,5)--(6,-2)--(-3,-2)--cycle,dotted);[/asy] We find the area of the given triangle by subtracting the sum of the areas of the three shaded triangles in the figure from the area of the rectangle formed by all four triangles.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $9(7)=63$ square units, and the sum of the areas of the shaded triangles is $$\\frac{1}{2}(6)(3)+\\frac{1}{2}(3)(7)+\\frac{1}{2}(4)(9)=37.5$$ square units.  The area of the fourth triangle is $63-37.5=\\boxed{25.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is circumscribed about an equilateral triangle with side lengths of $9$ units each.  What is the area of the circle, in square units? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8));\ndraw((0,0)--(4.5,7.794)--(9,0)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((4.5,2.598),5.196));\ndraw((4.5,7.794)--(4.5,0));\ndot((4.5,2.598));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(4.5,2.598),W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(4.5,7.794),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(9,0),E);\nlabel(\"$M$\",(4.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\n\nAbove is the diagram implied by the problem, with some added lines ($O$ is the center of the circle). Since $\\triangle AMB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and $AB=9$, $AM=4.5\\sqrt{3}$. Since $AO$ is $2/3$ of $AM$, $AO=3\\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the area of the circle is $\\pi(3\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{27\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square and four circles, each with a radius of 5 inches, are arranged as shown. What is the area, in square inches, of the square? [asy]\nunitsize(1mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7pt));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(20,0)--(20,20)--(0,20)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((5,5),5));\ndraw(Circle((15,5),5));\ndraw(Circle((5,15),5));\ndraw(Circle((15,15),5));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The side length of the square is equal to twice the diameter of one of the circles, so the area of the square is $(20\\text{ in})(20\\text{ in})=\\boxed{400}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle whose vertices are at $(4, -1)$, $(10, 3)$ and $(4, 5)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$.  Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $B$ has its center at $(-6, 2)$ and a radius of $10$ units. What is the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the two points on circle $B$ that are also on the $y$-axis?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that if the $y$-coordinate of one of the two points is $2+c$, then the $y$-coordinate of the other point must be $2-c$ because the two points must be equidistant from the line $y=2$. Therefore, the sum of the $y$-coordinates of the two points on circle $B$ that are also on the $y$-axis is $\\boxed{4}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(0,5)$, and $(7,12)$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The base of the triangle lies on the $y$-axis, and is 5 units long. The height of the triangle is the horizontal distance from the point $(7,12)$ to the $y$-axis, and is 7 units long. Thus, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{5\\cdot7}{2}=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylinder with a height of 5 inches has a radius of 2 inches. What is the area of the curved surface of the cylinder, in square inches? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The lateral area of a cylinder is $2\\pi rh$. Since $h = 5$ and $r = 2$, our answer is $2\\pi\\cdot 2\\cdot 5 = \\boxed{20\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $A(2,5)$ and $B(10,5)$ are the endpoints of a diameter of a circle graphed in a coordinate plane. How many square units are in the area of the circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nAnswer:\n",
