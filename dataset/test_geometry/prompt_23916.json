    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n There are two concentric spheres of radii 3 units and 6 units. What is the volume, in cubic units, of the region within the larger sphere and not within the smaller sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The smaller one has volume $\\frac43\\cdot27\\pi=36\\pi$ cubic units and the larger one $\\frac43\\cdot216\\pi=288\\pi$ cubic units. The volume between them is the difference of their volumes, or $288\\pi-36\\pi=\\boxed{252\\pi}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is cut into four congruent wedges. The circumference of the sphere is $12\\pi$ inches. What is the number of cubic inches in the volume of one wedge? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\nNote: To measure the circumference, take the largest circle on the surface of the sphere.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sphere's radius be $r$.  From the sphere's circumference we have $2\\pi r = 12\\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r = 6$.  The volume of the sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi (6^3) = 36\\cdot 8 \\pi$.  The volume of one wedge is one-fourth this volume, or $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 6^2\\cdot 8 \\pi = 6^2\\cdot 2\\pi = \\boxed{72\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The interior of a right, circular cone is 8 inches tall with a 2-inch radius at the opening. The interior of the cone is filled with ice cream, and the cone has a hemisphere of ice cream exactly covering the opening of the cone. What is the volume of ice cream? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of the cone is $\\frac13\\cdot4\\pi\\cdot8=\\frac{32}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches, and the volume of the hemisphere is $\\frac23\\cdot8\\pi=\\frac{16}{3}\\pi$. The sum is \\[\n\\left(\\frac{16}{3}+\\frac{32}{3}\\right)\\pi=\\boxed{16\\pi}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. Given that one edge of the cube is 6 inches, how many cubic inches are in the volume of the inscribed sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(70);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy] A sphere inscribed in a cube has diameter length equal to the side length of the cube.  Thus, the inscribed sphere has diameter 6 inches, radius $6/2=3$ inches, and volume \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3)^3=4\\cdot 3^2\\pi=\\boxed{36\\pi}\\] cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A spherical soap bubble lands on a horizontal wet surface and forms a hemisphere of the same volume. Given the radius of the hemisphere is $3\\sqrt[3]{2}$ cm, find the radius of the original bubble.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac43\\pi r^3$, so the volume of a hemisphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac23\\pi r^3$. Therefore if a hemisphere of radius $r$ has the same volume as a sphere of radius $R$, we get $\\frac43\\pi R^3=\\frac23 \\pi r^3$. Simplifying gives $R^3=\\frac12 r^3\\Rightarrow R=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}r$. We know that $r=3\\sqrt[3]{2}$ and that $R$ is the quantity we want to solve for, so substituting in our value of $r$ gives $R=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{2}}\\cdot 3\\sqrt[3]{2}=\\boxed{3}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. What is the ratio of the volume of the inscribed sphere to the volume of the cube? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(60);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nLet the side length of the cube be $s$.  The side length of the cube is equal to diameter of the inscribed sphere, so the radius of the sphere has length $\\frac{s}{2}$.  Thus, the volume of the sphere is equal to $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{\\pi s^3}{6}$ and the volume of the cube is equal to $s^3$.  Hence the ratio of the sphere's volume to the cube's volume is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Joe has exactly enough paint to paint the surface of a cube whose side length is 2.  It turns out that this is also exactly enough paint to paint the surface of a sphere.  If the volume of this sphere is $\\frac{K \\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}$, then what is $K$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the cube has six sides, each of area $2^2 = 4$, the surface area of the cube is 24.  Since Joe's paint will exactly cover the cube and it will also exactly cover the sphere, the sphere also must have surface area 24.\n\nIf $r$ is the radius of the sphere, this tells us that \\[ 4 \\pi r^2 = 24 , \\]or $r^2 = 6/\\pi$, so \\[ r = \\sqrt{6/\\pi} = \\sqrt{6}/\\sqrt{\\pi}. \\]Therefore the volume of the sphere is \\[ \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3 =\\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\Bigl( \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\Bigr)^3 = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi \\cdot \\frac{6 \\sqrt{6}}{\\pi \\sqrt{\\pi}}\n= \\frac{8 \\sqrt{6}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} . \\]Thus $\\boxed{K=8}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone having a diameter of 10cm and a height of 6cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The radius of the base of the cone is $10/2 = 5$, so the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{50 \\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Rose has a spherical plum of radius 2 and a spherical watermelon of radius 8.  She builds a glass sphere around the two fruits to contain them, making the sphere as small as possible.  When she has done this, the volume contained within the sphere, but not in the plum or the watermelon, is $K\\pi$.  What is the value of $K$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
