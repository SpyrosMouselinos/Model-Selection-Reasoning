    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $A(-4,1), B(-1,4)$ and $C(-1,1)$ are the vertices of $\\triangle ABC$. What will be the coordinates of the image of point A if $\\triangle ABC$ is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n When we rotate images $90^{\\circ}$ the coordinates switch places, and the signs are adjusted based on whether or not an axis was crossed. In this case, rotating point $A$ $90^{\\circ}$ will bring it across the $y$-axis into Quadrant I, which means both the $x$ and $y$ will be positive. The original point $A$ was at $(-4, 1)$ so the final image will be at $(1, 4)$. We also could solve this problem by seeing that the slope of the segment from the origin to $A$ is $-1/4$. If $A$ is moving to a location that is a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation about the origin, it will move to a point on the segment perpendicular to the one that currently connects it to the origin. This will be the segment that has a slope of 4/1 or $-4/-1$ from the origin which puts us at $(1, 4)$ or $(-1, -4)$. The point $\\boxed{(1, 4)}$ is in the clockwise direction we need.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ with vertices of $A(6,2)$, $B(2,5)$, and $C(2,2)$ is reflected over the x-axis to triangle $A'B'C'$. This triangle is reflected over the y-axis to triangle $A''B''C''$. What are the coordinates of point $C''$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A reflection over the $x$-axis negates the $y$-coordinate, while a reflection over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coordinate. So reflecting $C$ over the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis means we negate both coordinates to get $\\boxed{(-2, -2)}$ as the coordinates of point $C''$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangles $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle A'B'C'$ lie in the coordinate plane with vertices $A(0,0)$, $B(0,12)$, $C(16,0)$, $A'(24,18)$, $B'(36,18)$, $C'(24,2)$. A rotation of $m$ degrees clockwise around the point $(x,y)$ where $0<m<180$, will transform $\\triangle ABC$ to $\\triangle A'B'C'$. Find $m+x+y$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n After sketching, it is clear a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation is done about $(x,y)$. Looking between $A$ and $A'$, $x+y=18$ and $x-y=24$. Solving gives $(x,y)\\implies(21,-3)$. Thus $90+21-3=\\boxed{108}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Parallelogram $ABCD$ with $A(2,5)$, $B(4,9)$, $C(6,5)$, and $D(4,1)$ is reflected across the $x$-axis to $A'B'C'D'$ and then $A'B'C'D'$ is reflected across the line $y=x+1$ to $A''B''C''D''$. This is done such that $D'$ is the image of $D$, and $D''$ is the image of $D'$. What is the ordered pair of $D''$ in the coordinate plane?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Reflecting a point across the $x$-axis multiplies its $y$-coordinate by $-1$.  Therefore, $D'=(4,-1)$.  To reflect $D'$ across the line $y=x+1$, we first translate both the line and the point down one unit so that the equation of the translated line is $y=x$ and the coordinates of the translated point are $(4,-2)$.  To reflect across $y=x$, we switch the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate to obtain $(-2,4)$.  Translating this point one unit up, we find that $D''=\\boxed{(-2,5)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $ABC$, shown below, $\\cos{C}=\\frac{9\\sqrt{130}}{130}$.  Find $AC$.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(7,0)--(0,9)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));\ndraw(rightanglemark((7,0),(0,0),(0,9),20),black+linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(7,0),E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(0,9),W);\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{130}$\",(7,0)--(0,9),NE);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $\\cos{C}=\\frac{9\\sqrt{130}}{130}$ and $\\cos{C}=\\frac{AC}{BC}$, we have $\\frac{AC}{BC}=\\frac{AC}{\\sqrt{130}}=\\frac{9\\sqrt{130}}{130}$.  This means that $AC=\\frac{9\\sqrt{130}}{130}\\cdot\\sqrt{130}=\\frac{9\\cdot\\sqrt{130}\\cdot\\sqrt{130}}{130}=\\boxed{9}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The points $B(1, 1)$, $I(2, 4)$ and $G(5, 1)$ are plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system to form triangle $BIG$. Triangle $BIG$ is translated five units to the left and two units upward to triangle $B'I'G'$, in such a way that $B'$ is the image of $B$, $I'$ is the image of $I$, and $G'$ is the image of $G$. What is the midpoint of segment $B'G'$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since triangle $B^\\prime I^\\prime G^\\prime$ is translated from triangle $BIG,$ the midpoint of $B^\\prime G ^\\prime $ is the midpoint of $BG$ translated five units left and two units up. The midpoint of $BG$ is at $\\left( \\frac{1+5}{2}, \\frac{1+1}{2} \\right) = (3, 1).$ Thus, the midpoint of $B ^\\prime G ^\\prime$ is at $(3-5,1+2)=\\boxed{(-2,3)}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ with vertices $A(-2, 0)$, $B(1, 4)$ and $C(-3, 2)$ is reflected over the $y$-axis to form triangle $A'B'C'$. What is the length of a segment drawn from $C$ to $C'$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Reflecting a point over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coordinate.  So if $C$ is $(-3,2)$, $C'$ will be $(3,2)$.  The segment is a horizontal line of length $3+3=\\boxed{6}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $T$ has its center at point $T(-2,6)$. Circle $T$ is reflected across the $y$-axis and then translated 8 units down. What are the coordinates of the image of the center of circle $T$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the image is reflected across the $y$-axis first, we will just change the sign of the $x$-coordinate, which will give us $(2, 6)$. Next the image is shifted down 8 units so we will subtract 8 from the $y$-coordinate, giving our image a final center of $\\boxed{(2, -2)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find $\\cos C$ in the right triangle shown below.\n\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C;\nA = (0,0);\nB = (6,0);\nC = (0,8);\ndraw(A--B--C--A);\ndraw(rightanglemark(B,A,C,10));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$10$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$6$\",B/2,S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The Pythagorean Theorem gives us $AC = \\sqrt{BC^2 - AB^2} = \\sqrt{100 - 36} = \\sqrt{64}=8$, so $\\cos C = \\frac{AC}{BC} = \\frac{8}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac45}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The triangle with vertices $A (6, 1)$, $B (4, 1)$ and $C (4, 4)$ is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise about $B$. What are the coordinates of the image of $C$ (the point where $C$ is located after the rotation)? Express your answer as an ordered pair.\n\nAnswer:\n",
