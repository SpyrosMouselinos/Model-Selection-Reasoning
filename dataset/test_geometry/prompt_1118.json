    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The diagram shows a rectangle that has been dissected into nine non-overlapping squares. Given that the width and the height of the rectangle are relatively prime positive integers, find the perimeter of the rectangle.\n[asy]draw((0,0)--(69,0)--(69,61)--(0,61)--(0,0));draw((36,0)--(36,36)--(0,36)); draw((36,33)--(69,33));draw((41,33)--(41,61));draw((25,36)--(25,61)); draw((34,36)--(34,45)--(25,45)); draw((36,36)--(36,38)--(34,38)); draw((36,38)--(41,38)); draw((34,45)--(41,45));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Call the squares' side lengths from smallest to largest $a_1,\\ldots,a_9$, and let $l,w$ represent the dimensions of the rectangle.\nThe picture shows that\\begin{align*} a_1+a_2 &= a_3\\\\ a_1 + a_3 &= a_4\\\\ a_3 + a_4 &= a_5\\\\ a_4 + a_5 &= a_6\\\\ a_2 + a_3 + a_5 &= a_7\\\\ a_2 + a_7 &= a_8\\\\ a_1 + a_4 + a_6 &= a_9\\\\ a_6 + a_9 &= a_7 + a_8.\\end{align*}\nExpressing all terms 3 to 9 in terms of $a_1$ and $a_2$ and substituting their expanded forms into the previous equation will give the expression $5a_1 = 2a_2$.\nWe can guess that $a_1 = 2$. (If we started with $a_1$ odd, the resulting sides would not be integers and we would need to scale up by a factor of $2$ to make them integers; if we started with $a_1 > 2$ even, the resulting dimensions would not be relatively prime and we would need to scale down.) Then solving gives $a_9 = 36$, $a_6=25$, $a_8 = 33$, which gives us $l=61,w=69$. These numbers are relatively prime, as desired. The perimeter is $2(61)+2(69)=\\boxed{260}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the polygon shown, each side is perpendicular to its adjacent sides, and all 28 of the sides are congruent.  The perimeter of the polygon is 56.  Find the area of the polygon.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\ndraw((3,0)--(4,0)--(4,1)--(5,1)--(5,2)--(6,2)--(6,3)--(7,3)--(7,4)--(6,4)--(6,5)--(5,5)--(5,6)--(4,6)--(4,7)--(3,7)--(3,6)--(2,6)--(2,5)--(1,5)--(1,4)--(0,4)--(0,3)--(1,3)--(1,2)--(2,2)--(2,1)--(3,1)--cycle);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can divide the polygon into 25 squares.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\ndraw((3,0)--(4,0));\ndraw((2,1)--(5,1));\ndraw((1,2)--(6,2));\ndraw((0,3)--(7,3));\ndraw((0,4)--(7,4));\ndraw((1,5)--(6,5));\ndraw((2,6)--(5,6));\ndraw((3,7)--(4,7));\ndraw((0,3)--(0,4));\ndraw((1,2)--(1,5));\ndraw((2,1)--(2,6));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,7));\ndraw((4,0)--(4,7));\ndraw((5,1)--(5,6));\ndraw((6,2)--(6,5));\ndraw((7,3)--(7,4));\n[/asy]\n\nLet the side length of each square be $s$.  Then the perimeter of the polygon is $28s = 56$, so $s = 2$.  Hence, the area of the polygon is $25s^2 = \\boxed{100}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the diagram, each of the three identical circles touch the other two.  The circumference of each circle is 36.  What is the perimeter of the shaded region? [asy]\n\ndefaultpen(1);\n\npath p = (1, 0){down}..{-dir(30)}dir(-60){dir(30)}..{dir(-30)}((2, 0) + dir(-120)){-dir(-30)}..{up}(1, 0)--cycle;\nfill(p, gray(0.75));\n\ndraw(unitcircle);\ndraw(shift(2 * dir(-60)) * unitcircle);\ndraw(shift(2) * unitcircle);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Join the centre of each circle to the centre of the other two. Since each circle touches each of the other two, then these line segments pass through the points where the circles touch, and each is of equal length (that is, is equal to twice the length of the radius of one of the circles). [asy]\nimport olympiad;\ndefaultpen(1);\n\npath p = (1, 0){down}..{-dir(30)}dir(-60){dir(30)}..{dir(-30)}((2, 0) + dir(-120)){-dir(-30)}..{up}(1, 0)--cycle;\nfill(p, gray(0.75));\n\ndraw(unitcircle);\ndraw(shift(2 * dir(-60)) * unitcircle);\ndraw(shift(2) * unitcircle);\n\n// Add lines\ndraw((0, 0)--(2, 0)--(2 * dir(-60))--cycle);\n\n// Add ticks\nadd(pathticks((0, 0)--(1, 0), s=4)); add(pathticks((1, 0)--(2, 0), s=4));\nadd(pathticks((0, 0)--dir(-60), s=4)); add(pathticks(dir(-60)--(2 * dir(-60)), s=4));\nadd(pathticks((2 * dir(-60))--(2 * dir(-60) + dir(60)), s=4)); add(pathticks((2, 0)--(2 * dir(-60) + dir(60)), s=4));\n\n[/asy]\n\nSince each of these line segments have equal length, then the triangle that they form is equilateral, and so each of its angles is equal to $60^\\circ$.\n\nNow, the perimeter of the shaded region is equal to the sum of the lengths of the three circular arcs which enclose it.  Each of these arcs is the arc of one of the circles between the points where this circle touches the other two circles.\n\nThus, each arc is a $60^\\circ$ arc of one of the circles (since the radii joining either end of each arc to the centre of its circle form an angle of $60^\\circ$), so each arc is $\\frac{60^\\circ}{360^\\circ} = \\frac{1}{6}$ of the total circumference of the circle, so each arc has length $\\frac{1}{6}(36)=6$.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the shaded region is $3(6) = \\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles right triangle is removed from each corner of a square piece of paper, as shown, to create a rectangle. If $AB = 12$ units, what is the combined area of the four removed triangles, in square units? [asy]\nunitsize(5mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\n\npair A=(1,4), Ap=(0,3), B=(3,0), Bp=(4,1);\n\ndraw((0,0)--(0,4)--(4,4)--(4,0)--cycle);\ndraw(A--Ap--B--Bp--cycle,linetype(\"4 3\"));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each of the sides of the square is divided into two segments by a vertex of the rectangle.  Call the lengths of these two segments $r$ and $s$.  Also, let $C$ be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from $A$ to the side containing the point $B$.  Since $AC=r+s$ and $BC=|r-s|$, \\[\n(r+s)^2+(r-s)^2=12^2,\n\\] from the Pythagorean theorem.  This simplifies to $2r^2+2s^2=144$, since the terms $2rs$ and $-2rs$ sum to 0.  The combined area of the four removed triangles is $\\frac{1}{2}r^2+\\frac{1}{2}s^2+\\frac{1}{2}r^2+\\frac{1}{2}s^2=r^2+s^2$.  From the equation $2r^2+2s^2=144$, this area is $144/2=\\boxed{72}$ square units.

The area of $PQRS$ is $4000$.  What is the length, $x$, rounded off to the nearest integer? [asy]\nreal x = 1; real w = 2/3;\n\n// Draw outer square and labels\npair s = (0, 0); pair r = (2 * x, 0); pair q = (3 * w, x + w); pair p = (0, x + w);\ndraw(s--r--q--p--cycle);\nlabel(\"$S$\", s, SW); label(\"$R$\", r, SE); label(\"$Q$\", q, NE); label(\"$P$\", p, NW);\n\n// Draw other segments\ndraw((x, 0)--(x, w));\ndraw((0, w)--(2 * x, w));\ndraw((w, x + w)--(w, w)); draw((2 * w, x + w)--(2 * w, w));\n\n// length labels\npair upper = (-0.1, x + w);\npair lower = (-0.1, w);\ndraw(lower--upper);\ndraw((-0.1 - 0.03, x + w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, x + w));\ndraw((-0.1 - 0.03, w)--(-0.1 + 0.03, w));\nlabel(\"$x$\", midpoint((-0.1, w)--(-0.1, x + w)), W);\n\npair left = (0, -0.1); pair right = (x, -0.1);\ndraw((0, -0.1 + 0.03)--(0, -0.1 - 0.03));\ndraw((x, -0.1 - 0.03)--(x, -0.1 + 0.03));\ndraw(left--right);\nlabel(\"$x$\", (x/2, -0.1), S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $w$ be the width of each of the identical rectangles. Since $PQ=3w$, $RS=2x$ and $PQ=RS$ (because $PQRS$ is a rectangle), then $2x = 3w$, or $$w=\\frac{2}{3}x.$$ Therefore, the area of each of the five identical rectangles is $$x\\left(\\frac{2}{3}x\\right)=\\frac{2}{3}x^2.$$ Since the area of $PQRS$ is 4000 and it is made up of five of these identical smaller rectangles, then $$5\\left(\\frac{2}{3}x^2\\right)=4000$$ or $$\\frac{10}{3}x^2 = 4000$$ or $x^2 = 1200$ or $x \\approx 34.6$ which, when rounded off to the nearest integer, is $\\boxed{35}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Regions I, II and III are bounded by squares. The perimeter of region I is 12 units and the perimeter of region II is 24 units. What is the ratio of the area of region I to the area of region III? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--(0,0)--cycle,linewidth(2));\ndraw((9,0)--(15,0)--(15,6)--(9,6)--(9,0)--cycle,linewidth(2));\ndraw((9,6)--(12,6)--(12,9)--(9,9)--cycle,linewidth(2));\nlabel(\"III\",(4.5,4.5));\nlabel(\"II\",(12,3));\nlabel(\"I\",(10.5,7.5));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A side of square I has length 3, while a side of square II has length 6 (all sides have equal length).  Therefore, a side of square III has length 9.  Since the side length of square I is $\\frac{1}{3}$ that of square III, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their side lengths, the ratio of the area of square I to square III is $\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9}$.   Alternately, you can just calculate the areas: square I has an area of 9, square III has an area of 81, thus, the ratio of their areas is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the diagram, triangles $ABC$ and $CBD$ are isosceles. The perimeter of $\\triangle CBD$ is $19,$ the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $20,$ and the length of $BD$ is $7.$ What is the length of $AB?$ [asy]\n\nsize(7cm);\ndefaultpen(fontsize(11));\n\npair b = (0, 0);\npair d = 7 * dir(-30);\npair a = 8 * dir(-140);\npair c = 6 * dir(-90);\n\ndraw(a--b--d--c--cycle);\ndraw(b--c);\n\nlabel(\"$y^\\circ$\", a, 2 * (E + NE));\nlabel(\"$y^\\circ$\", b, 2 * (S + SW));\nlabel(\"$x^\\circ$\", b, 2 * (S + SE));\nlabel(\"$x^\\circ$\", d, 2 * (2 * W));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", a, W);\nlabel(\"$B$\", b, N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", d, E);\nlabel(\"$C$\", c, S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In $\\triangle ABC,$ $\\angle ABC=\\angle BAC,$ so $AC=BC.$\n\nIn $\\triangle BCD,$ $\\angle CBD=\\angle CDB,$ so $CD=BC.$\n\nSince the perimeter of $\\triangle CBD$ is $19$ and $BD=7,$ then $7+BC+CD=19$ or $2(BC)=12$ or $BC=6.$\n\nSince the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $20,$ $BC=6,$ and $AC=BC,$ then $AB+6+6=20$ or $AB=8.$\n\nSo our final answer is $\\boxed{8}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the diagram, $\\triangle ABE$, $\\triangle BCE$ and $\\triangle CDE$ are right-angled, with $\\angle AEB=\\angle BEC = \\angle CED = 60^\\circ$, and $AE=24$. [asy]\npair A, B, C, D, E;\nA=(0,20.785);\nB=(0,0);\nC=(9,-5.196);\nD=(13.5,-2.598);\nE=(12,0);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--A);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--E);\nlabel(\"A\", A, N);\nlabel(\"B\", B, W);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SW);\nlabel(\"D\", D, dir(0));\nlabel(\"E\", E, NE);\n[/asy] Find the perimeter of quadrilateral $ABCD.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Recognizing that all our triangles in the diagram are 30-60-90 triangles, we recall that the ratio of the longer leg to the hypotenuse in such a triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, we can see that: \\begin{align*}\nAB & = 24 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = 12\\sqrt{3}\\\\\nBC & = 12 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = 6\\sqrt{3}\\\\\nCD & = 6 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = 3\\sqrt{3}\\\\\nED & = 6 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 3\n\\end{align*} The perimeter of quadrilateral $ABCD$ is equal to $AB+BC+CD+DA$ and $DA=DE+EA$, so the perimeter is $12\\sqrt{3}+6\\sqrt{3}+3\\sqrt{3}+3+24 = \\boxed{27+21\\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the diagram, $\\angle PQR=\\angle PRQ$.  If $QR=5$ and $PR=7$, what is the perimeter of $\\triangle PQR$? [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(2.5,7.43)--(5,0)--cycle);\nlabel(\"5\",(2.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$Q$\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$R$\",(5,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$P$\",(2.5,7.43),N);\nlabel(\"7\",(4.2,3.7));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $\\angle PQR=\\angle PRQ$, then $\\triangle PQR$ is an isosceles triangle and $PQ=PR=7$. Therefore, the perimeter of $\\triangle PQR$ is $PQ+QR+PR=7+5+7=\\boxed{19}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the staircase-shaped region below, all angles that look like right angles are right angles, and each of the eight congruent sides marked with a tick mark have length 1 foot.  If the region has area 53 square feet, what is the number of feet in the perimeter of the region? [asy]\nsize(120);\ndraw((5,7)--(0,7)--(0,0)--(9,0)--(9,3)--(8,3)--(8,4)--(7,4)--(7,5)--(6,5)--(6,6)--(5,6)--cycle);\nlabel(\"9 ft\",(4.5,0),S);\ndraw((7.85,3.5)--(8.15,3.5)); draw((6.85,4.5)--(7.15,4.5)); draw((5.85,5.5)--(6.15,5.5)); draw((4.85,6.5)--(5.15,6.5));\ndraw((8.5,2.85)--(8.5,3.15)); draw((7.5,3.85)--(7.5,4.15)); draw((6.5,4.85)--(6.5,5.15)); draw((5.5,5.85)--(5.5,6.15));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can look at the region as a rectangle with a smaller staircase-shaped region removed from its upper-right corner.  We extend two of its sides to complete the rectangle: [asy]\nsize(120);\ndraw((5,7)--(0,7)--(0,0)--(9,0)--(9,3)--(8,3)--(8,4)--(7,4)--(7,5)--(6,5)--(6,6)--(5,6)--cycle);\ndraw((5,7)--(9,7)--(9,3),dashed);\n[/asy] Dissecting the small staircase, we see it consists of ten 1 ft by 1 ft squares and thus has area 10 square feet. [asy]\nsize(120);\ndraw((5,7)--(0,7)--(0,0)--(9,0)--(9,3)--(8,3)--(8,4)--(7,4)--(7,5)--(6,5)--(6,6)--(5,6)--cycle);\ndraw((5,7)--(9,7)--(9,3),dashed);\ndraw((8,7)--(8,4)--(9,4),dashed); draw((7,7)--(7,5)--(9,5),dashed); draw((6,7)--(6,6)--(9,6),dashed);\n[/asy] Let the height of the rectangle have length $x$ feet, so the area of the rectangle is $9x$ square feet.  Thus we can write the area of the staircase-shaped region as $9x-10$.  Setting this equal to $53$ and solving for $x$ yields $9x-10=53 \\Rightarrow x=7$ feet.\n\nFinally, the perimeter of the region is $7+9+3+5+8\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{32}$ feet.  (Notice how this is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle -- if we shift each horizontal side with length 1 upwards and each vertical side with length 1 rightwards, we get a rectangle.)\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangle with perimeter 176 is divided into five congruent rectangles as shown in the diagram.  What is the perimeter of one of the five congruent rectangles?\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.6 cm);\n\ndraw((0,0)--(6,0)--(6,5)--(0,5)--cycle);\ndraw((0,2)--(6,2));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,2));\ndraw((2,2)--(2,5));\ndraw((4,2)--(4,5));\n[/asy]\n\nAnswer:\n",
