    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the ratio of the volume of a cube with edge length six inches to the volume of a cube with edge length one foot? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each side of the smaller cube is half that of the larger cube, so the ratio of the volumes is $\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^3 = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{8}}.$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When each edge of a cube is increased by $50\\%$, by what percent is the surface area of the cube increased?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $s$ represent the length of the edge of a cube. The surface area of the cube is 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces), or $6s^2$. Increasing $s$ by $50\\%$ gives us $1.5s$. The new surface area is $6(1.5s)^2=6s^2(2.25)$. Increasing the surface area by $x\\%$ is $6s^2\\left(1+\\frac{x}{100}\\right)$, so we solve for $x$ when the surface area is $6s^2(2.25)$. $$2.25=1+\\frac{x}{100}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 1.25=\\frac{x}{100}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 125=x$$ The surface area increases by $\\boxed{125\\%}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A solid box is 15 cm by 10 cm by 8 cm. A new solid is formed by removing a cube 3 cm on a side from each corner of this box. What percent of the original volume is removed?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The total volume of the eight removed cubes is $8\\times 3^{3}=216$ cubic centimeters, and the volume of the original box is $15\\times 10\\times 8 = 1200$ cubic centimeters. Therefore the volume has been reduced by $\\left(\\frac{216}{1200}\\right)(100\\%) = \\boxed{18\\%}. $\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base with side length 10 cm. Its peak is 12 cm above the center of its base. What is the total surface area of the pyramid, in square centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\ndraw(P--C);\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\ndraw(P--F--M,dashed);\ndraw(P--M);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,SW);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base and $M$ be the midpoint of an edge of the square, as shown.  Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFM$ is a right triangle.  We are given $PF = 12$, and we have $FM = (1/2)(AB) = 5$, so the Pythagorean Theorem gives us $PM = \\sqrt{PF^2 + FM^2} = 13$.  Therefore, since the four lateral faces are congruent triangles, the total surface area of the pyramid is \\[[ABCD] + 4[PAB] = 10^2 + 4(13)(10)/2 = \\boxed{360}\\text{ square centimeters}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume, in cubic units, of a cube whose surface area is 600 square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The surface area of a cube equals 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces). If the cube has a sidelength of $s$, then the surface area equals $6s^2$. We set that equal to 600 and solve for $s$, which must be positive. $$600=6s^2\\qquad\\Rightarrow 100=s^2\\qquad\\Rightarrow 10=s$$ The volume of the cube is $s^3=10^3=\\boxed{1000}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An equilateral triangle has sides 8 units long. An equilateral triangle with sides 4 units long is cut off at the top, leaving an isosceles trapezoid. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the trapezoid? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect the midpoints of the sides of the equilateral triangle as shown.  The triangle is divided into four congruent equilateral triangles, and the isosceles trapezoid is made up of 3 of these 4 triangles.  Therefore, the ratio of the area of one of the triangles to the area of the trapezoid is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(12mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=3;\n\ndraw((0,0)--dir(0)--2*dir(0)--dir(60)+(1,0)--dir(60)--cycle);\n\ndraw(dir(60)+(1,0)--dir(0)--dir(60)--2*dir(60)--cycle);\n\ndot((0,0));\ndot(2*dir(0));\ndot(2*dir(60));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two triangles are similar. The ratio of their areas is 1:4. If the height of the smaller triangle is 3 cm, how long is the corresponding height of the larger triangle, in centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If any linear dimension (such as radius, side length, height, etc.) of a closed, two-dimensional figure is multiplied by $k$ while the shape of the figure remains the same, the area of the figure is multiplied by $k^2$.  Since the area is multiplied by 4 in going from the smaller triangle to the larger triangle, we have $k^2=4$ which implies $k=2$.  Therefore, each linear dimension is multiplied by 2, so the height of the larger triangle is $(3\\text{ cm})\\times2=\\boxed{6}$ centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangular prism has dimensions 8 inches by 2 inches by 32 inches. If a cube has the same volume as the prism, what is the surface area of the cube, in square inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cube has volume $8\\cdot2\\cdot32$ cubic inches, so its edge length is $\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot2\\cdot32}=\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot64}=\\sqrt[3]{8}\\sqrt[3]{64}=2\\cdot4=8$ inches.  The surface area of a cube with edge length 8 inches is $6(8\\text{ in.})^2=\\boxed{384}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A wooden model of a square pyramid has a base edge of 12 cm and an altitude of 8 cm. A cut is made parallel to the base of the pyramid that separates it into two pieces: a smaller pyramid and a frustum. Each base edge of the smaller pyramid is 6 cm and its altitude is 4 cm. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of the frustum?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid.  The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/2, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$ of the volume of the original pyramid.  Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/8) = {7/8}$ of the original pyramid.\n\nThe original pyramid has base area $12^2 = 144$ square cm, so its volume is $144\\cdot 8/3 = 48\\cdot 8$ cubic centimeters.  Therefore, the frustum has volume \\[\\frac{7}{8}\\cdot (48\\cdot 8) = 48\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{336}\\text{ cubic centimeters}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cubic block of wood with side lengths of 10 cm is cut into smaller cubes with side lengths of 1 cm. What is the ratio of the surface area of the larger block of wood to the combined surface area of the smaller blocks of wood? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\nAnswer:\n",
