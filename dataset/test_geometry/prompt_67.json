    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A spherical scoop of vanilla ice cream with radius of 2 inches is dropped onto the surface of a dish of hot chocolate sauce. As it melts, the ice cream spreads out uniformly forming a cylindrical region 8 inches in radius. Assuming the density of the ice cream remains constant, how many inches deep is the melted ice cream? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ice cream sphere has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3) = \\frac{32\\pi}{3}$ cubic inches.  Let the height of the cylindrical region be $h$; then, the volume of the cylindrical region is $\\pi (8^2)h=64\\pi h$.  Thus, we have \\[\\frac{32\\pi}{3} = 64\\pi h.\\] Dividing both sides by $64\\pi$ yields $h = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The interior of a right, circular cone is 8 inches tall with a 2-inch radius at the opening. The interior of the cone is filled with ice cream, and the cone has a hemisphere of ice cream exactly covering the opening of the cone. What is the volume of ice cream? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of the cone is $\\frac13\\cdot4\\pi\\cdot8=\\frac{32}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches, and the volume of the hemisphere is $\\frac23\\cdot8\\pi=\\frac{16}{3}\\pi$. The sum is \\[\n\\left(\\frac{16}{3}+\\frac{32}{3}\\right)\\pi=\\boxed{16\\pi}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone has a volume of $12\\pi$ cubic centimeters. The height of the cone is 4 cm. How many centimeters is the circumference of the base of the cone, in terms of $\\pi$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. We're given that the volume is $12\\pi$ and the height is $4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 = 12\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$. Therefore, the circumference of the base is $2\\pi r = \\boxed{6\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A truncated cone has horizontal bases with radii 18 and 2. A sphere is tangent to the top, bottom, and lateral surface of the truncated cone. What is the radius of the sphere?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{DC}$ be parallel diameters of the bottom and top bases, respectively. A great circle of the sphere is tangent to all four sides of trapezoid $ABCD$. Let $E,F$, and $G$ be the points of tangency on $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{BC}$, and $\\overline{CD}$, respectively. Then \\[\nFB= EB= 18 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad FC= GC= 2,\n\\]so $BC=20$. If $H$ is on $\\overline{AB}$ such that $\\angle CHB$ is a right angle, then $HB= 18-2=16.$ Thus \\[\nCH=\\sqrt{20^{2}-16^{2}}=12,\n\\]and the radius of the sphere is $(1/2)(12)=\\boxed{6}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.2cm);\npair A,B,C,D,I,F,G,H;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(36,0);\nI=(18,0);\nH=(20,0);\nD=(16,12);\nC=(20,12);\nG=(18,12);\nF=(21.6,10.8);\ndot(F);\ndot(I);\ndot(G);\ndraw(Circle((18,6),6),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(G--I,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(C--H,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"2\",(19,12),N);\ndraw((20,-2)--(36,-2));\ndraw((18,-4)--(36,-4));\ndraw((20,-2.5)--(20,-1.5));\ndraw((36,-2.5)--(36,-1.5));\ndraw((18,-3.5)--(18,-4.5));\ndraw((36,-3.5)--(36,-4.5));\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 16}\",(28,-2),S);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 18}\",(27,-4),S);\nlabel(\"12\",(20,6),E);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I,S);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny $H$}\",H,SE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,NE);\nlabel(\"$G$\",G,SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,NW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone having a diameter of 10cm and a height of 6cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The radius of the base of the cone is $10/2 = 5$, so the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{50 \\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The truncated right circular cone has a large base radius 8 cm and a small base radius of 4 cm. The height of the truncated cone is 6 cm. How many $\\text{cm}^3$ are in the volume of this solid?  [asy]\n\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\n\ndraw(ellipse((0,0),4,1)); draw(ellipse((0,3),2,1/2));\n\ndraw((-3.97,.1)--(-1.97,3.1)^^(3.97,.1)--(1.97,3.1));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\ndraw(ellipse((0,0),4,1)); draw(ellipse((0,3),2,1/2),gray(.7));\n// draw((-3.97,.1)--(-1.97,3.1)^^(3.97,.1)--(1.97,3.1));\ndraw((-3.97,.1)--(0,6.07)--(3.97,.1));\n\ndraw((4,0)--(0,0)--(0,6.07),linewidth(0.8));\ndraw((2,3)--(0,3),linewidth(0.8));\nlabel(\"4\",(2,3)--(0,3),S);\nlabel(\"8\",(4,0)--(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"6\",(0,0)--(0,3),W);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(0,2)--(0,6.07),W);\n[/asy]\n\nWe \"complete\" the truncated cone by adding a smaller, similar cone atop the cut, forming a large cone.  We don't know the height of the small cone, so call it $x$.  Since the small and large cone are similar, we have $x/4=(x+6)/8$; solving yields $x=6$.  Hence the small cone has radius 4, height 6, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(4^2)(6)=32\\pi$ and the large cone has radius 8, height 12, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(8^2)(12)=256\\pi$.  The frustum's volume is the difference of these two volumes, or $256\\pi-32\\pi=\\boxed{224\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Kadin makes a snowman by stacking snowballs of radius 2 inches, 3 inches, and 5 inches.  Assuming all his snowballs are spherical, what is the total volume of snow he uses, in cubic inches?  Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Thus, the snowballs with radius 2, 3, and 5 inches have volumes $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3)$, $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3^3)$, and $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(5^3)$ cubic inches respectively.  The total volume of snow used is thus  \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3)+\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(3^3)+\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(5^3)&=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3+3^3+5^3)\\\\\n&=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(8+27+125)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{\\frac{640}{3}\\pi}.\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A bottled water company has designed a new cup for its dispenser. The cup will be a right circular cone with a three-inch radius. How tall will the cup need to be to hold 93 cubic inches of water? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\] Therefore, we want $h$ to satisfy \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot h \\ge 93,\\] or \\[h \\ge \\frac{93}{3 \\pi} \\approx 9.87.\\] Therefore, the height must be $\\boxed{10}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream scoop scoops out ice cream spheres with radius 1 inch.
