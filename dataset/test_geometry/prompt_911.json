Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of an equilateral triangle is numerically equal to the length of one of its sides. What is the perimeter of the triangle, in units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$. This must equal $s$. Setting the two equal and solving, we get \\begin{align*}\ns&=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} \\\\\n4s&=s^2\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4 &= s\\sqrt{3} \\\\\n4\\sqrt{3}&= 3s \\\\\n\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} &=s\n\\end{align*} Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is $3s=\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}} \\text{units}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the ratio of the numerical value of the area, in square units, of an equilateral triangle of side length 4 units to the numerical value of its perimeter, in units? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The area of this equilateral triangle is $\\frac{4^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$, and the perimeter is $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$. Thus, the ratio of area to perimeter is $\\frac{\\frac{4^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}}{12}=\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The number of inches in the perimeter of an equilateral triangle equals the number of square inches in the area of its circumscribed circle. What is the radius, in inches, of the circle? Express your answer in terms of pi and in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the triangle have vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, let $O$ be the center of the circle, and let $D$ be the midpoint of $\n\\overline{BC}$. Triangle $COD$ is a $30 - 60 - 90$ degree triangle. If $r$ is the radius of the circle, then the sides of $\\triangle COD$ are $r$, $\\frac{r}{2}$, and $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $6\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\displaystyle\\right)=3r\\sqrt{3}$, and the area of the circle is $\\pi r^{2}$.

An equilateral triangle with sides 4 units long is cut off at the top, leaving an isosceles trapezoid. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller triangle to the area of the trapezoid? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect the midpoints of the sides of the equilateral triangle as shown.  The triangle is divided into four congruent equilateral triangles, and the isosceles trapezoid is made up of 3 of these 4 triangles.  Therefore, the ratio of the area of one of the triangles to the area of the trapezoid is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(12mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=3;\n\ndraw((0,0)--dir(0)--2*dir(0)--dir(60)+(1,0)--dir(60)--cycle);\n\ndraw(dir(60)+(1,0)--dir(0)--dir(60)--2*dir(60)--cycle);\n\ndot((0,0));\ndot(2*dir(0));\ndot(2*dir(60));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle and O is the center of its inscribed circle. If the area of the circle is $4\\pi$ sq cm, what is the area, in square centimeters, of triangle ABC? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\nNote: The area of a circle with radius $r$ is $\\pi r^2.$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, we note that the radius of the inscribed circle is 2 cm (since $\\pi r^2 = 4\\pi$ implies that $r=2$, given that $r$ is nonnegative).\n\nLet $X$ be the midpoint of side $BC$. Thus segment $OX$ is a radius of the inscribed circle: [asy]\nunitsize(16);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2));\ndraw(((-2*sqrt(3),-2)--(2*sqrt(3),-2)--(0,4)--cycle));\ndraw(((0,0)--(0,-2)));\ndraw(((-sqrt(3),1)--(0,0)--(sqrt(3),1)));\ndot((0,4)); label(\"A\",(0,4),N);\ndot((-2*sqrt(3),-2)); label(\"B\",(-2*sqrt(3),-2),SW);\ndot((2*sqrt(3),-2)); label(\"C\",(2*sqrt(3),-2),SE);\ndot((0,0)); label(\"O\",(0,0),N);\ndot((0,-2)); label(\"X\",(0,-2),S);\ndot((-sqrt(3),1)); dot((sqrt(3),1));\nlabel(\"2\",(0,-1),E);\n[/asy] Then $COX$ is a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so the sides $OX$, $CX$, and $CO$ are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Since $OX=2$, we have $CX=2\\sqrt 3$.\n\nTriangle $ACX$ is also a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so the sides $CX$, $AX$, and $AC$ are in the ratio $1:\\sqrt3:2$. Thus, $AX=(2\\sqrt3)(\\sqrt 3)=6$.\n\nTriangle $ABC$ has base $BC = 2(XC) = 4\\sqrt 3$ and corresponding height $AX = 6$, so its area is $\\frac{1}{2}(4\\sqrt 3)(6) = \\boxed{12\\sqrt 3}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An equilateral triangle has an area of $64\\sqrt{3}$ $\\text{cm}^2$. If each side of the triangle is decreased by 4 cm, by how many square centimeters is the area decreased?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We first consider an equilateral triangle with side length $s$. If we construct an altitude, it will divide the equilateral triangle into two congruent $30-60-90$ triangles with the longest side having length $s$ and the altitude opposite the $60^\\circ$ angle. Since the side lengths of a $30-60-90$ triangle are in a $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$ ratio, the altitude will have length $\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Since the base of this equilateral triangle is $s$, its area will be $\\frac{1}{2}{b}{h}=\\frac{1}{2}s \\left(\\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\nNow we can set this expression equal to $64\\sqrt{3}$ and solve for $s$ to find the side length of our original triangle. Doing this, we get that $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}=64\\sqrt{3}$. We can then multiply both sides of the equation by $\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}$ to get that $s^2=256$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $s=16$, so the original triangle had a side length of $16$ cm. If we decrease this by $4$ cm, we get that the new triangle has side length $12$ cm and therefore has an area of $\\frac{144 \\sqrt{3}}{4}=36\\sqrt{3}$ cm. Therefore, the area is decreased by $64\\sqrt{3}-36\\sqrt{3}=\\boxed{28\\sqrt{3}}$ cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $D$ lies on side $AC$ of equilateral triangle $ABC$ such that the measure of angle $DBC$ is $45$ degrees. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ADB$ to the area of triangle $CDB$? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] size(100); defaultpen(linewidth(0.7)); pen f = fontsize(10);\npair A=(0,0),B=(0.5,0.5*3^.5),C=(1,0),D=(1/(2+3^.5),0),E=foot(D,B,C);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(B--D--E);\n\ndraw(rightanglemark(D,E,B,2));\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S,f); label(\"$B$\",B,N,f); label(\"$C$\",C,S,f); label(\"$D$\",D,S,f); label(\"$E$\",E,NE,f); label(\"$60^{\\circ}$\",C,(-1.8,1),f); label(\"$45^{\\circ}$\",B,(0.8,-6.2),f);\n[/asy] Let $s$ be the length of a side of equilateral triangle $ABC$, and let $E$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ to $\\overline{BC}$. It follows that $\\triangle BDE$ is a $45-45-90$ triangle and $\\triangle CDE$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle. It follows that $BE = DE$ and $CE = DE/\\sqrt{3}$, so $$s = BC = BE + EC = DE + DE/\\sqrt{3} = DE \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right).$$It follows that $DE = \\frac{s}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{s}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3} + 1}{\\sqrt{3}}} = \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{1 + \\sqrt{3}},$ so $CE = DE/\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{s}{1+\\sqrt{3}}$ and $CD = 2CE = \\frac{2s}{1+\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nSince triangles $ADB$ and $CDB$ share the same height, it follows that the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases, namely $AD/CD$. Since $AD = s - CD$, then $$\\frac{AD}{CD}= \\frac{s}{CD} - 1 = \\frac{s}{\\frac{2s}{1+\\sqrt{3}}} - 1 = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 1 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}.$$Thus, the ratio of the area of triangle $ADB$ to the area of triangle $CDB$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}- 1}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The triangle shown is an equilateral triangle with side length 12 cm. A side of the triangle is the diameter of the circle. If the sum of the areas of the two small shaded regions in square centimeters in simplest radical form is $a\\pi - b\\sqrt{c}$, what is $a+b+c$?

Also, $\\angle AEB$ cuts off the two arcs $\\widehat{AB}$ and $\\widehat{CD}$, so $m\\angle AEB=(m\\,\\widehat{AB}-m\\,\\widehat{CD}) / 2$.  Subsituting $m\\, \\widehat{AB}=180^\\circ$ and $m\\angle AEB=60^\\circ$ into this equation, we find $m\\,\\widehat{CD}=60^\\circ$.  By symmetry, $\\angle AOC$ and $\\angle DOB$ are congruent, so each one measures $(180-60)/2=60$ degrees.  It follows that $AOC$ and $DOB$ are equilateral triangles.  Therefore, we can find the area of each shaded region by subtracting the area of an equilateral triangle from the area of a sector.\n\nThe area of sector $AOC$ is $\\left(\\frac{m\\angle AOC}{360^\\circ}\\right)\\pi (\\text{radius})^2=\\frac{1}{6}\\pi(6)^2=6\\pi$.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4,$ so the area of triangle $AOC$ is $9\\sqrt{3}$.  In total, the area of the shaded region is $2(6\\pi-9\\sqrt{3})=12\\pi-18\\sqrt{3}.$  Therefore, $(a,b,c)=(12,18,3)$ and $a+b+c=\\boxed{33}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two similar right triangles have areas of 6 square inches and 150 square inches. The length of the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches. What is the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the smaller triangle has hypotenuse 5, we guess that it is a 3-4-5 triangle.  Sure enough, the area of a right triangle with legs of lengths 3 and 4 is $(3)(4)/2 = 6$, so this works.  The area of the larger triangle is $150/6=25$ times the area of the smaller triangle, so its side lengths are $\\sqrt{25} = 5$ times as long as the side lengths of the smaller triangle.  Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the legs of the larger triangle is $5(3+4) = \\boxed{35}$.\n\nProof that the only possibility for the smaller triangle is that it is a 3-4-5 triangle: Let's call the legs of the smaller triangle $a$ and $b$ (with $b$ being the longer leg) and the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle $c$. Similarly, let's call the corresponding legs of the larger triangle $A$ and $B$ and the hypotenuse of the larger triangle $C$. Since the area of the smaller triangle is 6 square inches, we can say  $$\\frac{1}{2}ab=6.$$ Additionally, we are told that the hypotenuse of the smaller triangle is 5 inches, so $c=5$ and $$a^2+b^2=25.$$ Because $\\frac{1}{2}ab=6$, we get $ab=12$ or $a=\\frac{12}{b}$. We can now write the equation in terms of $b$. We get \\begin{align*}\na^2+b^2&=25\\\\\n\\left(\\frac{12}{b}\\right)^{2}+b^2&=25\\\\\n12^2+b^4&=25b^2\\\\\nb^4-25b^2+144&=0.\n\\end{align*} Solving for $b$, we get  $$b^4-25b^2+144=(b-4)(b+4)(b-3)(b+3)=0.$$ Since we said that $b$ is the longer of the two legs, $b=4$ and $a=3$. Therefore, the triangle must be a 3-4-5 right triangle.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the triangle so that angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $C$ measures 30 degrees.  Define $D$ to be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to side $AC$.  Because angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $ADB$ is a right angle, triangle $ADB$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Since the length of a leg of a 45-45-90 triangle is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ times the length of the hypotenuse, $AD=BD=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot 6\\sqrt{2}=6$ units.  Also, $CDB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so we can multiply the short leg $BD$ by 2 to find the length of the hypotenuse and by $\\sqrt{3}$ to find the length of the longer leg.  This gives $BC=12$ units and $CD=6\\sqrt{3}$ units.  The sum of the lengths of sides $AC$ and $BC$ is $6+6\\sqrt{3}+12=18+6\\sqrt{3}$.  To the nearest tenth of a unit, this is $\\boxed{28.4}$ units.
