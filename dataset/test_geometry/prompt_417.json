    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle whose vertices are at $(4, -1)$, $(10, 3)$ and $(4, 5)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$.  Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has vertices at $(-3,2),(6,-2),(3,5)$. How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(200);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nreal x = 7;\npair A=(-3,2), B=(6,-2), C=(3,5);\nfill(A--C--(-3,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(B--C--(6,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(A--B--(-3,-2)--cycle,gray(0.6));\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\nxaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\nyaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(-3,2)$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$(6,-2)$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$(3,5)$\",C,N);\ndraw((-3,5)--(6,5)--(6,-2)--(-3,-2)--cycle,dotted);[/asy] We find the area of the given triangle by subtracting the sum of the areas of the three shaded triangles in the figure from the area of the rectangle formed by all four triangles.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $9(7)=63$ square units, and the sum of the areas of the shaded triangles is $$\\frac{1}{2}(6)(3)+\\frac{1}{2}(3)(7)+\\frac{1}{2}(4)(9)=37.5$$ square units.  The area of the fourth triangle is $63-37.5=\\boxed{25.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of square units in the area of trapezoid ABCD with vertices A(0,0), B(0,-2), C(4,0), and D(4,6)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plot the plots and observe that the bases of the trapezoid are $AB$ and $CD$.  The area of the trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the bases times the height: $\\frac{1}{2}(AB+CD)(AC)=\\frac{1}{2}(2+6)(4)=\\boxed{16}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\npair A=(0,0), B=(0,-2), C=(4,0), D=(4,6);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\nxaxis(-3,8,Arrows(4));\nyaxis(-3,8,Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area of the triangle bounded by the lines $y=x,$ $y=-x,$ and $y=6$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(200); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nxlimits(-8,8); ylimits(-1,10);\nxaxis(Label(\"$x$\"),-8,8,EndArrow(size=5));\nyaxis(Label(\"$y$\"),-2,8,EndArrow(size=5));\ndot(\"$A(6,6)$\",(6,6)); dot(\"$B(-6,6)$\",(-6,6),W); dot(\"$O$\",(0,0),SW);\ndraw((0,0) -- (6,6));\ndraw((0,0) -- (-6,6));\ndraw((-6,6)--(6,6));\n[/asy]\nLet $O = (0,0)$, and let $A$ and $B$ denote the points where $y=6$ intersects $y=x$ and $y=-x,$ respectively. The coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(6, 6)$ and $(-6, 6),$ respectively, so $AB = 6 - (-6) = 12.$ Also, the length of the altitude from $O$ to $AB$ is $6.$ Thus the area of $\\triangle OAB$ is\\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 12 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{36}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many square units are in the area of the parallelogram with vertices at (0, 0), (6, 0), (2, 8) and (8, 8)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The measure of the base of the parallelogram is 6 units and the height of the parallelogram is 8 units.  Therefore, the area of the parallel is $(6)(8)=\\boxed{48}$ square units.

Solving $2x-4=-3x+16$, we get $x=4$.  Substituting $x=4$ back into $y=2x-4$, we find $y=4$.  Therefore, $(4,4)$ is one of the vertices of the triangle.  The other two vertices are the $y$-intercepts of the two lines, namely $(0,16)$ and $(0,-4)$.  Taking the side joining $(0,16)$ and $(0,-4)$ as the base of the triangle, we find that the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(16-(-4))(4)=\\boxed{40}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(3mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.7pt)+fontsize(8pt));\ndotfactor=4;\n\nfill((0,-4)--(0,16)--(4,4)--cycle,gray);\n\ndraw((-2,0)--(5,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-5)--(0,18),Arrows(4));\n\ndraw((0,-4)--(4,4));\ndraw((0,16)--(4,4)); [/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle in a Cartesian coordinate plane has vertices (5, -2), (10, 5) and (5, 5). How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the given points in a coordinate plane, we find that the triangle is a right triangle whose legs have length $5-(-2)=7$ and $10-5=5$ units.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(7)(5)=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(8));\ndotfactor = 4;\ndraw((-1,0)--(10,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,10),Arrows(4));\npair A=(5,-2), B=(10,5), C=(5,5);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(rotate(90)*\"$5-(-2)$\",(0,0.2)+(A+C)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$10-5$\",(B+C)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$(5,-2)$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$(10,5)$\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"$(5,5)$\",C,NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two vertices of an obtuse triangle are $(6,4)$ and $(0,0)$. The third vertex is located on the negative branch of the $x$-axis. What are the coordinates of the third vertex if the area of the triangle is 30 square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that, for a triangle, area = 1/2(base)(height), which equals 30 in this problem. We also know that the height of the triangle is 4 if we use the horizontal leg on the x-axis as the base. Now we can plug this information into the equation to find the length of the base that runs along the x-axis. The equation is $(1/2)(b)(4) = 30$, so $b = 30/2 = 15$. Since the 3rd vertex is on the x-axis we know that it extends straight left 15 units from the vertex at (0, 0), bringing us to the point $\\boxed{(-15, 0)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A quadrilateral in the plane has vertices $(1, 3)$, $(1, 1)$, $(2, 1)$ and $(2006, 2007)$. How many square units is the area of the quadrilateral?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The quadrilateral is shown below: [asy]\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,1)--(2,1)--(10,10.1)--(1,3)--cycle);\ndraw((1,1)--(10,10.1),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", (1,1), S);\nlabel(\"$B$\", (2,1), E);\nlabel(\"$C$\", (10,10.1), N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", (1,3), W);\n[/asy] Divide the quadrilateral into two triangles with the dashed line. We will find the area of these two triangles separately. Since $AB$ is horizontal, the area of triangle $ABC$ is half the product of the length $AB$ multiplied by the length of the vertical altitude from $C$ to line $AB$, or $\\frac{1\\cdot2006}{2}=1003$. Since $AD$ is vertical, the area of triangle $ACD$ is half the product of the length $AD$ multiplied by the length of the horizontal altitude from $C$ to line $AD$, or $\\frac{2\\cdot2005}{2}=2005$. The area of the entire quadrilateral is $1003+2005=\\boxed{3008}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the total area, in square units, of the four triangular faces of a right, square-based pyramid that has base edges measuring 6 units and lateral edges measuring 5 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The triangular faces are isosceles triangles.  We drop an altitude from the apex to the base, and, since the triangle is isosceles, it will also be a median.  So it forms a right triangle with hypotenuse $5$ and one leg $3$, and thus the other leg, the altitude, is $4$.  The area of the triangle is then $\\frac{4(6)}{2}=12$.  Since there are $4$ triangular faces, the total area is $4(12)=\\boxed{48}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of the square with the four vertices at $(-2, 2), (2, -2), (-2, -6)$, and $(-6, -2)$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
