    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid with a square base has total surface area 432 square units.  The area of each triangular face is half the area of the square face. What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $ABCD$ be the base of the pyramid and let $P$ be the pyramid's apex.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport three;\n\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\n\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\n\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\n\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\n\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\n\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\n\ndraw(P--C);\n\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\n\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\n\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\n\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\n\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\n\ndraw(P--F--M,dashed);\n\ndraw(P--M);\n\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\n\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,SW);\n\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base and $M$ be the midpoint of an edge of the square, as shown.  There are four triangular faces, each with area half the area of the square face.  So, the total surface area of the pyramid is 3 times the area of the square face.  Therefore, the area of the square face is $432/3=144$ square units, which means that each side of the square has length 12.\n\nSince the area of the triangle is half the area of the square, we have $(BC)(PM)/2 = 72$, so $(BC)(PM) = 144$, which means $PM = 144/12 = 12$.  Since $F$ is the center of the square base, we have $FM = 6$, so $PF = \\sqrt{12^2 - 6^2} = 6\\sqrt{3}$.  Finally, the volume of the pyramid is \\[\\frac{[ABCD]\\cdot PF}{3} = \\frac{144\\cdot 6\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\boxed{288\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base with side length 10 cm. Its peak is 12 cm above the center of its base. What is the total surface area of the pyramid, in square centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\ndraw(P--C);\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\ndraw(P--F--M,dashed);\ndraw(P--M);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,SW);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base and $M$ be the midpoint of an edge of the square, as shown.  Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFM$ is a right triangle.  We are given $PF = 12$, and we have $FM = (1/2)(AB) = 5$, so the Pythagorean Theorem gives us $PM = \\sqrt{PF^2 + FM^2} = 13$.  Therefore, since the four lateral faces are congruent triangles, the total surface area of the pyramid is \\[[ABCD] + 4[PAB] = 10^2 + 4(13)(10)/2 = \\boxed{360}\\text{ square centimeters}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid is formed on a $6\\times 8$ rectangular base. The four edges joining the apex to the corners of the rectangular base each have length $13$. What is the volume of the pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know the rectangular base of the pyramid has area $48$. To find the volume, we must also determine the height.\n\nLet the rectangular base be $ABCD$. Let the apex of the pyramid be $X$, and let $O$ be the foot of the perpendicular drawn from $X$ to face $ABCD$: [asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport three;\ntriple A = (-3,-4,0);\ntriple B = (-3,4,0);\ntriple C = (3,4,0);\ntriple D = (3,-4,0);\ntriple O = (0,0,0);\ntriple X = (0,0,12);\ndraw(B--C--D--A--B--X--D);\ndraw(X--C); draw(A--X--O--D,dashed);\ndot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(O); dot(X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,W);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,ESE);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,N);\ndraw(O+(X-O)/19.2--O+(X-O)/19.2+(D-O)/8--O+(D-O)/8);\n[/asy] Then by the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\begin{align*}\n13^2 &= OX^2+OA^2 = OX^2+OB^2 \\\\\n&= OX^2+OC^2 = OX^2+OD^2.\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $OA=OB=OC=OD$, so $O$ must be the center of the rectangle (where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet). This is also the point where the diagonals of $ABCD$ bisect each other. Each diagonal of $ABCD$ has length $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$, so we have $OA=OB=OC=OD=5$.\n\nThus $OX=\\sqrt{13^2-OD^2} = \\sqrt{13^2-5^2}=12$, and so the height of the pyramid is $12$. The volume is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac 13\\cdot (\\text{area of base})\\cdot (\\text{height}) &= \\frac 13\\cdot 48\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= 16\\cdot 12 \\\\\n&= \\boxed{192}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A wooden model of a square pyramid has a base edge of 12 cm and an altitude of 8 cm. A cut is made parallel to the base of the pyramid that separates it into two pieces: a smaller pyramid and a frustum. Each base edge of the smaller pyramid is 6 cm and its altitude is 4 cm. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of the frustum?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid.  The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/2, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$ of the volume of the original pyramid.  Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/8) = {7/8}$ of the original pyramid.\n\nThe original pyramid has base area $12^2 = 144$ square cm, so its volume is $144\\cdot 8/3 = 48\\cdot 8$ cubic centimeters.  Therefore, the frustum has volume \\[\\frac{7}{8}\\cdot (48\\cdot 8) = 48\\cdot 7 = \\boxed{336}\\text{ cubic centimeters}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of one lateral face of a right pyramid with an equilateral triangular base is 75 square meters. If the slant height is 30 meters, what is the length of the side of its base, in meters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $s$ represent the sidelength of the equilateral triangular base. Each face of the pyramid has an area of $\\frac{1}{2}bh=75$, where $b$ is the sidelength of the base and $h$ is the slant height of 30 meters. We have  $$75=\\frac{1}{2}s(30)=15s.$$So, $s=5$ and the sidelength of the base is $\\boxed{5}$ meters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base with perimeter 24 inches. Its apex is 9 inches from each of the other vertices. What is the height of the pyramid from its peak to the center of its square base, in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\ndraw(P--C);\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\ndraw(P--F--B,dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base.  Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFB$ is a right triangle.  The perimeter of the base of the pyramid is 24 inches, so the length of each side of the base is $6$ inches.  Since $F$ is the center of the base, $FB$ is half the diagonal of the base, or $(6\\sqrt{2})/2 = 3\\sqrt{2}$ inches.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle $PFB$ gives  \\[PF = \\sqrt{PB^2 - FB^2} = \\sqrt{81 - 18} = \\sqrt{63} = \\boxed{3\\sqrt{7}} \\text{ inches}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square pyramid has a base edge of 32 inches and an altitude of 1 foot. A square pyramid whose altitude is one-fourth of the original altitude is cut away at the apex of the original pyramid. The volume of the remaining frustum is what fractional part of the volume of the original pyramid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The piece that is removed from the original pyramid to create the frustum is itself a square pyramid that is similar to the original pyramid.  The ratio of corresponding side lengths is 1/4, so the piece that was removed has volume $(1/4)^3 = 1/64$ of the volume of the original pyramid.  Therefore, the remaining frustum has volume $1-(1/64) = \\boxed{\\frac{63}{64}}$ of the original pyramid.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A pyramid with volume 40 cubic inches has a rectangular base. If the length of the base is doubled, the width tripled and the height increased by $50\\%$, what is the volume of the new pyramid, in cubic inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the volume of a pyramid is linear in each of length, width, and height (in particular, $V = \\frac{1}{3} lwh$), multiplying any of these dimensions by a scalar multiplies the volume by the same scalar.  So the new volume is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 1.50 = 9$ times the old one, or $\\boxed{360}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has a surface area of 216 square centimeters. What is the volume of the cube, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are 6 faces to a cube, meaning that each face has area 36, and the edge has length 6, for a total volume of $6^3 = \\boxed{216}$ for the cube.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base with area 288 square cm. Its peak is 15 cm from each of the other vertices. What is the volume of the pyramid, in cubic centimeters?\n\nAnswer:\n",
