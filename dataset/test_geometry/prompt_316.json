    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n On an old-fashioned bicycle the front wheel has a radius of $2.5$ feet and the back wheel has a radius of $4$ inches.  If there is no slippage, how many revolutions will the back wheel make while the front wheel makes $100$ revolutions?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The circumference of the front wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot 2.5=5\\pi$ feet. In 100 revolutions, the front wheel travels $5\\pi \\cdot 100 = 500\\pi$ feet. The back wheel must travel the same distance because they are both attached to the same bike. The circumference of the back wheel is $2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi$ feet (note that 4 inches is equal to $\\frac{1}{3}$ feet). Thus, the number of revolutions of the back wheel is $\\frac{500\\pi}{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi}=\\boxed{750}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of degrees in the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n[asy]\nsize(200);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),5),linewidth(1.2));\npair[] mins;\nfor(int i = 0; i < 60; ++i){\n\nmins[i] = 4.5*dir(-6*i + 90);\n\ndot(mins[i]);\n}\nfor(int i = 1; i <= 12; ++i){\n\nlabel((string)i,mins[5*i % 60],dir(-30*i - 90));\n}\n\nfill(Circle((0,0),0.25));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two angles of a triangle measure 30 and 45 degrees. If the side of the triangle opposite the 30-degree angle measures $6\\sqrt2$ units, what is the sum of the lengths of the two remaining sides? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the triangle so that angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $C$ measures 30 degrees.  Define $D$ to be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to side $AC$.  Because angle $A$ measures 45 degrees and angle $ADB$ is a right angle, triangle $ADB$ is a 45-45-90 triangle.  Since the length of a leg of a 45-45-90 triangle is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ times the length of the hypotenuse, $AD=BD=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot 6\\sqrt{2}=6$ units.  Also, $CDB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so we can multiply the short leg $BD$ by 2 to find the length of the hypotenuse and by $\\sqrt{3}$ to find the length of the longer leg.  This gives $BC=12$ units and $CD=6\\sqrt{3}$ units.  The sum of the lengths of sides $AC$ and $BC$ is $6+6\\sqrt{3}+12=18+6\\sqrt{3}$.  To the nearest tenth of a unit, this is $\\boxed{28.4}$ units.

Let $E$ be a point on the circle, and let the tangent at $B$ intersect the tangent at $E$ and $AE$ at $C$ and $D$, respectively.  If $\\angle BAE = 43^\\circ$, find $\\angle CED$, in degrees.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph;\n\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair O, A, B, C, D, E;\n\nO = (0,0);\nA = (0,1);\nB = (0,-1);\nE = dir(-6);\nD = extension(A,E,B,B + rotate(90)*(B));\nC = extension(E,E + rotate(90)*(E),B,B + rotate(90)*(B));\n\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\ndraw(B--A--D--cycle);\ndraw(B--E--C);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, S);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, S);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, SE);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, dir(0));\ndot(\"$O$\", O, W);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Both angles $\\angle BAD$ and $\\angle CBE$ subtend arc $BE$, so $\\angle CBE = \\angle BAE = 43^\\circ$.  Triangle $BCE$ is isosceles with $BC = CE$, since these are tangent from the same point to the same circle, so $\\angle CEB = \\angle CBE = 43^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, $\\angle AEB = 90^\\circ$ since $AB$ is a diameter, so $\\angle BED = 90^\\circ$.  Therefore, $\\angle CED = \\angle BED - \\angle BEC = 90^\\circ - 43^\\circ = \\boxed{47^\\circ}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The second hand on the clock pictured below is 6 cm long.  How far in centimeters does the tip of this second hand travel during a period of 30 minutes? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),20));\nlabel(\"12\",(0,20),S);\nlabel(\"9\",(-20,0),E);\nlabel(\"6\",(0,-20),N);\nlabel(\"3\",(20,0),W);\ndot((0,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(12,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(-8,10));\ndraw((0,0)--(-11,-14),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"6cm\",(-5.5,-7),SE);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In 30 minutes, the tip of the second hand travels 30 times around the circumference of a circle of radius 6cm. Since the circumference is $2\\pi \\cdot6 = 12\\pi$, the tip of the second hand travels $12\\pi \\cdot 30 = \\boxed{360\\pi}$ centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measure of angle $ACB$ is 40 degrees. If ray $CA$ is rotated 480 degrees about point $C$ in a clockwise direction, what will be the positive measure of the new acute angle $ACB$, in degrees?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--dir(40),linewidth(1),Arrow);\ndraw((0,0)--dir(0),linewidth(1),Arrow);\ndot(.8dir(40));\ndot(.8dir(0));\ndot((0,0));\nlabel(\"A\",.8dir(40),NW);\nlabel(\"B\",.8dir(0),S);\nlabel(\"C\",(0,0),W);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A rotation by 480 degrees is the same as one by $480 - 360 = 120$.  The first $40$ degrees of this rotation will be used to decrease the angle $ACB$ to $0$ degrees, leaving $80$ unused degrees, so our answer is $\\boxed{80}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is circumscribed around $ABCD$ as follows: [asy]\npair pA, pB, pC, pD, pO;\npO = (0, 0);\npA = pO + dir(-40);\npB = pO + dir(40);\npC = pO + dir(130);\npD = pO + dir(190);\ndraw(pA--pB--pC--pA);\ndraw(pA--pD--pC--pA);\nlabel(\"$A$\", pA, SE);\nlabel(\"$B$\", pB, NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\", pC, NW);\nlabel(\"$D$\", pD, SW);\ndraw(circle(pO, 1));\nlabel(\"$30^\\circ$\", pA + dir(150) * .45);\nlabel(\"$40^\\circ$\", pC + dir(-20) * .35);\n[/asy] How many degrees are in $\\angle CAB + \\angle ACD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can see that $\\angle ACB = 40^\\circ$ must be half of the central angle formed by the arc ${AB},$ or $80^\\circ.$ Likewise, $\\angle CAD = 30^\\circ$ must be half of the central angle formed by the arc ${CD},$ or $60^\\circ.$ Then, we can see that the angles formed by arcs ${BC}$ and ${DA}$ must sum to $360^\\circ - (80^\\circ + 60^\\circ) = 220^\\circ.$ That means the sum $\\angle CAB + \\angle ACD$ must be half of that, or $\\boxed{110^\\circ}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Carla rotated point $A$ 420 degrees clockwise about point $B$ and it landed at point $C$. Devon rotated the original point $A$ $x$ degrees counterclockwise about point $B$ and it also landed at point $C$. If $x<360$, what is the value of $x$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Carla's rotation was equivalent to one of $60^{\\circ}$ clockwise. To get to the same point by going counter-clockwise, we have to go $360^{\\circ}$ minus Carla's rotation, or $\\boxed{300^{\\circ}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AX = XY = YB = BC$ and the measure of angle $ABC$ is 120 degrees. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$?\n\n[asy]\npair A,X,Y,B,C;\nX = A + dir(30); Y = X + dir(0); B = Y + dir(60); C = B + dir(-30);\ndraw(B--Y--X--B--C--A--X);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$X$\",X,NW); label(\"$Y$\",Y,S); label(\"$B$\",B,N); label(\"$C$\",C,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $t$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $BAC$ (which is what we want to compute).\n\nSince $AX=XY$, we have $\\angle AYX = \\angle YAX = \\angle BAC = t^\\circ$. Then, since the sum of angles in $\\triangle AXY$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle AXY = (180-2t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AXY$ and $\\angle BXY$ add to form a straight angle, so they are supplementary; $\\angle BXY = (180-(180-2t))^\\circ = (2t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $XY=YB$, we have $\\angle XBY = \\angle BXY = (2t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle XYB$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle XYB = (180-4t)^\\circ$.\n\nAngles $\\angle AYX$, $\\angle XYB$, and $\\angle BYC$ add to form a straight angle, so their sum is $180^\\circ$. Therefore, $\\angle BYC = (180-t-(180-4t))^\\circ = (3t)^\\circ$.\n\nSince $YB=BC$, we have $\\angle YCB = \\angle BYC = (3t)^\\circ$. Since the sum of angles in $\\triangle YBC$ is $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle YBC = (180-6t)^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, $\\angle ABC = \\angle XBY + \\angle YBC = (2t)^\\circ + (180-6t)^\\circ = (180-4t)^\\circ$. We know this is equal to $120^\\circ$, so we solve the equation $$180-4t = 120$$ to obtain $t=\\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In an isosceles triangle, one of the angles opposite an equal side is $40^{\\circ}$. How many degrees are in the measure of the triangle's largest angle? [asy] draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(3,2)--(0,0)); label(\"$\\backslash$\",(1.5,1)); label(\"{/}\",(4.5,1));\nlabel(\"$40^{\\circ}$\",(.5,0),dir(45));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two angles opposite the equal sides of an isosceles triangle are congruent, so in this case, both are $40^\\circ$. Since the three angles of a triangle add up to $180^\\circ$, the third angle in this triangle is $(180-40-40)^\\circ = \\boxed{100}^\\circ$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n At a driver education class, the students were told to put their hands on the steering wheel on \"$3$'' and \"$9$'', just as on the face of a clock. If, instead, the students placed their hands on the \"$2$'' and the \"$10$'', by how many degrees would the angle between the hands (with the center of the wheel at the vertex of the angle) decrease?\n\nAnswer:\n",
