    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 22, AC=12,$ and $BC=14$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=24$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24\\cdot 2\\cdot 12\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 24\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$24\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 24,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 9$, $BC = 12$, $AC = 15$, and $CD$ is the angle bisector.  Find the length of $CD$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n $\\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle, since $9^2 + 12^2 = 15^2$. Thus, $\\angle ABC = 90^\\circ$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D;\n\nA = (0,9);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (12,0);\nD = (0,4);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--D);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, W);\n[/asy]\n\nBy the angle bisector theorem, $BD/AD = BC/AC$, so \\[BD = \\frac{BC}{BC + AC} \\cdot AB = \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot 9 = 4.\\] Then by use of the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $BCD$, $CD = \\sqrt{BC^2 + BD^2} = \\sqrt{12^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{160} = \\boxed{4 \\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $BC = 20 \\sqrt{3}$ and $\\angle C = 30^\\circ$.  Let the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ intersect $BC$ and $AC$ at $D$ and $E$, respectively.  Find the length of $DE$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We have that $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, and that $CD = BC/2 = 20 \\sqrt{3}/2 = 10 \\sqrt{3}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E;\n\nA = dir(133);\nB = dir(193);\nC = dir(-13);\nD = (B + C)/2;\nE = extension(A, C, D, D + rotate(90)*(B - C));\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(D--E);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\n[/asy]\n\nAlso, triangle $CED$ is a $30^\\circ$-$60^\\circ$-$90^\\circ$ triangle, so $DE = CD/\\sqrt{3} = 10 \\sqrt{3}/\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{10}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = AC=7$ and $BC=6$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=10$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{10\\cdot 3\\cdot 3\\cdot 4} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 10,$$ which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{10}}{5}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has positive integer side lengths with $AB=AC$. Let $I$ be the intersection of the bisectors of $\\angle B$ and $\\angle C$. Suppose $BI=8$. Find the smallest possible perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $D$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$. Then by SAS Congruence, $\\triangle ABD \\cong \\triangle ACD$, so $\\angle ADB = \\angle ADC = 90^o$.\nNow let $BD=y$, $AB=x$, and $\\angle IBD = \\dfrac{\\angle ABD}{2} = \\theta$.\nThen $\\mathrm{cos}{(\\theta)} = \\dfrac{y}{8}$\nand $\\mathrm{cos}{(2\\theta)} = \\dfrac{y}{x} = 2\\mathrm{cos^2}{(\\theta)} - 1 = \\dfrac{y^2-32}{32}$.\nCross-multiplying yields $32y = x(y^2-32)$.\nSince $x,y>0$, $y^2-32$ must be positive, so $y > 5.5$.\nAdditionally, since $\\triangle IBD$ has hypotenuse $\\overline{IB}$ of length $8$, $BD=y < 8$.\nTherefore, given that $BC=2y$ is an integer, the only possible values for $y$ are $6$, $6.5$, $7$, and $7.5$.\nHowever, only one of these values, $y=6$, yields an integral value for $AB=x$, so we conclude that $y=6$ and $x=\\dfrac{32(6)}{(6)^2-32}=48$.\nThus the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ must be $2(x+y) = \\boxed{108}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the diameter of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 11,$ $AC=6,$ and $BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $d$ be the diameter of the inscribed circle, and let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=12$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{12\\cdot 1\\cdot 6\\cdot 5} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{6^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 12,$$which yields the radius $r=\\frac {\\sqrt{10}}{2}$. This yields the diameter $d = \\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 16$, $AC = 24$, $BC = 19$, and $AD$ is an angle bisector.  Find the ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$.  (Express your answer as a fraction in lowest terms.)\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$ is $BD/CD$.  By the angle bisector theorem, $BD/CD = AB/AC = 16/24 = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with legs $AB$ and $AC$. Points $X$ and $Y$ lie on legs $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, so that $AX:XB = AY:YC = 1:2$. If $BY = 16$ units, and $CX = 28$ units, what is the length of hypotenuse $BC$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $AB = x$ and $AC = y$. Then we can write two Pythagorean equations from the information given: $(x/3)^2 + y^2 = 28^2$ and $x^2 + (y/3)^2 = 16^2$. These equations become $x^2/9 + y^2 = 784$ and $x^2 + y^2/9 = 256$. Multiplying them both by 9, we get $x^2 + 9y^2= 7056$ and $9x^2 + y^2\n= 2304$. Now we add the two equations to get $10x^2 + 10y^2 = 9360$, which can be reduced to $x^2\n+ y^2 = 936$. We do not need to solve for $x$ and $y$ since 936 is the square of the hypotenuse $BC$. The length is thus $\\sqrt{936} = \\sqrt{(36 \\times 26)} = \\sqrt{36} \\times \\sqrt{26} = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{26}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 5, AC=6, BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=9$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{9\\cdot 4\\cdot 3\\cdot 2} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{3^3\\cdot 2^3} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{6}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{6} = r\\cdot 9,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right triangle has a side length of 21 inches and a hypotenuse of 29 inches. A second triangle is similar to the first and has a hypotenuse of 87 inches. What is the length of the shortest side of the second triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we calculate that the other leg of the original right triangle must be $$\\sqrt{29^2 - 21^2} = \\sqrt{841 - 441} = \\sqrt{400} = 20$$ inches. Since 87 is 3 times 29, the length of the shortest side of the second triangle must be $3 \\times 20 = \\boxed{60\\text{ inches}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $\\triangle ABC,$ we have that $AB = AC = 14$ and $BC = 26.$ What is the length of the shortest angle bisector in $ABC$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\nAnswer:\n",
