Then the volume of cone $A$ is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi x^2 y,\\] and the volume of cone $B$ is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi y^2 x,\\] so the desired ratio is \\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\pi x^2 y}{\\frac{1}{3} \\pi xy^2} = \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{14.8}{28.3} = \\boxed{\\frac{148}{283}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn.

Furthermore, if the radius of the base of the cone is $r$, then the side length of the square is $2r$.\n\nLet $h$ be the common height of the cone and the prism.  Then the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h,\\] and the volume of the prism is $(2r)^2 h = 4r^2 h$, so the desired ratio is \\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h}{4r^2 h} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{12}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The truncated right circular cone has a large base radius 8 cm and a small base radius of 4 cm.

We don't know the height of the small cone, so call it $x$.  Since the small and large cone are similar, we have $x/4=(x+6)/8$; solving yields $x=6$.  Hence the small cone has radius 4, height 6, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(4^2)(6)=32\\pi$ and the large cone has radius 8, height 12, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(8^2)(12)=256\\pi$.

Consider the 4 cones in the diagram: the smallest one on top (cone A), the top 2 pieces (cone B), the top 3 pieces (cone C), and all 4 pieces together (cone D). Because each piece of the large cone has the same height as the smallest cone and the same angle and vertex at the top, each of the 4 cones is a dilation of the smaller cone at the top. In other words, all four cones are similar. Because cone B has height twice that of cone A, its circular base has twice the radius as that of A. Likewise, cone C has three times the height, and thus 3 times the radius, and cone D has 4 times the height and 4 times the radius. Thus, using the formula for the volume of a cone, we get  \\begin{align*}\nV_B&=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (2r)^2 (2h)=\\frac{8}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\\\\nV_C&=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (3r)^2 (3h)=\\frac{27}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\\\\nV_D&=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (4r)^2 (4h)=\\frac{64}{3} \\pi r^2 h \n\\end{align*}Looking at the diagram, we can see that the largest piece will be the volume of cone D minus that of cone C: \\[V_{1}=\\frac{64}{3} \\pi r^2 h-\\frac{27}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{64-27}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{37}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\]Also notice that the volume of the second largest piece is the volume of cone C minus that of cone B: \\[V_{2}=\\frac{27}{3} \\pi r^2 h-\\frac{8}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{27-8}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{19}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\]Thus, the ratio of the volume of the second largest piece to that of the largest piece is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{V_2}{V_1}=\\frac{\\frac{19}{3} \\pi r^2 h}{\\frac{37}{3} \\pi r^2 h} \n=\\frac{\\frac{19}{\\cancel{3}} \\cancel{\\pi} \\cancel{r^2} \\cancel{h}}{\\frac{37}{\\cancel{3}} \\cancel{\\pi} \\cancel{r^2} \\cancel{h}} \n=\\boxed{\\frac{19}{37}}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cone has a volume of $12288\\pi$ cubic inches and the vertex angle of the vertical cross section is 60 degrees.

The ratio of the base to the height of an equilateral triangle is 1 to $\\sqrt{3}/2$. In terms of the radius, $r$, the base is $2r$ and the height is $2r\\sqrt{3}/2$, or $r\\sqrt{3}$. Since we know the volume of the cone, we can use the volume formula and solve the equation  \\[(1/3) \\times \\pi \\times r^2 \\times r\\sqrt{3} = 12288\\pi\\]  for $r$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $\\pi$ gives  $(1/3)r^3\\sqrt{3} = 12288$. Tripling both sides, we get $r^3\\sqrt{3} = 36,\\!864$. Now, we want $r\\sqrt{3},$ so we multiply both sides by $3$ to get $r^3\\cdot(\\sqrt{3})^3 = (r\\sqrt{3})^3 = 36,\\!864 \\cdot 3 = 110,\\!592.$ Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $r\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{48.0}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the ratio of the volume of the cone to the volume of the cylinder.

The cone has the same radius as the cylinder and half the height, so it has $1/3$ the volume of half the cylinder and thus has $1/2\\cdot 1/3 = 1/6$ the volume of the whole cylinder.
