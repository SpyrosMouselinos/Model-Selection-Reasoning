    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles trapezoid has legs of length 30 cm each, two diagonals of length 40 cm each and the longer base is 50 cm. What is the trapezoid's area in sq cm?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can pick a diagonal and a leg of the trapezoid such that, along with the longer base, these lines form a triangle with sides of length 30, 40, and 50. This is a Pythagorean triple, so the triangle is a right triangle. It follows that the altitude to the longer base of the trapezoid is $30\\cdot 40/50 = 24$. This altitude is the same length as the height of the trapezoid.\n\nWe now look at the right triangle formed by this altitude, the adjacent leg of the trapezoid, and part of the longer base. These three sides form a right triangle, with hypotenuse of 30 and one leg (the altitude) of length 24. It follows that the other leg has length 18.\n\nBecause this is an isosceles trapezoid, we can now calculate the shorter base to have length $50 - 2\\cdot 18 = 14$. Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is $\\dfrac{(50 + 14)(24)}{2} = \\boxed{768}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $ADC$ are isosceles with $AB=BC$ and $AD=DC$. Point $D$ is inside $\\triangle ABC$, $\\angle ABC = 40^\\circ$, and $\\angle ADC = 140^\\circ$.  What is the degree measure of $\\angle\nBAD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, \\[\n\\angle BAC=\\frac{1}{2}\\displaystyle\\left( 180^{\\circ}-\\angle ABC\\displaystyle\\right)=70^{\\circ}.\n\\] [asy]\npair A,B,C,D;\nA=(-5,0); B=(0,21); C=(5,0); D=(0,6);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw(A--D--C--cycle,linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"$140^{\\circ}$\",(0,4),S);\nlabel(\"$40^{\\circ}$\",(0,15),S);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\n[/asy] Similarly, \\[\n\\angle DAC=\\frac{1}{2}\\left( 180^{\\circ}-\\angle\nADC\\right)=20^{\\circ}.\n\\]  Thus \\[\\angle BAD = \\angle BAC - \\angle DAC\n= \\boxed{50^{\\circ}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles, obtuse triangle has one angle with a degree measure that is 50$\\%$ larger than the measure of a right angle. What is the measure, in degrees, of one of the two smallest angles in the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n An angle with measure $50\\%$ larger than the measure of a right angle has measure $\\frac{3}{2}\\cdot 90^{\\circ}=135^{\\circ}$.\n\nThus the other two angles have a combined measure of $45^{\\circ}$. Each one has a measure of\n\n$$\\frac{45^{\\circ}}{2}=\\boxed{22.5^{\\circ}}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, the angle bisectors are $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$, which intersect at the incenter $I$.  If $\\angle ACB = 38^\\circ$, then find the measure of $\\angle AIE$, in degrees.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $AD$ is an angle bisector, $\\angle BAI = \\angle BAC/2$.  Since $BE$ is an angle bisector, $\\angle ABI = \\angle ABC/2$.  As an angle that is external to triangle $ABI$, $\\angle AIE = \\angle BAI + \\angle ABI = \\angle BAC/2 + \\angle ABC/2$.\n\n[asy]\nimport geometry;\n\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, I;\n\nA = (2,12);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (14,0);\nI = incenter(A,B,C);\nD = extension(A,I,B,C);\nE = extension(B,I,C,A);\nF = extension(C,I,A,B);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D);\ndraw(B--E);\ndraw(C--F);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, NE);\nlabel(\"$F$\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"$I$\", I, NNE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle ACB = 38^\\circ$, \\[\\angle AIE = \\frac{\\angle BAC + \\angle ABC}{2} = \\frac{180^\\circ - \\angle ACB}{2} = \\frac{180^\\circ - 38^\\circ}{2} = \\boxed{71^\\circ}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In an isosceles triangle, one of the angles opposite an equal side is $40^{\\circ}$. How many degrees are in the measure of the triangle's largest angle? [asy] draw((0,0)--(6,0)--(3,2)--(0,0)); label(\"$\\backslash$\",(1.5,1)); label(\"{/}\",(4.5,1));\nlabel(\"$40^{\\circ}$\",(.5,0),dir(45));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two angles opposite the equal sides of an isosceles triangle are congruent, so in this case, both are $40^\\circ$. Since the three angles of a triangle add up to $180^\\circ$, the third angle in this triangle is $(180-40-40)^\\circ = \\boxed{100}^\\circ$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a trapezoid $ABCD$ with $AB$ parallel to $CD$, the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$. If the area of triangle $ABE$ is 50 square units, and the area of triangle $ADE$ is 20 square units, what is the area of trapezoid $ABCD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(2.5inch);\npair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (-3,4);\nB = (5,4);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (0,0);\nE = intersectionpoint(A--C, B--D);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW); label(\"$B$\", B, NE); label(\"$C$\", C, SE); label(\"$D$\", D, SW); label(\"$E$\", E, N);\n[/asy] We will write the area of triangle $XYZ$ as $[XYZ].$  Since triangles $ADC$ and $BCD$ share a base and have the same altitude length to that base, they have the same area. Since $[BCD] = [ADC]$, we have $[BCE] + [CDE] = [ADE] + [CDE]$, so  $[BCE] = [ADE] = 20$.\n\nTo find the area of triangle $CDE$, we note that triangles $CDE$ and $ABE$ are similar, and the ratio of their sides is $DE/BE$. Triangles $ADE$ and $ABE$ share an altitude, so $DE/BE = [ADE]/[ABE] = 20/50 = 2/5$. Since the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their sides, $[CDE]/[ABE] = (DE/BE)^2 = 4/25$, and $[CDE] = (4/25)[ABE] = (4/25)(50) = 8$. Thus, the area of trapezoid $ABCD$ is $[ABE] + [ADE] + [BCE] + [CDE] = 50+20+20+8 = \\boxed{98}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with angle $A$ congruent to angle $B$. The measure of angle $C$ is 30 degrees more than the measure of angle $A$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $C$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $x$ be the number of degrees in the measure of angle $A$.  Then angle $B$ measures $x$ degrees as well and angle $C$ measures $x+30$ degrees.  Since the sum of the interior angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we solve $x+x+x+30=180$ to find $x=50$.  Therefore, angle $C$ measures $x+30=50+30=\\boxed{80}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An isosceles trapezoid is circumscribed around a circle. The longer base of the trapezoid is $16$, and one of the base angles is $\\arcsin(.8)$. Find the area of the trapezoid.\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 72\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 75\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 80\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 90\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ \\text{not uniquely determined}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the trapezium have diagonal legs of length $x$ and a shorter base of length $y$. Drop altitudes from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base to form two right-angled triangles, which are congruent since the trapezium is isosceles. Thus using the base angle of $\\arcsin(0.8)$ gives the vertical side of these triangles as $0.8x$ and the horizontal side as $0.6x$. Now notice that the sides of the trapezium can be seen as being made up of tangents to the circle, and thus using the fact that \"the tangents from a point to a circle are equal in length\" gives $2y + 0.6x + 0.6x = 2x$. Also, using the given length of the longer base tells us that $y + 0.6x + 0.6x = 16$. Solving these equations simultaneously gives $x=10$ and $y=4$, so the height of the trapezium is $0.8 \\times 10 = 8$. Thus the area is $\\frac{1}{2}(4+16)(8) = \\boxed{80}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with angle $B$ congruent to angle $C$. The measure of angle $C$ is four times the measure of angle $A$. What is the number of degrees in the measure of angle $B$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $x$ be the number of degrees in $\\angle A$. Then $\\angle C=4x^\\circ$, and $\\angle B$ is also $4x^\\circ$ (since $\\angle B$ is congruent to $\\angle C$).\n\nSince the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, we have $$x + 4x + 4x = 180,$$ which we can solve for $x=20$. Therefore, $\\angle B = 4\\cdot 20 = \\boxed{80}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $\\Delta ABC$ is isosceles with $AC = BC$. If $m\\angle C = 40^{\\circ}$, what is the number of degrees in $m\\angle CBD$? [asy] pair A,B,C,D,E;\nC = dir(65); B = C + dir(-65); D = (1.5,0); E = (2,0);\ndraw(B--C--A--E); dot(D);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S); label(\"$B$\",B,S); label(\"$D$\",D,S); label(\"$C$\",C,N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $x$ be the number of degrees in $\\angle ABC$. Since $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles with $AC=BC$, we have $\\angle BAC=\\angle ABC$.\n\nSo, the three interior angles of $\\triangle ABC$ measure $x^\\circ$, $x^\\circ$, and $40^\\circ$. The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\\circ$, so we have $$x+x+40 = 180,$$which we can solve to obtain $x=70$. Finally, $\\angle CBD$ is supplementary to angle $\\angle ABC$, so \\begin{align*}\nm\\angle CBD &= 180^\\circ - m\\angle ABC \\\\\n&= 180^\\circ - 70^\\circ \\\\\n&= \\boxed{110}^\\circ.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The acute angles of a particular isosceles trapezoid each measure 40 degrees. What is the measure, in degrees, of each obtuse angle in the trapezoid?\n\nAnswer:\n",
