    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n For the quadrilateral shown, how many different whole numbers could be the length of the diagonal represented by the dashed line?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(5,5)--(12,1)--(7,-8)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(12,1),dashed);\nlabel(\"8\",(2.5,2.5),NW);\nlabel(\"10\",(8.5,3),NE);\nlabel(\"16\",(9.5, -3.5),SE);\nlabel(\"12\",(3.5,-4),SW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label the vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ as shown, and let $x = AC$.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(5,5)--(12,1)--(7,-8)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(12,1),dashed);\nlabel(\"8\",(2.5,2.5),NW);\nlabel(\"10\",(8.5,3),NE);\nlabel(\"16\",(9.5, -3.5),SE);\nlabel(\"12\",(3.5,-4),SW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(5,5),N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(12,1),E);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(7,-8),S);\nlabel(\"$x$\", ((0,0) + (12,1))/2, N);\n[/asy]\n\nBy the triangle inequality on triangle $ABC$, \\begin{align*}\nx + 8 &> 10, \\\\\nx + 10 &> 8, \\\\\n8 + 10 &> x,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $x > 2$, $x > -2$, and $x < 18$.\n\nBy the triangle inequality on triangle $CDA$, \\begin{align*}\nx + 12 &> 16, \\\\\nx + 16 &> 12, \\\\\n12 + 16 &> x,\n\\end{align*} which tell us that $x > 4$, $x > -4$, and $x < 28$.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $x$ are $5, 6, \\dots, 17$, for a total of $17 - 5 + 1 = \\boxed{13}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many different isosceles triangles have integer side lengths and perimeter 23?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because the perimeter of such a triangle is 23, and the sum of the two equal side lengths is even, the length of the base is odd. Also, the length of the base is less than the sum of the other two side lengths, so it is less than half of 23. Thus the $\\boxed{6}$ possible triangles have side lengths 1, 11, 11; 3, 10, 10; 5, 9, 9; 7, 8, 8; 9, 7, 7 and 11, 6, 6.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the staircase-shaped region below, all angles that look like right angles are right angles, and each of the eight congruent sides marked with a tick mark have length 1 foot.  If the region has area 53 square feet, what is the number of feet in the perimeter of the region? [asy]\nsize(120);\ndraw((5,7)--(0,7)--(0,0)--(9,0)--(9,3)--(8,3)--(8,4)--(7,4)--(7,5)--(6,5)--(6,6)--(5,6)--cycle);\nlabel(\"9 ft\",(4.5,0),S);\ndraw((7.85,3.5)--(8.15,3.5)); draw((6.85,4.5)--(7.15,4.5)); draw((5.85,5.5)--(6.15,5.5)); draw((4.85,6.5)--(5.15,6.5));\ndraw((8.5,2.85)--(8.5,3.15)); draw((7.5,3.85)--(7.5,4.15)); draw((6.5,4.85)--(6.5,5.15)); draw((5.5,5.85)--(5.5,6.15));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can look at the region as a rectangle with a smaller staircase-shaped region removed from its upper-right corner.  We extend two of its sides to complete the rectangle: [asy]\nsize(120);\ndraw((5,7)--(0,7)--(0,0)--(9,0)--(9,3)--(8,3)--(8,4)--(7,4)--(7,5)--(6,5)--(6,6)--(5,6)--cycle);\ndraw((5,7)--(9,7)--(9,3),dashed);\n[/asy] Dissecting the small staircase, we see it consists of ten 1 ft by 1 ft squares and thus has area 10 square feet. [asy]\nsize(120);\ndraw((5,7)--(0,7)--(0,0)--(9,0)--(9,3)--(8,3)--(8,4)--(7,4)--(7,5)--(6,5)--(6,6)--(5,6)--cycle);\ndraw((5,7)--(9,7)--(9,3),dashed);\ndraw((8,7)--(8,4)--(9,4),dashed); draw((7,7)--(7,5)--(9,5),dashed); draw((6,7)--(6,6)--(9,6),dashed);\n[/asy] Let the height of the rectangle have length $x$ feet, so the area of the rectangle is $9x$ square feet.  Thus we can write the area of the staircase-shaped region as $9x-10$.  Setting this equal to $53$ and solving for $x$ yields $9x-10=53 \\Rightarrow x=7$ feet.\n\nFinally, the perimeter of the region is $7+9+3+5+8\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{32}$ feet.  (Notice how this is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle -- if we shift each horizontal side with length 1 upwards and each vertical side with length 1 rightwards, we get a rectangle.)\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many integer side lengths are possible to complete a triangle in which the other sides measure 6 units and 3 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By the Triangle Inequality, the unknown side must measure less than $6+3=9$ units. Also, the length of that side plus 3 units must be more than 6 units, so the unknown length must be more than 3 units. There are $\\boxed{5}$ possible integer side lengths greater than 3 units and less than 9 units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many non-similar triangles have angles whose degree measures are distinct positive integers in  arithmetic progression?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $n-d$, $n$, and $n+d$ be the angles in the triangle. Then \\[\n180 = n-d+n+n+d= 3n, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad n=60.\n\\] Because the sum of the degree measures of two angles of a triangle is less than 180, we have $$180 > n + (n+d) = 120 + d,$$ which implies that $0<d<60$.\n\nThere are $\\boxed{59}$ triangles   with this property.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the sum of the number of faces, edges and vertices of a triangular prism?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(10,0)--(5,8.7)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(20,20),dashed);\ndraw((10,0)--(30,20));\ndraw((5,8.7)--(25,28.7));\ndraw((25,28.7)--(30,20)--(20,20)--cycle,dashed);\ndraw((25,28.7)--(30,20));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Faces: There are $3$ on the sides, a top face, and a bottom face, so $5$.\n\nEdges: There are $3$ on the top, $3$ on the bottom, and $3$ connecting them, for $9$.\n\nVertices: There are $3$ on the top and $3$ on the bottom, for $6$.\n\nSo $5+9+6=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A convex polyhedron $P$ has $26$ vertices, $60$ edges, and $36$ faces, $24$ of which are triangular and $12$ of which are quadrilaterals. A space diagonal is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices that do not belong to the same face. How many space diagonals does $P$ have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Every pair of vertices of the polyhedron determines either an edge, a face diagonal or a space diagonal. We have ${26 \\choose 2} = \\frac{26\\cdot25}2 = 325$ total line segments determined by the vertices. Of these, $60$ are edges. Each triangular face has $0$ face diagonals and each quadrilateral face has $2$, so there are $2 \\cdot 12 = 24$ face diagonals. This leaves $325 - 60 - 24 = \\boxed{241}$ segments to be the space diagonals.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measures of angles $A$ and $B$ are both positive, integer numbers of degrees. The measure of angle $A$ is a multiple of the measure of angle $B$, and angles $A$ and $B$ are complementary angles. How many measures are possible for angle $A$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The given information tells us that $A = 90^\\circ -B$ and $A=kB$ for some $k\\ge1$.  Therefore, we have $kB = 90^\\circ - B$. This simplifies to $(k+1)B=90^\\circ$. $k+1$ can be any factor of $90$ except one, since $k+1\\ge2$. $90=2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$ has $2\\cdot3\\cdot2=12$ factors, so there are 11 possible values of $k$. Each value of $k$ uniquely determines the value of $B$ and therefore the value of $A$, so there are $\\boxed{11}$ possible measures for $A$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A prism has 15 edges. How many faces does the prism have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If a prism has 2 bases and $L$ lateral faces, then each base is an $L$-gon, so the two bases collectively have $2L$ edges.  Also, there are $L$ edges connecting corresponding vertices of the two bases, for a total of $3L$ edges.  Solving $3L=15$, we find that the prism has 5 lateral faces and hence $5+2=\\boxed{7}$ faces in total.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measures of the interior angles of a convex hexagon form an increasing arithmetic sequence. How many such sequences are possible if the hexagon is not equiangular and all of the angle degree measures are positive integers less than $150$ degrees?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The number of degrees in a hexagon is $(6-2) \\cdot 180=720$ degrees. Setting the degree of the smallest angle to be $x$, and the increment to be $d$, we get that the sum of all of the degrees is $x+x+d+x+2d+x+3d+x+4d+x+5d=6x+15d=720$. We want $15d$ to be even so that adding it to an even number $6x$ would produce an even number $720$. Therefore, $d$ must be even. The largest angle we can have must be less than $150$, so we try even values for $d$ until we get an angle that's greater or equal to $150$.  Similarly, we can conclude that $x$ must be a multiple of 5.\n\nThe largest angle is $x + 5d.$  We notice that, if we divide both sides of $6x + 15d = 720$ by 3, we get $2x + 5d = 240.$  For $x + 5d < 150,$ we must have $x > 90.$  The largest value of $d$ occurs when $x = 95$ and $5d = 240 - 2x = 240 - 2 \\cdot 95 = 240 - 190 = 50,$ or $d = 10.$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ values for $d$: $2,4,6,8,$ and $10$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many of the letters in MATHCOUNTS have a horizontal line of symmetry?\n\nAnswer:\n",
