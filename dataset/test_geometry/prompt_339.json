The cone has the same radius as the cylinder and half the height, so it has $1/3$ the volume of half the cylinder and thus has $1/2\\cdot 1/3 = 1/6$ the volume of the whole cylinder.

Furthermore, if the radius of the base of the cone is $r$, then the side length of the square is $2r$.\n\nLet $h$ be the common height of the cone and the prism.

In the problem, since three edges emanate from each vertex, the boundary of the cylinder touches the cube at three points. Because the space diagonal of the cube is vertical, by the symmetry of the cube, the three points form an equilateral triangle. Because the radius of the circle is $4$, by the Law of Cosines, the side length s of the equilateral triangle is\n\\[s^2 = 2\\cdot(4^2) - 2l\\cdot(4^2)\\cos(120^{\\circ}) = 3(4^2)\\]\nso $s = 4\\sqrt{3}$.* Again by the symmetry of the cube, the volume we want to find is the volume of a tetrahedron with right angles on all faces at the submerged vertex, so since the lengths of the legs of the tetrahedron are $\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{6}$ (the three triangular faces touching the submerged vertex are all $45-45-90$ triangles) so\n\\[v = \\frac{1}{3}(2\\sqrt{6})\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot (2\\sqrt{6})^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 48\\sqrt{6} = 8\\sqrt{6}\\]\nso\n\\[v^2 = 64 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{384}.\\]\nIn this case, our base was one of the isosceles triangles (not the larger equilateral one). To calculate volume using the latter, note that the height would be $2\\sqrt{2}$.\nNote that in a 30-30-120 triangle, side length ratios are $1:1:\\sqrt{3}$.\nOr, note that the altitude and the centroid of an equilateral triangle are the same point, so since the centroid is 4 units from the vertex (which is $\\frac{2}{3}$ the length of the median), the altitude is 6, which gives a hypotenuse of $\\frac{12}{\\sqrt{3}}=4\\sqrt{3}$ by $1:\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}:\\frac{1}{2}$ relationship for 30-60-90 triangles.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The truncated right circular cone has a large base radius 8 cm and a small base radius of 4 cm. The height of the truncated cone is 6 cm. How many $\\text{cm}^3$ are in the volume of this solid?

We don't know the height of the small cone, so call it $x$.  Since the small and large cone are similar, we have $x/4=(x+6)/8$; solving yields $x=6$.  Hence the small cone has radius 4, height 6, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(4^2)(6)=32\\pi$ and the large cone has radius 8, height 12, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(8^2)(12)=256\\pi$.  The frustum's volume is the difference of these two volumes, or $256\\pi-32\\pi=\\boxed{224\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cone has a volume of $12288\\pi$ cubic inches and the vertex angle of the vertical cross section is 60 degrees.

The ratio of the base to the height of an equilateral triangle is 1 to $\\sqrt{3}/2$. In terms of the radius, $r$, the base is $2r$ and the height is $2r\\sqrt{3}/2$, or $r\\sqrt{3}$. Since we know the volume of the cone, we can use the volume formula and solve the equation  \\[(1/3) \\times \\pi \\times r^2 \\times r\\sqrt{3} = 12288\\pi\\]  for $r$. Dividing both sides of the equation by $\\pi$ gives  $(1/3)r^3\\sqrt{3} = 12288$. Tripling both sides, we get $r^3\\sqrt{3} = 36,\\!864$. Now, we want $r\\sqrt{3},$ so we multiply both sides by $3$ to get $r^3\\cdot(\\sqrt{3})^3 = (r\\sqrt{3})^3 = 36,\\!864 \\cdot 3 = 110,\\!592.$ Taking the cube root of both sides, we get $r\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{48.0}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cone is formed from a 300-degree sector of a circle of radius 18 by aligning the two straight sides.
