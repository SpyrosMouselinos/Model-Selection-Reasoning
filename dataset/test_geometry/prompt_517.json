    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The radius of a cylinder is doubled and its height is tripled. If its original volume was 10 cubic feet, what is its volume now, in cubic feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cylinder's original radius and height be $r$ and $h$, respectively.  The new cylinder has volume \\[\n\\pi (2r)^2(3h)=12\\pi r^2 h,\n\\] which is 12 times larger than the original volume.  Since the original volume was 10 cubic feet, the new volume is $\\boxed{120}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cylinder with its diameter equal to its height is inscribed in a right circular cone. The cone has diameter 10 and altitude 12, and the axes of the cylinder and cone coincide. Find the radius of the cylinder. Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cylinder have radius $r$ and height $2r$. Since $\\triangle APQ$ is similar to $\\triangle AOB$, we have $$\\frac{12-2r}{r} = \\frac{12}{5}, \\text{ so } r = \\boxed{\\frac{30}{11}}.$$[asy]\ndraw((0,2)..(-6,0)--(6,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,-2)..(-6,0)--(6,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,1)..(-3,0)--(3,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,-1)..(-3,0)--(3,0)..cycle);\nfill((-6,0.01)--(-6,-0.01)--(6,-0.01)--(6,0.01)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,14)--(0,0)--(6,0),dashed);\ndraw((0,8)..(-3,7)--(3,7)..cycle);\ndraw((0,6)..(-3,7)--(3,7)..cycle);\nfill((-3,7.01)--(-3,6.99)--(3,6.99)--(3,7.01)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,7)--(3,7),dashed);\ndraw((-6,0)--(0,14)--(6,0));\ndraw((-3,0)--(-3,7));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,7));\nlabel(\"{\\tiny O}\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny B}\",(6,0),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny P}\",(0,7),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny Q}\",(3,7),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny A}\",(0,14),E);\ndraw((0,-2.5)--(6,-2.5),Arrows);\ndraw((-6.5,0)--(-6.5,14),Arrows);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 5}\",(3,-2.5),S);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12}\",(-6.5,7),W);\ndraw((10,0)--(15,0)--(10,12)--cycle);\ndraw((10,6)--(12.5,6));\ndraw((15.5,0)--(15.5,12),Arrows);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny O}\",(10,0),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny P}\",(10,6),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny A}\",(10,12),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 2r}\",(10,3),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12-2r}\",(10,9),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny B}\",(15,0),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny Q}\",(12.5,6),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12}\",(15.5,6),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 5}\",(12.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cylinder has a height of $10$ and a radius of $3.$ Determine the total surface area, including the two ends, of the cylinder. [asy]\ndraw(ellipse((5,0),5,2),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw(ellipse((5,10),5,2),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((1,8.95)--(5,10),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,10),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((10,0)--(10,10),black+linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"3\",(1,8.95)--(5,10),NW);\nlabel(\"10\",(0,0)--(0,10),W);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To calculate the total surface area of the cylinder, we cut off the two ends to obtain two circles of radius $3.$\n\n[asy]\ndraw(circle((3,3),3),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((3,3)--(5.1213,3-2.1213),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw(circle((11,3),3),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((11,3)--(13.1213,3-2.1213),black+linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"3\",(3,3)--(5.1213,3-2.1213),SW);\nlabel(\"3\",(11,3)--(13.1213,3-2.1213),SW);\n[/asy]\n\nThe two ends combined have an area of $$2\\pi r^2 = 2 \\pi(3^2)=18\\pi.$$ Next, we must calculate the lateral surface area. To do this, we make a vertical cut through this area, and unroll the lateral surface. When we do this, we obtain a rectangle with height $10.$ The width of the rectangle (ie. the length of the top edge) is equal to the circumference of one of the ends, since the top edge of this rectangle lay exactly along the circumference of the top end.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(15,0)--(15,10)--(0,10)--cycle,black+linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"10\",(0,0)--(0,10),W);\n[/asy]\n\nThe circumference of one of the ends is $$2\\pi r = 2\\pi(3)=6\\pi,$$ so the width of the rectangle is $6\\pi.$ Therefore, the area of this rectangle is $10\\times 6\\pi = 60\\pi.$ So the total surface area of the cylinder is $18\\pi + 60\\pi = \\boxed{78\\pi}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Either increasing the radius or the height of a cylinder by six inches will result in the same volume. The original height of the cylinder is two inches. What is the original radius in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the original radius be $r$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased radius is $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased height is $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Since we are told these two volumes are the same, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2 = \\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Simplifying, we have $(r+6)^2=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2+12r+36=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2-4r-12=0$. Factoring, we have $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=\\boxed{6}$ (it cannot be negative because it is a physical length).\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cylinders each have radius 8 inches and height 3 inches. The radius of one cylinder and the height of the other are both increased by the same nonzero number of inches. The resulting volumes are equal. How many inches is the increase? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the increase measure $x$ inches.  The cylinder with increased radius now has volume  \\[\\pi (8+x)^2 (3)\\] and the cylinder with increased height now has volume \\[\\pi (8^2) (3+x).\\] Setting these two quantities equal and solving yields  \\[3(64+16x+x^2)=64(3+x) \\Rightarrow 3x^2-16x=x(3x-16)=0\\] so $x=0$ or $x=16/3$.  The latter is the valid solution, so the increase measures $\\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Cylinder $B$'s height is equal to the radius of cylinder $A$ and cylinder $B$'s radius is equal to the height $h$ of cylinder $A$. If the volume of cylinder $A$ is twice the volume of cylinder $B$, the volume of cylinder $A$ can be written as $N \\pi h^3$ cubic units. What is the value of $N$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(4cm,4cm);\npath a=(0,-1.2)..(-10,0)--(10,0)..cycle;\npath b=(17,-0.9)..(13,0)--(21,0)..cycle;\npath c=(0,1.2)..(-10,0)--(10,0)..cycle;\npath d=(17,0.9)..(13,0)--(21,0)..cycle;\ndraw(c);\ndraw(d);\ndraw(shift((0,7))*a);\ndraw(shift((0,7))*c);\ndraw(shift((0,15))*b);\ndraw(shift((0,15))*d);\ndraw((-10,0)--(-10,7));\ndraw((10,0)--(10,7));\ndraw((13,0)--(13,15));\ndraw((21,0)--(21,15));\ndraw(a);\ndraw(b);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,9),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(17,18),N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First, let us denote the radius of cylinder A (and height of cylinder B) as $r$, and the height of cylinder A (and radius of cylinder B) as $h$.  Therefore, if the volume of cylinder A is double that of B, then: $\\frac{\\text{Volume of Cylinder A}}{\\text{Volume of Cylinder B}} = \\frac{r^2 \\cdot h}{h^2 \\cdot r} = \\frac{r}{h} = 2$.  Therefore, normally the volume of Cylinder A is expressed as $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot h$, and plugging in $r = 2h$, we see that the volume of Cylinder A $= 4\\pi \\cdot h^3$, hence $N = \\boxed{4}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Increasing the radius of a cylinder by $6$ units increased the volume by $y$ cubic units. Increasing the height of the cylinder by $6$ units also increases the volume by $y$ cubic units. If the original height is $2$, then the original radius is:\n$\\text{(A) } 2 \\qquad \\text{(B) } 4 \\qquad \\text{(C) } 6 \\qquad \\text{(D) } 6\\pi \\qquad \\text{(E) } 8$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that the volume of a cylinder is equal to $\\pi r^2h$, where $r$ and $h$ are the radius and height, respectively. So we know that $2\\pi (r+6)^2-2\\pi r^2=y=\\pi r^2(2+6)-2\\pi r^2$. Expanding and rearranging, we get that $2\\pi (12r+36)=6\\pi r^2$. Divide both sides by $6\\pi$ to get that $4r+12=r^2$, and rearrange to see that $r^2-4r-12=0$. This factors to become $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=6$ or $r=-2$. Obviously, the radius cannot be negative, so our answer is $\\boxed{6}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone having a diameter of 10cm and a height of 6cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The radius of the base of the cone is $10/2 = 5$, so the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{50 \\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cylindrical oil tank is $15$ feet tall and its circular bases have diameters of $4$ feet each. When the tank is lying flat on its side (not on one of the circular ends), the oil inside is $3$ feet deep. How deep, in feet, would the oil have been if the tank had been standing upright on one of its bases? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the oil is $3$ feet deep, we want to find the ratio of the area of the part of the circle covered with oil (part under the horizontal line of the figure below) to the entire area of the circle.\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),2));\ndraw((-1.732,1)--(1.732,1));\ndraw((0,0)--(-1.732,1));\ndraw((0,0)--(1.732,1));\ndraw((0,0)--(0,1));\n[/asy] The two radii drawn makes a $120$ degree angle, so the area of the fraction of the circle covered by the oil is $\\frac23$ of the circle in addition to the isosceles triangle. We can find the length of half the base of the isosceles triangle by using the Pythagorean theorem on the smaller right triangle. Setting half the length of the base to $x$, we have $x^2+1=4$, so $x=\\sqrt{3}$ and the length of the base is $2\\sqrt3$. Therefore, we have that the area of the triangle is $\\frac12 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2\\sqrt3=\\sqrt3$. So, the area of the part of the circle that's covered in oil is $\\frac23 \\cdot 4\\pi + \\sqrt3=\\frac83\\pi+\\sqrt3$.\n\nThus, we have that the oil takes up $\\dfrac{\\frac83\\pi+\\sqrt3}{4\\pi} \\approx \\frac{10.11}{12.57} \\approx 0.805$ of the cylinder.\n\nWith the cylinder upright, the fraction of the cylinder the oil covers is the same as the fraction of the height the oil covers. Therefore, the oil would be $15 \\text{ feet} \\cdot 0.805 \\approx 12.08 \\approx \\boxed{12.1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cones with radius 12 cm and height 12 cm are enclosed within a cylinder. The base of each cone is a base of the cylinder, and the height of the cylinder is 24 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cylinder not occupied by the cones? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylinder has volume $\\pi (12)^2 (24)$ cubic cm.  Each cone has volume $(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12)$ cubic cm.  Hence the volume of the space in the cylinder not occupied by the cones is  \\begin{align*}\n\\pi (12)^2 (24) - (2)(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12) &= 12^3\\pi(2-2/3)\\\\\n&=12^3\\pi(4/3)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{2304\\pi} \\text{ cubic cm}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cylinder has a height of 10 and a radius of 3.  Determine the volume of the cylinder.\n\nAnswer:\n",
