    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Segment $s_1$ has endpoints at $(4,1)$ and $(-8,5)$.  Segment $s_2$ is obtained by translating $s_1$ by $2$ units to the right and $3$ units up. Find the midpoint of segment $s_2$.  Express your answer as $(a,b)$ with $a$ and $b$ integers.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The midpoint of segment $s_1$ can be found using the midpoint formula: $\\left(\\frac{4-8}2,\\frac{1+5}2\\right)=(-2,3).$  The midpoint of $s_2$ is the translation of the midpoint of $s_1$ be $2$ units to the right and $3$ units up.  Thus its coordinates are $(-2+2,3+3)=\\boxed{(0,6)}.$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right triangle $ABC$, $AB=10$, $AC=6$ and $BC=8$ units.  What is the distance from $C$ to the midpoint of segment $AB$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the length of the hypotenuse.  Therefore, the desired distance is $10/2 = \\boxed{5}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Medians are drawn from point $A$ and point $B$ in this right triangle to divide segments $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AC}$ in half, respectively. The lengths of the medians are 6 and $2\\sqrt{11}$ units, respectively. How many units are in the length of segment $\\overline{AB}$?\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(7,0)--(0,4)--(0,0)--cycle,linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,1/2)--(1/2,1/2)--(1/2,0),linewidth(1));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,4),NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(7,0),E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(0,0),SW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We draw the medians as shown below.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(7,0)--(0,4)--(0,0)--cycle,linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,1/2)--(1/2,1/2)--(1/2,0),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,4)--(3.5,0));\ndraw((0,2)--(7,0));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,4),NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(7,0),E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$M$\",(3.5,0),S);\nlabel(\"$N$\",(0,2),W);\n[/asy]\n\nFrom right triangles $ACM$ and $BCN$, we have \\begin{align*}\nAC^2 + CM^2 &= 36,\\\\\nBC^2 + CN^2 &= (2\\sqrt{11})^2 = 44.\\end{align*}\n\nHowever, we have $CM = BC/2$ and $CN = AC/2$, so the equations above become \\begin{align*}\nAC^2 + \\frac14BC^2 &= 36,\\\\\nBC^2 + \\frac14AC^2 &=44.\n\\end{align*}\n\nAdding these equations gives  \\[\\frac54(AC^2 + BC^2) = 80,\\] so $AC^2 + BC^2 = 64$.  But the Pythagorean Theorem gives us $AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$, so $AB^2 = 64$, which means $AB = \\boxed{8}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The points $B(1, 1)$, $I(2, 4)$ and $G(5, 1)$ are plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system to form triangle $BIG$. Triangle $BIG$ is translated five units to the left and two units upward to triangle $B'I'G'$, in such a way that $B'$ is the image of $B$, $I'$ is the image of $I$, and $G'$ is the image of $G$. What is the midpoint of segment $B'G'$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since triangle $B^\\prime I^\\prime G^\\prime$ is translated from triangle $BIG,$ the midpoint of $B^\\prime G ^\\prime $ is the midpoint of $BG$ translated five units left and two units up. The midpoint of $BG$ is at $\\left( \\frac{1+5}{2}, \\frac{1+1}{2} \\right) = (3, 1).$ Thus, the midpoint of $B ^\\prime G ^\\prime$ is at $(3-5,1+2)=\\boxed{(-2,3)}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $P$ and $R$ are located at (2, 1) and (12, 15) respectively. Point $M$ is the midpoint of segment $\\overline{PR}$. Segment $\\overline{PR}$ is reflected over the $x$-axis. What is the sum of the coordinates of the image of point $M$ (the midpoint of the reflected segment)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Point $M$ has coordinates $(7,8)$. Therefore, its image has coordinates $(7,-8)$. Thus the sum is $7-8 = \\boxed{-1}$.\n\nAlternatively, the image of point $M$ is the midpoint of the images of points $P$ and $R$ and thus is the midpoint of $(2,-1)$ and $(12,-15)$, which is also $(7,-8)$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $R = (8,6)$. The lines whose equations are $8y = 15x$ and $10y = 3x$ contain points $P$ and $Q$, respectively, such that $R$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{PQ}$. The length of $PQ$ equals $\\frac {m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy] pointpen = black; pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair R = (8,6), P = (32,60)/7, Q= (80,24)/7; D((0,0)--MP(\"x\",(13,0),E),EndArrow(6)); D((0,0)--MP(\"y\",(0,10),N),EndArrow(6)); D((0,0)--(10/(15/8),10),EndArrow(6)); D((0,0)--(13,13 * 3/10),EndArrow(6)); D(D(MP(\"P\",P,NW))--D(MP(\"Q\",Q),SE),linetype(\"4 4\")); D(MP(\"R\",R,NE)); [/asy]\nThe coordinates of $P$ can be written as $\\left(a, \\frac{15a}8\\right)$ and the coordinates of point $Q$ can be written as $\\left(b,\\frac{3b}{10}\\right)$. By the midpoint formula, we have $\\frac{a+b}2=8$ and $\\frac{15a}{16}+\\frac{3b}{20}=6$. Solving for $b$ gives $b= \\frac{80}{7}$, so the point $Q$ is $\\left(\\frac{80}7, \\frac{24}7\\right)$. The answer is twice the distance from $Q$ to $(8,6)$, which by the distance formula is $\\frac{60}{7}$. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{67}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is an isosceles triangle with $AB=BC$. Point $D$ is the midpoint of both $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AE}$, and $\\overline{CE}$ is 11 units long. What is the length of $\\overline{BD}$?  Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n\n[asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(3,112^.5)--(6,0)--cycle);\ndraw((6,0)--(9,112^.5)--(0,0));\nlabel(\"$A$\", (0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", (3,112^.5), N);\nlabel(\"$C$\", (6,0), SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", (4.75,6), N);\nlabel(\"$E$\", (9,112^.5), N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because triangles $D$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$ and $\\overline{AE}$, $ABEC$ must be a parallelogram, so $AB=CE=11$. Then because triangle $ABC$ is isosceles, $BC=AB=11$. That means $BD=\n\\frac{11}{2}$ or $\\boxed{5.5}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In $\\triangle ABC$, we have $AC=BC=7$  and $AB=2$. Suppose that  $D$ is a point on line $AB$ such that $B$ lies between $A$ and $D$ and $CD=8$. What is  $BD$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $\\overline{CH}$  be an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to $\\triangle CHB$ and to $\\triangle CHD$ produces \\[\n8^2 - (BD +1)^2 = CH^2 = 7^2 - 1^2 = 48, \\quad \\text{so} \\quad (BD+1)^2 = 16.\n\\] Thus $BD = \\boxed{3}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5cm);\npair A,B,C,D,H;\nA=(0,0);\nH=(1,0);\nB=(2,0);\nD=(5,0);\nC=(1,6);\ndraw(A--C--D--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(H--C--B--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"1\",(0.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"1\",(1.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"7\",(0.5,3),NW);\nlabel(\"7\",(1.5,3),NE);\nlabel(\"8\",(3.5,3),NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\nlabel(\"$H$\",H,S);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In right $\\Delta ABC$, $\\angle CAB$ is a right angle. Point $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$. What is the number of centimeters in the length of median $\\overline{AM}$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy] pair A,B,C,M;\nA = (0,0); B = (4,0); C = (0,3); M = (B+C)/2;\ndraw(M--A--B--C--A);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$B$\",B,E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,W); label(\"$M$\",M,NE);\nlabel(\"3 cm\",A--C,W); label(\"4 cm\",A--B,S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the hypotenuse.  The hypotenuse of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\sqrt{3^2+4^2} = 5$, so $AM = BC/2 = \\boxed{2.5}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the figure shown, segment $AB$ is parallel to segment $YZ$. If $AZ = 42$ units, $BQ = 12$ units, and $QY = 24$ units, what is the length of segment $QZ$? [asy]\nimport olympiad; import geometry; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\npair Y = (0,0), Z = (16,0), A = (0,8), B = (6,8);\ndraw(A--B--Y--Z--cycle);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$B$\",B,E); label(\"$Y$\",Y,W); label(\"$Z$\",Z,E);\npair Q = intersectionpoint(A--Z,B--Y);\nlabel(\"$Q$\",Q,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $AB \\parallel YZ,$ we know that $\\angle A = \\angle Z$ and $\\angle B = \\angle Y.$ That works out nicely, since that means $\\triangle ABQ \\sim ZYQ.$ If $BQ = 12$ and $QY = 24,$ that means the ratio of sides in $ABQ$ to $ZYQ$ is $1:2.$\n\nSince $AZ = 42 = AQ + QZ$ and $AQ = \\dfrac{QZ}{2},$ that means $\\dfrac{3 \\cdot QZ}{2} = 42$ and thus $QZ = \\boxed{28}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Segment $s_1$ has endpoints at $(1,2)$ and $(7,10)$.  Segment $s_2$ is obtained by translating $s_1$ by $3$ units to the right and $2$ units down. Find the midpoint of segment $s_2$.
