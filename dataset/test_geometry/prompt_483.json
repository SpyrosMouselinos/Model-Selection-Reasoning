    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measure of each exterior angle of a regular polygon is $30$ degrees. What is the sum of the measures of the interior angles, in degrees?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Taking one exterior angle per vertex, the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$. If each exterior angle is $30^\\circ$, then the polygon has $\\frac{360}{30}=12$ sides. The sum of the interior angles of an $n$-sided polygon is $180(n-2)$, so for a polygon with 12 sides, the sum of the interior angles is $180(12-2)=\\boxed{1800}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular polygon has exterior angles each measuring 15 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The measure of each exterior angle in a regular $n$-gon is $360/n$ degrees.  Setting this expression equal to 15, we find $n=\\boxed{24}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular polygon has an exterior angle that measures $15$ degrees. How many sides does the polygon have?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is $360^\\circ$ as long as we take only one exterior angle per vertex. The polygon is regular, so all of the exterior angles have the same degree measure of $15$ degrees. If the polygon has $n$ sides, then the sum of the exterior angles is $15n=360$. So $n=24$ and the polygon has $\\boxed{24}$ sides.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $n$ equal the number of sides in a regular polygon. For $3\\leq n < 10$, how many values of $n$ result in a regular polygon where the common degree measure of the interior angles is not an integer?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The number of degrees is the sum of the interior angles of an $n$-gon is $180(n-2)$.  If the $n$-gon is regular, then each angle measures $\\frac{180(n-2)}{n}$ degrees.  If $n=3$, 4, 5, 6, or 9, then $n$ divides evenly into 180, so the number of degrees in each angle is an integer.  If $n=7$, then the number of degrees is $180\\cdot5/7=900/7$, which is not an integer.  If $n=8$, the number of degrees in each angle is $180\\cdot 6/8=135$.  Therefore, only $\\boxed{1}$ value of $n$ between 3 and 9 results in a non-integer degree measure for each interior angle of a regular $n$-gon.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Polygon $ABCDEF$ is a regular hexagon. What is the measure in degrees of angle $ABF$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In triangle $ABF$, the two acute angles are equal since $AB=AF$. Also, the measure of $\\angle A$ is $180^\\circ(6-2)/6=120^\\circ$.  Letting $x$ be the measure of $\\angle ABF$, we have \\[\n120^\\circ+x+x=180^\\circ \\implies x=\\boxed{30}\\text{ degrees}.\n\\] [asy]\nsize(5cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7));\nint i;\npair A=dir(0), B=dir(60), C=dir(120), D=dir(180), Ep=dir(240), F=dir(300);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D,Ep,F};\nstring[] alphabet={\"$A$\",\"$B$\",\"$C$\",\"$D$\",\"$E$\",\"$F$\"};\ndot(dots);\nfor(i=0;i<6;++i)\n{\n\ndraw(dir(60*i)--dir(60*i+60));\n\nlabel(alphabet[i],dots[i],dots[i]);\n}\ndraw(A--B--F);\ndraw(anglemark(F,B,A));\ndraw(anglemark(A,F,B));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The degree measures of the angles in a convex 18-sided polygon form an increasing arithmetic sequence with integer values. Find the degree measure of the smallest angle.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The average angle in an 18-gon is $160^\\circ$. In an arithmetic sequence the average is the same as the median, so the middle two terms of the sequence average to $160^\\circ$. Thus for some positive (the sequence is increasing and thus non-constant) integer $d$, the middle two terms are $(160-d)^\\circ$ and $(160+d)^\\circ$. Since the step is $2d$ the last term of the sequence is $(160 + 17d)^\\circ$, which must be less than $180^\\circ$, since the polygon is convex. This gives $17d < 20$, so the only suitable positive integer $d$ is 1. The first term is then $(160-17)^\\circ = \\boxed{143}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In the polygon shown, each side is perpendicular to its adjacent sides, and all 28 of the sides are congruent.  The perimeter of the polygon is 56.  Find the area of the polygon.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\ndraw((3,0)--(4,0)--(4,1)--(5,1)--(5,2)--(6,2)--(6,3)--(7,3)--(7,4)--(6,4)--(6,5)--(5,5)--(5,6)--(4,6)--(4,7)--(3,7)--(3,6)--(2,6)--(2,5)--(1,5)--(1,4)--(0,4)--(0,3)--(1,3)--(1,2)--(2,2)--(2,1)--(3,1)--cycle);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can divide the polygon into 25 squares.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.5 cm);\n\ndraw((3,0)--(4,0));\ndraw((2,1)--(5,1));\ndraw((1,2)--(6,2));\ndraw((0,3)--(7,3));\ndraw((0,4)--(7,4));\ndraw((1,5)--(6,5));\ndraw((2,6)--(5,6));\ndraw((3,7)--(4,7));\ndraw((0,3)--(0,4));\ndraw((1,2)--(1,5));\ndraw((2,1)--(2,6));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,7));\ndraw((4,0)--(4,7));\ndraw((5,1)--(5,6));\ndraw((6,2)--(6,5));\ndraw((7,3)--(7,4));\n[/asy]\n\nLet the side length of each square be $s$.  Then the perimeter of the polygon is $28s = 56$, so $s = 2$.  Hence, the area of the polygon is $25s^2 = \\boxed{100}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The figure shows a square in the interior of a regular hexagon.  The square and regular hexagon share a common side. What is the degree measure of $\\angle ABC$? [asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H;\nA=(0,.866);\nB=(.5,1.732);\nC=(1.5,1.732);\nD=(2,.866);\nE=(1.5,0);\nF=(.5,0);\nG=(.5,1);\nH=(1.5,1);\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--E);\ndraw(E--F);\ndraw(F--A);\ndraw(F--G);\ndraw(G--H);\ndraw(H--E);\ndraw(D--H);\nlabel(\"A\", C, N);\nlabel(\"B\", D, E);\nlabel(\"C\", H, N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label the lower right corner of the square point $D$ and the lower left corner $E$. The interior angles of a regular hexagon are 120 degrees and the interior angles of a square are 90 degrees. Thus, $m\\angle BDC=m \\angle BDE - m\\angle CDE=120^\\circ - 90^\\circ = 30^\\circ$. In addition, because the square and regular hexagon share a side and all of their sides have the same length, segments $CD$ and $BD$ have the same length. Thus, triangle $BCD$ is isosceles.\n\nBecause the base angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent, $m\\angle BCD = m \\angle CBD=x$. In addition, because the interior angles of a triangle sum to 180 degrees, we have  \\begin{align*}\n180^\\circ &= m\\angle BDC+m\\angle BCD + m\\angle CBD \\\\\n&=30^\\circ + x + x \\\\\n150^\\circ &= 2x \\\\\n75^\\circ = x\n\\end{align*} Thus, $m\\angle CBD=75^\\circ$. Finally, we calculate $m\\angle ABC=m\\angle ABD- m\\angle CBD=120^\\circ-75^\\circ=\\boxed{45}^\\circ$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measures of angles $A$ and $B$ are both positive, integer numbers of degrees. The measure of angle $A$ is a multiple of the measure of angle $B$, and angles $A$ and $B$ are complementary angles. How many measures are possible for angle $A$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The given information tells us that $A = 90^\\circ -B$ and $A=kB$ for some $k\\ge1$.  Therefore, we have $kB = 90^\\circ - B$. This simplifies to $(k+1)B=90^\\circ$. $k+1$ can be any factor of $90$ except one, since $k+1\\ge2$. $90=2\\cdot3^2\\cdot5$ has $2\\cdot3\\cdot2=12$ factors, so there are 11 possible values of $k$. Each value of $k$ uniquely determines the value of $B$ and therefore the value of $A$, so there are $\\boxed{11}$ possible measures for $A$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The measures of the interior angles of a convex hexagon form an increasing arithmetic sequence. How many such sequences are possible if the hexagon is not equiangular and all of the angle degree measures are positive integers less than $150$ degrees?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The number of degrees in a hexagon is $(6-2) \\cdot 180=720$ degrees. Setting the degree of the smallest angle to be $x$, and the increment to be $d$, we get that the sum of all of the degrees is $x+x+d+x+2d+x+3d+x+4d+x+5d=6x+15d=720$. We want $15d$ to be even so that adding it to an even number $6x$ would produce an even number $720$. Therefore, $d$ must be even. The largest angle we can have must be less than $150$, so we try even values for $d$ until we get an angle that's greater or equal to $150$.  Similarly, we can conclude that $x$ must be a multiple of 5.\n\nThe largest angle is $x + 5d.$  We notice that, if we divide both sides of $6x + 15d = 720$ by 3, we get $2x + 5d = 240.$  For $x + 5d < 150,$ we must have $x > 90.$  The largest value of $d$ occurs when $x = 95$ and $5d = 240 - 2x = 240 - 2 \\cdot 95 = 240 - 190 = 50,$ or $d = 10.$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{5}$ values for $d$: $2,4,6,8,$ and $10$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a regular polygon, the measure of an interior angle is 6.5 times the measure of an exterior angle. How many sides does the polygon have?\n\nAnswer:\n",
