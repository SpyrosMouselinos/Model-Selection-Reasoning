    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Parallelogram $ABCD$ with $A(2,5)$, $B(4,9)$, $C(6,5)$, and $D(4,1)$ is reflected across the $x$-axis to $A'B'C'D'$ and then $A'B'C'D'$ is reflected across the line $y=x+1$ to $A''B''C''D''$. This is done such that $D'$ is the image of $D$, and $D''$ is the image of $D'$. What is the ordered pair of $D''$ in the coordinate plane?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Reflecting a point across the $x$-axis multiplies its $y$-coordinate by $-1$.  Therefore, $D'=(4,-1)$.  To reflect $D'$ across the line $y=x+1$, we first translate both the line and the point down one unit so that the equation of the translated line is $y=x$ and the coordinates of the translated point are $(4,-2)$.  To reflect across $y=x$, we switch the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate to obtain $(-2,4)$.  Translating this point one unit up, we find that $D''=\\boxed{(-2,5)}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $(1,-5)$ and $(11,7)$ are the opposite vertices of a parallelogram.  What are the coordinates of the point where the diagonals of the parallelogram intersect?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The diagonals of a parallelogram intersect at the midpoint of each diagonal. So, we simply find the midpoint of $(1,-5)$ and $(11,7)$, which is $\\left(\\frac{1+11}{2}, \\frac{-5+7}{2}\\right)=\\boxed{(6,1)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ with vertices of $A(6,2)$, $B(2,5)$, and $C(2,2)$ is reflected over the x-axis to triangle $A'B'C'$. This triangle is reflected over the y-axis to triangle $A''B''C''$. What are the coordinates of point $C''$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A reflection over the $x$-axis negates the $y$-coordinate, while a reflection over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coordinate. So reflecting $C$ over the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis means we negate both coordinates to get $\\boxed{(-2, -2)}$ as the coordinates of point $C''$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $A(-4,1), B(-1,4)$ and $C(-1,1)$ are the vertices of $\\triangle ABC$. What will be the coordinates of the image of point A if $\\triangle ABC$ is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n When we rotate images $90^{\\circ}$ the coordinates switch places, and the signs are adjusted based on whether or not an axis was crossed. In this case, rotating point $A$ $90^{\\circ}$ will bring it across the $y$-axis into Quadrant I, which means both the $x$ and $y$ will be positive. The original point $A$ was at $(-4, 1)$ so the final image will be at $(1, 4)$. We also could solve this problem by seeing that the slope of the segment from the origin to $A$ is $-1/4$. If $A$ is moving to a location that is a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation about the origin, it will move to a point on the segment perpendicular to the one that currently connects it to the origin. This will be the segment that has a slope of 4/1 or $-4/-1$ from the origin which puts us at $(1, 4)$ or $(-1, -4)$. The point $\\boxed{(1, 4)}$ is in the clockwise direction we need.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Parallelogram $ABCD$ has vertices $A(3,3)$, $B(-3,-3)$, $C(-9,-3)$, and $D(-3,3)$. If a point is selected at random from the region determined by the parallelogram, what is the probability that the point is not above the $x$-axis? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let us first call the point where the $x$-axis intersects side $\\overline{AB}$ point $E$ and where it intersects $\\overline{CD}$ point $F$. [asy]\ndraw((-12,0)--(6,0),Arrows);\ndraw((0,-6)--(0,6),Arrows);\n\nfor(int i = -11; i < 6; ++i)\n{\n\ndraw((i,.5)--(i,-.5));\n}\n\nfor(int i = -5; i < 6; ++i)\n{\n\ndraw((.5,i)--(-.5,i));\n}\n\ndot((3,3));\ndot((-3,-3));\ndot((-9,-3));\ndot((-3,3));\ndot((0,0));\ndot((-6,0));\n\ndraw((3,3)--(-3,-3)--(-9,-3)--(-3,3)--cycle, linewidth(.65));\ndraw((0,0)--(-6,0), linewidth(.65));\n\nlabel(\"A\",(3,3),NE);\nlabel(\"B\",(-3,-3),SE);\nlabel(\"C\",(-9,-3),SW);\nlabel(\"D\",(-3,3),NW);\nlabel(\"F\",(-6,0),NW);\nlabel(\"E\",(0,0),NW);\n[/asy] Now, since the $x$-axis is parallel to bases $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ of the parallelogram, $\\overline{EF}$ is parallel to the two bases and splits parallelogram $ABCD$ into two smaller parallelograms $AEFD$ and $EBCF$. Since the height of each of these parallelograms is $3$ and the length of their bases equals $AD=BC=6$, both parallelograms must have the same area. Half of parallelogram $ABCD$'s area is above the $x$-axis and half is below, so there is a $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$ probability that the point selected is not above the $x$-axis.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The points $B(1, 1)$, $I(2, 4)$ and $G(5, 1)$ are plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system to form triangle $BIG$. Triangle $BIG$ is translated five units to the left and two units upward to triangle $B'I'G'$, in such a way that $B'$ is the image of $B$, $I'$ is the image of $I$, and $G'$ is the image of $G$. What is the midpoint of segment $B'G'$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since triangle $B^\\prime I^\\prime G^\\prime$ is translated from triangle $BIG,$ the midpoint of $B^\\prime G ^\\prime $ is the midpoint of $BG$ translated five units left and two units up. The midpoint of $BG$ is at $\\left( \\frac{1+5}{2}, \\frac{1+1}{2} \\right) = (3, 1).$ Thus, the midpoint of $B ^\\prime G ^\\prime$ is at $(3-5,1+2)=\\boxed{(-2,3)}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $F$ is taken on the extension of side $AD$ of parallelogram $ABCD$. $BF$ intersects diagonal $AC$ at $E$ and side $DC$ at $G$. If $EF = 32$ and $GF = 24$, then $BE$ equals:\n[asy] size(7cm); pair A = (0, 0), B = (7, 0), C = (10, 5), D = (3, 5), F = (5.7, 9.5); pair G = intersectionpoints(B--F, D--C)[0]; pair E = intersectionpoints(A--C, B--F)[0]; draw(A--D--C--B--cycle); draw(A--C); draw(D--F--B); label(\"$A$\", A, SW); label(\"$B$\", B, SE); label(\"$C$\", C, NE); label(\"$D$\", D, NW); label(\"$F$\", F, N); label(\"$G$\", G, NE); label(\"$E$\", E, SE); //Credit to MSTang for the asymptote[/asy]\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 4 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 8\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 10 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 12 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 16$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $BE = x$ and $BC = y$. Since $AF \\parallel BC$, by AA Similarity, $\\triangle AFE \\sim \\triangle CBE$. That means $\\frac{AF}{CB} = \\frac{FE}{BE}$. Substituting in values results in\\[\\frac{AF}{y} = \\frac{32}{x}\\]Thus, $AF = \\frac{32y}{x}$, so $FD = \\frac{32y - xy}{x}$.\nIn addition, $DC \\parallel AB$, so by AA Similarity, $\\triangle FDG = \\triangle FAB$. That means\\[\\frac{\\frac{32y-xy}{x}}{\\frac{32y}{x}} = \\frac{24}{x+32}\\]Cross multiply to get\\[\\frac{y(32-x)}{x} (x+32) = \\frac{32y}{x} \\cdot 24\\]Since $x \\ne 0$ and $y \\ne 0$,\\[(32-x)(32+x) = 32 \\cdot 24\\]\\[32^2 - x^2 = 32 \\cdot 24\\]\\[32 \\cdot 8 = x^2\\]Thus, $x = \\boxed{16}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In parallelogram $ABCD$, $AB = 38$ cm, $BC = 3y^3$ cm, $CD = 2x +4$ cm, and $AD = 24$ cm. What is the product of $x$ and $y$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since opposite sides of a parallelogram have the same length, we have the equations $$AB=CD\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad38=2x+4\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad x=17$$and $$BC=AD\\qquad\\Rightarrow \\qquad3y^3=24\\qquad\\Rightarrow\\qquad y=2.$$The product of $x$ and $y$ is then $17\\cdot2=\\boxed{34}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In $\\Delta ABC$, $\\overline{DE} \\parallel \\overline{AB}, CD = 4$ cm, $DA = 10$ cm, and $CE = 6$ cm. What is the number of centimeters in the length of $\\overline{CB}$?\n\n[asy]pair A,B,C,D,E;\nA = (-2,-4); B = (4,-4); C = (0,0); D = A/3; E = B/3;\ndraw(E--D--C--B--A--D);\nlabel(\"A\",A,W); label(\"B\",B,dir(0)); label(\"C\",C,N); label(\"D\",D,W);\n\nlabel(\"E\",E,dir(0));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since $DE \\parallel AB,$ we know that $\\angle CDE = \\angle CAB$ and $\\angle CED = \\angle CBA.$ Therefore, by AA similarity, we have $\\triangle ABC \\sim DEC.$ Then, we find: \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{CB}{CE} &= \\frac{CA}{CD} = \\frac{CD + DA}{CD}\\\\\n\\frac{CB}{6\\text{ cm}} &= \\frac{4\\text{ cm} + 10\\text{ cm}}{4\\text{ cm}} = \\frac{7}{2}\\\\\nCB &= 6\\text{cm} \\cdot \\frac{7}{2} = \\boxed{21}\\text{ cm}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The points $A(2,5), B(6,5), C(5,2)$ and $D(1,2)$ are the vertices of a parallelogram. If the parallelogram is translated down 2 units and right three units, what will be the coordinates of the final image of point $B$?\n\nAnswer:\n",
