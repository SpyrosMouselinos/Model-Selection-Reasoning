    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The rectangle with vertices $(-1, y), (7, y), (-1, 3)$, and $(7, 3)$ has an area of 72 square units, and $y$ is positive. What is the value of $y$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n First we write the rectangle's side lengths in terms of the coordinates provided. The length is $7-(-1)=8$ and the height is $y-3.$ It follows that $8(y-3)=72,$ and $y=\\boxed{12}.$ [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(4cm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nxaxis(Arrows(4));\nyaxis(ymin=-2,Arrows(4));\npair A=(-1,12), B=(7,12), C=(-1,3), D=(7,3);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--D--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$8$\",(A+B)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$y-3$\",(B+D)/2,E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Given that the diagonals of a rhombus are always perpendicular bisectors of each other, what is the area of a rhombus with side length $\\sqrt{89}$ units and diagonals that differ by 6 units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Because the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, they divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.  Let $x$ be half of the length of the shorter diagonal of the rhombus.  Then $x+3$ is half of the length of the longer diagonal.  Also, $x$ and $x+3$ are the lengths of the legs of each of the right triangles.  By the Pythagorean theorem,  \\[\nx^2+(x+3)^2=\\left(\\sqrt{89}\\right)^2.\n\\] Expanding $(x+3)^2$ as $x^2+6x+9$ and moving every term to the left-hand side, the equation simplifies to $2x^2+6x-80=0$.  The expression $2x^2+6x-80$ factors as $2(x-5)(x+8)$, so we find $x=5$ and $x=-8$.  Discarding the negative solution, we calculate the area of the rhombus by multiplying the area of one of the right triangles by 4. The area of the rhombus is $4\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 5(5+3)\\right)=\\boxed{80}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(3mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7pt)+fontsize(11pt));\ndotfactor=3;\npair A=(8,0), B=(0,5), C=(-8,0), D=(0,-5), Ep = (0,0);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(B--D);\nlabel(\"$x$\",midpoint(Ep--B),W);\nlabel(\"$x+3$\",midpoint(Ep--A),S);\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{89}$\",midpoint(A--B),NE);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of square units in the area of trapezoid ABCD with vertices A(0,0), B(0,-2), C(4,0), and D(4,6)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plot the plots and observe that the bases of the trapezoid are $AB$ and $CD$.  The area of the trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the bases times the height: $\\frac{1}{2}(AB+CD)(AC)=\\frac{1}{2}(2+6)(4)=\\boxed{16}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\npair A=(0,0), B=(0,-2), C=(4,0), D=(4,6);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\nxaxis(-3,8,Arrows(4));\nyaxis(-3,8,Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two vertices of an obtuse triangle are $(6,4)$ and $(0,0)$. The third vertex is located on the negative branch of the $x$-axis. What are the coordinates of the third vertex if the area of the triangle is 30 square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that, for a triangle, area = 1/2(base)(height), which equals 30 in this problem. We also know that the height of the triangle is 4 if we use the horizontal leg on the x-axis as the base. Now we can plug this information into the equation to find the length of the base that runs along the x-axis. The equation is $(1/2)(b)(4) = 30$, so $b = 30/2 = 15$. Since the 3rd vertex is on the x-axis we know that it extends straight left 15 units from the vertex at (0, 0), bringing us to the point $\\boxed{(-15, 0)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Square $ABCD$ has side length $1$ unit.  Points $E$ and $F$ are on sides $AB$ and $CB$, respectively, with $AE = CF$.  When the square is folded along the lines $DE$ and $DF$, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide and lie on diagonal $BD$.  The length of segment $AE$ can be expressed in the form $\\sqrt{k}-m$ units. What is the integer value of $k+m$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We start by drawing a diagram.  When the paper is folded, sides $AD$ and $CD$ coincide on the longer dashed line, and points $A$ and $C$ meet at $G$, as you can see below.  [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1)--(0,1)--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(1,.4)); draw((0,0)--(.4,1));\ndraw((1,.4)--(.4,1),dashed);\ndraw((0,0)--(.7,.7),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(0,1), NW); label(\"$B$\",(1,1), NE); label(\"$C$\",(1,0), SE); label(\"$D$\",(0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"$F$\",(1,.4), E); label(\"$E$\",(.4,1), N);\nlabel(\"$G$\",(.7,.7), NE);\n[/asy] Now, we assign variables.  We are looking for the length of $AE$, so let $AE=x$.  Then, $BE=1-x$.  Because of the symmetry of the square and the fold, everything to the left of line $BD$ is a mirror image of everything to the right of $BD$.  Thus, $\\triangle BEF$ is an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90), so $EF=\\sqrt{2}EB = \\sqrt{2}(1-x)$.  Also, $\\triangle EGB$ and $\\triangle FGB$ are congruent 45-45-90 triangles, so $GB = \\frac{EB}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nAlso, notice that because the way the paper is folded (its original position versus its final position), we have more congruent triangles, $\\triangle AED \\cong \\triangle GED$.  This means that $AD=GD=1$.\n\nLastly, notice that since $G$ is on $BD$, we have $BD=BG+GD$. $BD$ is a diagonal of the square, so it has side length $\\sqrt{2}$, $GD=1$, and $GB = \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}$.  Thus, our equation becomes \\[\\sqrt{2} = 1 + \\frac{(1-x)}{\\sqrt{2}}.\\] Multiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{2}$ yields $2=\\sqrt{2}+1-x$; solving for $x$ yields $x=\\sqrt{2}-1$.  Thus, $AE=\\sqrt{2}-1=\\sqrt{k}-m$, and we see that $k+m=2+1=\\boxed{3}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two of the altitudes of an acute triangle divide the sides into segments of lengths $5,3,2$ and $x$ units, as shown. What is the value of $x$?

So $$\\frac{CE}{CD} = \\frac{AC}{BC}.$$ Plugging in values, we have $$\\frac23 = \\frac{8}{x+2}.$$ Solving this gives $x+2 = 12,$ or $x = \\boxed{10}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The area of rectangle $ABCD$ with vertices $A$(0, 0), $B$(0, 4), $C$($x$, 4) and $D$($x$, 0) is 28 square units. If $x > 0$, what is the value of $x$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the points, we see that the dimensions of the rectangle are $x$ and $4$.  The area of the rectangle is $(\\text{length})(\\text{width})=4x$, so $4x=28$ and $x=\\boxed{7}$.

Set $S$ is the set of all line segments that have length 2 and whose endpoints are on adjacent sides of the square. The midpoints of the line segments in set $S$ enclose a region whose area to the nearest hundredth is $k$. Find $100k$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Without loss of generality, let $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(2,2)$ be the vertices of the square. Suppose the endpoints of the segment lie on the two sides of the square determined by the vertex $(0,0)$. Let the two endpoints of the segment have coordinates $(x,0)$ and $(0,y)$. Because the segment has length 2, $x^2+y^2=4$. Using the midpoint formula, we find that the midpoint of the segment has coordinates $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Let $d$ be the distance from $(0,0)$ to $\\left(\\frac{x}{2},\\frac{y}{2}\\right)$. Using the distance formula we see that $d=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2}= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}\\left(x^2+y^2\\right)}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}(4)}=1$. Thus the midpoints lying on the sides determined by vertex $(0,0)$ form a quarter-circle with radius 1.\n[asy] size(100); pointpen=black;pathpen = black+linewidth(0.7); pair A=(0,0),B=(2,0),C=(2,2),D=(0,2); D(A--B--C--D--A);  picture p; draw(p,CR(A,1));draw(p,CR(B,1));draw(p,CR(C,1));draw(p,CR(D,1)); clip(p,A--B--C--D--cycle); add(p); [/asy]\nThe set of all midpoints forms a quarter circle at each corner of the square. The area enclosed by all of the midpoints is $4-4\\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right)=4-\\pi \\approx .86$ to the nearest hundredth. Thus $100\\cdot k=\\boxed{86}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n For $x > 0$, the area of the triangle with vertices $(0, 0), (x, 2x)$, and $(x, 0)$ is 64 square units. What is the value of $x$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the given points, we find that the triangle is a right triangle whose legs measure $x$ and $2x$ units.  Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(2x)=64$, which we solve to find $x=\\boxed{8}$ units.

Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The points $(4, 0)$ and $(-4, 0)$ are two non-consecutive vertices of a rhombus with an area of $80$ square units.
