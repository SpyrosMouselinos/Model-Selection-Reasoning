    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two cylindrical cans have the same volume. The height of one can is triple the height of the other. If the radius of the narrower can is 12 units, how many units are in the length of the radius of the wider can? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the wide can be $h$ and the height of the narrow can be $3h$.  Let the wide can have radius $x$ units.  Since the two volumes are equal, we have \\[\\pi (12^2) (3h) = \\pi (x^2) (h).\\] Solving yields $x = 12\\sqrt{3}$ so the wide can has radius $\\boxed{12\\sqrt{3}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Either increasing the radius or the height of a cylinder by six inches will result in the same volume. The original height of the cylinder is two inches. What is the original radius in inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the original radius be $r$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased radius is $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2$. The volume of the cylinder with the increased height is $\\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Since we are told these two volumes are the same, we have the equation $\\pi \\cdot (r+6)^2 \\cdot 2 = \\pi \\cdot r^2 \\cdot 8$. Simplifying, we have $(r+6)^2=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2+12r+36=4r^2 \\Rightarrow r^2-4r-12=0$. Factoring, we have $(r-6)(r+2)=0$, so $r=\\boxed{6}$ (it cannot be negative because it is a physical length).\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A spherical scoop of vanilla ice cream with radius of 2 inches is dropped onto the surface of a dish of hot chocolate sauce. As it melts, the ice cream spreads out uniformly forming a cylindrical region 8 inches in radius. Assuming the density of the ice cream remains constant, how many inches deep is the melted ice cream? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ice cream sphere has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3) = \\frac{32\\pi}{3}$ cubic inches.  Let the height of the cylindrical region be $h$; then, the volume of the cylindrical region is $\\pi (8^2)h=64\\pi h$.  Thus, we have \\[\\frac{32\\pi}{3} = 64\\pi h.\\] Dividing both sides by $64\\pi$ yields $h = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two congruent cones with radius 12 cm and height 12 cm are enclosed within a cylinder. The base of each cone is a base of the cylinder, and the height of the cylinder is 24 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cylinder not occupied by the cones? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cylinder has volume $\\pi (12)^2 (24)$ cubic cm.  Each cone has volume $(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12)$ cubic cm.  Hence the volume of the space in the cylinder not occupied by the cones is  \\begin{align*}\n\\pi (12)^2 (24) - (2)(1/3)\\pi (12)^2(12) &= 12^3\\pi(2-2/3)\\\\\n&=12^3\\pi(4/3)\\\\\n&=\\boxed{2304\\pi} \\text{ cubic cm}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cylindrical glass is half full of lemonade. The ratio of lemon juice to water in the lemonade is 1:11. If the glass is 6 inches tall and has a diameter of 2 inches, what is the volume of lemon juice in the glass? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can begin by calculating the volume of the liquid in the glass.  Since the glass is half full, the portion filled with liquid has height 3 inches.  The volume will be $\\pi r^2 h=\\pi\\cdot 1^2 \\cdot 3 = 3\\pi$.  Now, since the ratio of lemon juice to water is 1:11, the ratio of lemon juice to the liquid will be 1:(1+11) which is 1:12.  So, the volume of lemon juice in the glass is: $$3\\pi \\cdot \\frac{1}{12}=\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\approx .7854$$ So, the answer is $\\boxed{.79}$ to the nearest hundredth.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cylinder with its diameter equal to its height is inscribed in a right circular cone. The cone has diameter 10 and altitude 12, and the axes of the cylinder and cone coincide. Find the radius of the cylinder. Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cylinder have radius $r$ and height $2r$. Since $\\triangle APQ$ is similar to $\\triangle AOB$, we have $$\\frac{12-2r}{r} = \\frac{12}{5}, \\text{ so } r = \\boxed{\\frac{30}{11}}.$$[asy]\ndraw((0,2)..(-6,0)--(6,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,-2)..(-6,0)--(6,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,1)..(-3,0)--(3,0)..cycle);\ndraw((0,-1)..(-3,0)--(3,0)..cycle);\nfill((-6,0.01)--(-6,-0.01)--(6,-0.01)--(6,0.01)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,14)--(0,0)--(6,0),dashed);\ndraw((0,8)..(-3,7)--(3,7)..cycle);\ndraw((0,6)..(-3,7)--(3,7)..cycle);\nfill((-3,7.01)--(-3,6.99)--(3,6.99)--(3,7.01)--cycle,white);\ndraw((0,7)--(3,7),dashed);\ndraw((-6,0)--(0,14)--(6,0));\ndraw((-3,0)--(-3,7));\ndraw((3,0)--(3,7));\nlabel(\"{\\tiny O}\",(0,0),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny B}\",(6,0),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny P}\",(0,7),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny Q}\",(3,7),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny A}\",(0,14),E);\ndraw((0,-2.5)--(6,-2.5),Arrows);\ndraw((-6.5,0)--(-6.5,14),Arrows);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 5}\",(3,-2.5),S);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12}\",(-6.5,7),W);\ndraw((10,0)--(15,0)--(10,12)--cycle);\ndraw((10,6)--(12.5,6));\ndraw((15.5,0)--(15.5,12),Arrows);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny O}\",(10,0),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny P}\",(10,6),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny A}\",(10,12),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 2r}\",(10,3),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12-2r}\",(10,9),W);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny B}\",(15,0),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny Q}\",(12.5,6),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 12}\",(15.5,6),E);\nlabel(\"{\\tiny 5}\",(12.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A round pizza is $\\frac13$ of an inch thick and has a diameter of 12 inches.

The cup will be a right circular cone with a three-inch radius. How tall will the cup need to be to hold 93 cubic inches of water? Express your answer to the nearest whole number.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\] Therefore, we want $h$ to satisfy \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot h \\ge 93,\\] or \\[h \\ge \\frac{93}{3 \\pi} \\approx 9.87.\\] Therefore, the height must be $\\boxed{10}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The interior of a right, circular cone is 8 inches tall with a 2-inch radius at the opening.

Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of the cone is $\\frac13\\cdot4\\pi\\cdot8=\\frac{32}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches, and the volume of the hemisphere is $\\frac23\\cdot8\\pi=\\frac{16}{3}\\pi$. The sum is \\[\n\\left(\\frac{16}{3}+\\frac{32}{3}\\right)\\pi=\\boxed{16\\pi}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cylindrical can that is six inches high has a label that is $60\\pi$ square inches in area and exactly covers the outside of the can excluding the top and bottom lids.
