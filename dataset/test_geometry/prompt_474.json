    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone has radius 1 inch and height 4 inches, What is the number of inches in the radius of a sphere of ice cream which has the same volume as the cone?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$; here, our cone has volume $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi (1^2)(4)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$.  A sphere with radius $r$ has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, so we set up the equation \\[\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi.\\] Solving for $r$ yields $r^3=1$, so $r = 1$.  The sphere's radius is $\\boxed{1}$ inch.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The interior of a right, circular cone is 8 inches tall with a 2-inch radius at the opening. The interior of the cone is filled with ice cream, and the cone has a hemisphere of ice cream exactly covering the opening of the cone. What is the volume of ice cream? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of the cone is $\\frac13\\cdot4\\pi\\cdot8=\\frac{32}{3}\\pi$ cubic inches, and the volume of the hemisphere is $\\frac23\\cdot8\\pi=\\frac{16}{3}\\pi$. The sum is \\[\n\\left(\\frac{16}{3}+\\frac{32}{3}\\right)\\pi=\\boxed{16\\pi}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A spherical scoop of vanilla ice cream with radius of 2 inches is dropped onto the surface of a dish of hot chocolate sauce. As it melts, the ice cream spreads out uniformly forming a cylindrical region 8 inches in radius. Assuming the density of the ice cream remains constant, how many inches deep is the melted ice cream? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ice cream sphere has volume $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2^3) = \\frac{32\\pi}{3}$ cubic inches.  Let the height of the cylindrical region be $h$; then, the volume of the cylindrical region is $\\pi (8^2)h=64\\pi h$.  Thus, we have \\[\\frac{32\\pi}{3} = 64\\pi h.\\] Dividing both sides by $64\\pi$ yields $h = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A large sphere has a volume of $288\\pi$ cubic units.  A smaller sphere has a volume which is $12.5\\%$ of the volume of the larger sphere.  What is the ratio of the radius of the smaller sphere to the radius of the larger sphere? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We know that the two spheres are similar (in the same sense that triangles are similar) because corresponding parts are in proportion. We will prove that for two spheres that are similar in the ratio $1:k$, their volumes have the ratio $1:k^3$. Let the radius of the first sphere be $r$, so the radius of the other sphere is $kr$. The volume of the first sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$ and the volume of the second sphere is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (kr)^3$. The ratio between the two volumes is  \\[\\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi (kr)^3}=\\frac{r^3}{k^3r^3}=\\frac{1}{k^3}\\] Thus, the ratio of the volumes of the two spheres is $1:k^3$.\n\nIn this problem, since the smaller sphere has $12.5\\%=\\frac{1}{8}$ of the volume of the larger sphere, the radius is $\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{1}{8}}=\\frac{1}{2}$ that of the larger sphere. Thus, the ratio between the two radii is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.\n\n(In general, the ratio of the volumes of two similar 3-D shapes is the cube of the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides.)\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right cone has a base with a circumference of $16\\pi$ inches and a height of 30 inches. The height of this cone is reduced while the circumference stays the same. The volume of the shorter cone is $192\\pi$ cubic inches. What is the ratio of the shorter height to the original height? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the cone have radius $r$ inches; we have $2\\pi r = 16\\pi$, so $r = 8$.  Let the new height of the cone be $h$ inches.  We have $192\\pi = (1/3)\\pi(8^2)(h)$; solving yields $h = 9$.  Thus the ratio of the new height to the original height is $9/30 = \\boxed{\\frac{3}{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone has a volume of $12\\pi$ cubic centimeters. The height of the cone is 4 cm. How many centimeters is the circumference of the base of the cone, in terms of $\\pi$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a cone is $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h$. We're given that the volume is $12\\pi$ and the height is $4$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 \\cdot 4 = 12\\pi$. Solving for $r$, we find $r = 3$. Therefore, the circumference of the base is $2\\pi r = \\boxed{6\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube. What is the ratio of the volume of the inscribed sphere to the volume of the cube? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(60);\ndraw(Circle((6,6),4.5));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,6.9)..(1.5,6),linetype(\"2 4\"));\ndraw((10.5,6)..(6,5.1)..(1.5,6));\ndraw((0,0)--(9,0)--(9,9)--(0,9)--cycle);\ndraw((0,9)--(3,12)--(12,12)--(9,9));\ndraw((12,12)--(12,3)--(9,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(3,3)--(12,3),dashed); draw((3,3)--(3,12),dashed);\n[/asy]\n\nLet the side length of the cube be $s$.  The side length of the cube is equal to diameter of the inscribed sphere, so the radius of the sphere has length $\\frac{s}{2}$.  Thus, the volume of the sphere is equal to $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{\\pi s^3}{6}$ and the volume of the cube is equal to $s^3$.  Hence the ratio of the sphere's volume to the cube's volume is $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{6}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone is sliced into four pieces by planes parallel to its base, as shown in the figure. All of these pieces have the same height. What is the ratio of the volume of the second-largest piece to the volume of the largest piece? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, w, x, y, z;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(.25,.75);\nC=(.5,1.5);\nD=(.75,2.25);\nE=(1,3);\nF=(1.25,2.25);\nG=(1.5,1.5);\nH=(1.75,.75);\nI=(2,0);\nw=(A+I)/2;\nx=(B+H)/2;\ny=(C+G)/2;\nz=(D+F)/2;\ndraw(ellipse(w, 1, .25));\ndraw(ellipse(x, .75, .1875));\ndraw(ellipse(y, .5, .125));\ndraw(ellipse(z, .25, .0625));\ndraw(A--E--I);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the height of the smallest cone (the one on top) be $h$ and let the radius of the circular base of that cone be $r$. Consider the 4 cones in the diagram: the smallest one on top (cone A), the top 2 pieces (cone B), the top 3 pieces (cone C), and all 4 pieces together (cone D). Because each piece of the large cone has the same height as the smallest cone and the same angle and vertex at the top, each of the 4 cones is a dilation of the smaller cone at the top. In other words, all four cones are similar. Because cone B has height twice that of cone A, its circular base has twice the radius as that of A. Likewise, cone C has three times the height, and thus 3 times the radius, and cone D has 4 times the height and 4 times the radius. Thus, using the formula for the volume of a cone, we get  \\begin{align*}\nV_B&=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (2r)^2 (2h)=\\frac{8}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\\\\nV_C&=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (3r)^2 (3h)=\\frac{27}{3} \\pi r^2 h \\\\\nV_D&=\\frac{1}{3} \\pi (4r)^2 (4h)=\\frac{64}{3} \\pi r^2 h \n\\end{align*}Looking at the diagram, we can see that the largest piece will be the volume of cone D minus that of cone C: \\[V_{1}=\\frac{64}{3} \\pi r^2 h-\\frac{27}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{64-27}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{37}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\]Also notice that the volume of the second largest piece is the volume of cone C minus that of cone B: \\[V_{2}=\\frac{27}{3} \\pi r^2 h-\\frac{8}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{27-8}{3} \\pi r^2 h=\\frac{19}{3} \\pi r^2 h.\\]Thus, the ratio of the volume of the second largest piece to that of the largest piece is \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{V_2}{V_1}=\\frac{\\frac{19}{3} \\pi r^2 h}{\\frac{37}{3} \\pi r^2 h} \n=\\frac{\\frac{19}{\\cancel{3}} \\cancel{\\pi} \\cancel{r^2} \\cancel{h}}{\\frac{37}{\\cancel{3}} \\cancel{\\pi} \\cancel{r^2} \\cancel{h}} \n=\\boxed{\\frac{19}{37}}.\n\\end{align*}\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone having a diameter of 10cm and a height of 6cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The radius of the base of the cone is $10/2 = 5$, so the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{50 \\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n An ice cream cone consists of a sphere of vanilla ice cream and a right circular cone that  has the same diameter as the sphere. If the ice cream  melts, it will exactly fill the cone.  Assume that the melted ice cream occupies $75\\%$ of the volume of the frozen ice cream. What is the ratio of the cone's height to its radius? (Note: A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $\\pi r^2 h/3$, and a sphere with radius $r$ has volume $4\\pi r^3/3$.)\n\nAnswer:\n",
