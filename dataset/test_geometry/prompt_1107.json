    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is circumscribed about an equilateral triangle with side lengths of $9$ units each.  What is the area of the circle, in square units? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8));\ndraw((0,0)--(4.5,7.794)--(9,0)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((4.5,2.598),5.196));\ndraw((4.5,7.794)--(4.5,0));\ndot((4.5,2.598));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(4.5,2.598),W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(4.5,7.794),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(9,0),E);\nlabel(\"$M$\",(4.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\n\nAbove is the diagram implied by the problem, with some added lines ($O$ is the center of the circle). Since $\\triangle AMB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and $AB=9$, $AM=4.5\\sqrt{3}$. Since $AO$ is $2/3$ of $AM$, $AO=3\\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the area of the circle is $\\pi(3\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{27\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square has sides of length 10, and a circle centered at one of its vertices has radius 10.  What is the area of the union of the regions enclosed by the square and the circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The areas of the regions enclosed by the square and the circle are $10^{2}=100$ and $\\pi(10)^{2}= 100\\pi$, respectively. One quarter of the second region is also included in the first, so the area of the union is \\[\n100+ 100\\pi -25\\pi= \\boxed{100+75\\pi}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular hexagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 2 units. In square units, what is the area of the hexagon? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect opposite pairs of vertices of the regular hexagon with line segments as shown.  Since each angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees, the six triangles produced are equilateral.  The diameter of the circle circumscribed around the hexagon is equal to twice the side length of each of the triangles.  Therefore, each triangle has side length 2 units.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ units is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$ square units.  (To show this, divide the equilateral triangle into two smaller 30-60-90 triangles.)  Substituting $s=2$, we find that the area of each triangle is $\\sqrt{3}$ square units.  Therefore, area of the hexagon is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(3.5cm);\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\n\nfor(i=0;i<=5;i=i+1)\n\n{\n\ndot((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\ndraw((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6))--(cos(2*pi*(i+1)/6),sin(2*pi*(i+1)/6)));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\n}\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle whose area is $324\\pi$ square units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that since the area is $\\pi r^2 = 324 \\pi$, where $r$ is the radius, we must have $r=\\sqrt{324}=18$. Thus the distance from the center of the hexagon to a vertex is $18$, and we can break up the hexagon into $6$ equilateral triangles, each of which has side length $18$. The area of an equilateral triangle of side length $s$ is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$, so the area of each equilateral triangle is $81 \\sqrt{3}$, making the total $6(81 \\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{486 \\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Suppose $ABC$ is a scalene right triangle, and $P$ is the point on   hypotenuse $\\overline{AC}$ such that $\\angle{ABP} =\n45^{\\circ}$. Given that $AP = 1$ and $CP = 2$, compute the area of   $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\npair A,B,C,P;\n\nB = (0,0);\nA = (0,1);\nC = (2,0);\nP = A + (C-A)/3;\ndraw(P--B--A--C--B);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SW);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SE);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,NE);\n[/asy]\n\n\nNotice that $\\overline{BP}$ bisects the right angle at $B$. Thus, the Angle Bisector Theorem tells us that $AB/BC = AP/PC = 1/2$. So, we have $AB = x$ and $BC = 2x$ for some $x$.  By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $5x^2 =AC^2 = 9$, so $x^2 = \\frac95$.  Finally, the desired area $\\frac{1}{2}(x)(2x) = x^2 = \\boxed{\\frac{9}{5}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square and four circles, each with a radius of 5 inches, are arranged as shown. What is the area, in square inches, of the square? [asy]\nunitsize(1mm);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7pt));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(20,0)--(20,20)--(0,20)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((5,5),5));\ndraw(Circle((15,5),5));\ndraw(Circle((5,15),5));\ndraw(Circle((15,15),5));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The side length of the square is equal to twice the diameter of one of the circles, so the area of the square is $(20\\text{ in})(20\\text{ in})=\\boxed{400}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A parallelogram has adjacent sides of lengths $s$ units and $2s$ units forming a 45-degree angle. The area of the parallelogram is $8\\sqrt 2$ square units. What is the value of $s$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If we let the side of length $2s$ be the base of the parallelogram, we can use our 45-degree angle to find the height of the parallelogram. The height and sides of the parallelogram form a 45-45-90 triangle, with the side of length $s$ as the hypotenuse. Thus, the height of the parallelogram is $s/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nIt follows that the area of the parallelogram is $2s\\cdot (s/\\sqrt{2}) = s^2\\sqrt{2} = 8\\sqrt{2}$, so $s^2 = 8$. Taking the square root of both sides, we see that $s = \\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The vertices of a square are the centers of four circles as shown below. Given each side of the square is 6cm and the radius of each circle is $2\\sqrt{3}$cm, find the area in square centimeters of the shaded region. [asy]\nfill( (-1,-1)-- (1,-1) -- (1,1) -- (-1,1)--cycle, gray);\nfill( Circle((1,1), 1.2), white);\nfill( Circle((-1,-1), 1.2), white);\nfill( Circle((1,-1),1.2), white);\nfill( Circle((-1,1), 1.2), white);\ndraw( Arc((1,1),1.2 ,180,270));\ndraw( Arc((1,-1),1.2,90,180));\ndraw( Arc((-1,-1),1.2,0,90));\ndraw( Arc((-1,1),1.2,0,-90));\ndraw( (-1,-1)-- (1,-1) -- (1,1) -- (-1,1)--cycle,linewidth(.8));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nfill( (-1,-1)-- (1,-1) -- (1,1) -- (-1,1)--cycle, gray);\nfill( Circle((1,1), 1.2), white);\nfill( Circle((-1,-1), 1.2), white);\nfill( Circle((1,-1),1.2), white);\nfill( Circle((-1,1), 1.2), white);\ndraw( Arc((1,1),1.2 ,180,270));\ndraw( Arc((1,-1),1.2,90,180));\ndraw( Arc((-1,-1),1.2,0,90));\ndraw( Arc((-1,1),1.2,0,-90));\ndraw( (-1,-1)-- (1,-1) -- (1,1) -- (-1,1)--cycle,linewidth(.8));\ndraw( (-1,1) -- (0,.33), red+linewidth(.8));\ndraw( (-1,1) -- (-.33,0), red+linewidth(.8));\ndraw( (-.33,0) -- (-1,0), blue+linewidth(.8));\ndraw( (0,.33) -- (0,1), blue+linewidth(.8));\n\n[/asy] Look at the right triangle that consists of a blue side, a red side, and a grey side. The grey side has length $3$ (half the length of the square side length). Since the red side has length $2\\sqrt{3}$, by Pythagoras the blue side has length $\\sqrt{3}$; thus, the right triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle, with area $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(3)(\\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\n\nThe two red radii slice out a sector of 30 degrees, with area $\\left(\\frac{30^\\circ}{360^\\circ}\\right)(2\\sqrt{3})^2 \\pi = \\pi$.\n\nThe square consists of 8 right triangles and 4 sectors and one grey shaded area. Thus, the grey shaded area has area \\[6^2 - 8\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) - 4\\pi = \\boxed{36 - 12\\sqrt{3} - 4\\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The side length of the regular hexagon is 10 cm. What is the number of square centimeters in the area of the shaded region? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\n\n[asy]\nsize(100);\n\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\nfill(B--C--E--F--cycle,heavycyan);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Label points $A$, $B$, $C$ as shown below, and let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$. [asy]\n\nsize(120);\npair A,B,C,D,E,F;\nA = dir(0); B = dir(60); C = dir(120); D = dir(180); E = dir(240); F = dir(300);\n\nfill(B--C--E--F--cycle,heavycyan); pair H=(E+C)/2; draw(D--H); draw(E--C); label(\"$A$\",C,NW);label(\"$B$\",D,W);label(\"$C$\",E,SW);label(\"$H$\",H,ESE);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--E--F--A);\n[/asy] Since the hexagon is regular, $\\angle ABC = 120^\\circ$ and $\\angle ABH = \\angle CBH = 120^\\circ / 2 = 60^\\circ$.  Thus, $\\triangle ABH$ and $\\triangle CBH$ are congruent $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ triangles.  These triangles are each half an equilateral triangle, so their short leg is half as long as their hypotenuse.\n\nSince $AB=BC=10$, we have $BH = AB/2 = 5$ and $AH = CH = \\sqrt{10^2-5^2} = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$.  (Notice that this value is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the length of $BH$, the short leg.  In general, the ratio of the sides in a $30^\\circ - 60^\\circ - 90^\\circ$ is $1:\\sqrt{3}:2$, which can be shown by the Pythagorean Theorem.)  Then, $AC = 2\\cdot 5\\sqrt{3} = 10\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe shaded region is a rectangle with base length $10$ and height length $10\\sqrt{3}$; its area is $10\\cdot 10\\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{100\\sqrt{3}}$ square cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Compute $\\sin 45^\\circ$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $45^\\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.\n\n[asy]\n\npair A,C,P,O,D;\n\ndraw((0,-1.2)--(0,1.2),p=black+1.2bp,Arrows(0.15cm));\n\ndraw((-1.2,0)--(1.2,0),p=black+1.2bp,Arrows(0.15cm));\n\nA = (1,0);\n\nO= (0,0);\n\nlabel(\"$x$\",(1.2,0),SE);\n\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,1.2),NE);\n\nP = rotate(45)*A;\n\nD = foot(P,A,-A);\n\ndraw(O--P--D);\n\ndraw(rightanglemark(O,D,P,2));\n\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\n\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,SE);\n\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,NE);\n\n//label(\"$A$\",A,SE);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\n\n[/asy]\n\nTriangle $POD$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, so $DO = DP = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.  Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$, so $\\sin 45^\\circ = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A unit square is rotated $45^\\circ$ about its center.
