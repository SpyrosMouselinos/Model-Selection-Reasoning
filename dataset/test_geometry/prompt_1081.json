Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circular sheet of paper with radius of $6$ cm is cut into three congruent sectors. What is the height of the cone in centimeters that can be created by rolling one of the sections until the edges meet? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The circumference of the whole circle is $2 \\pi \\cdot 6 = 12 \\pi$, so the circumference of the base of the cone is $12 \\pi/3 = 4 \\pi$.  Hence, the radius of the base of the cone is $4 \\pi/(2 \\pi) = 2$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\nfill((0,0)--arc((0,0),1,-60,60)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1));\ndraw((0,0)--dir(60));\ndraw((0,0)--dir(180));\ndraw((0,0)--dir(300));\nlabel(\"$6$\", dir(60)/2, NW);\n[/asy]\n\nThe slant height of the cone is 6 (the radius of the original circle), so by Pythagoras, the height of the cone is $\\sqrt{6^2 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{32} = \\boxed{4 \\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.8 cm);\n\ndraw((-2,0)--(2,0)--(0,4*sqrt(2))--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,4*sqrt(2)));\n\nlabel(\"$2$\", (1,0), S);\nlabel(\"$6$\", (1,2*sqrt(2)), NE);\nlabel(\"$4 \\sqrt{2}$\", (0,0.7*2*sqrt(2)), W);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone having a diameter of 10cm and a height of 6cm? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The radius of the base of the cone is $10/2 = 5$, so the volume of the cone is \\[\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 6 = \\boxed{50 \\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The truncated right circular cone has a large base radius 8 cm and a small base radius of 4 cm. The height of the truncated cone is 6 cm. How many $\\text{cm}^3$ are in the volume of this solid?  [asy]\n\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\n\ndraw(ellipse((0,0),4,1)); draw(ellipse((0,3),2,1/2));\n\ndraw((-3.97,.1)--(-1.97,3.1)^^(3.97,.1)--(1.97,3.1));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\ndraw(ellipse((0,0),4,1)); draw(ellipse((0,3),2,1/2),gray(.7));\n// draw((-3.97,.1)--(-1.97,3.1)^^(3.97,.1)--(1.97,3.1));\ndraw((-3.97,.1)--(0,6.07)--(3.97,.1));\n\ndraw((4,0)--(0,0)--(0,6.07),linewidth(0.8));\ndraw((2,3)--(0,3),linewidth(0.8));\nlabel(\"4\",(2,3)--(0,3),S);\nlabel(\"8\",(4,0)--(0,0),S);\nlabel(\"6\",(0,0)--(0,3),W);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(0,2)--(0,6.07),W);\n[/asy]\n\nWe \"complete\" the truncated cone by adding a smaller, similar cone atop the cut, forming a large cone.  We don't know the height of the small cone, so call it $x$.  Since the small and large cone are similar, we have $x/4=(x+6)/8$; solving yields $x=6$.  Hence the small cone has radius 4, height 6, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(4^2)(6)=32\\pi$ and the large cone has radius 8, height 12, and volume $(1/3)\\pi(8^2)(12)=256\\pi$.  The frustum's volume is the difference of these two volumes, or $256\\pi-32\\pi=\\boxed{224\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A section is cut out of a circular piece of paper having radius four inches, as shown. Points A and B are then glued together to form a right circular cone. What is the circumference of the base of the resulting cone? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.  (The $270^\\circ$ sector forms the cone.)\n\n[asy]import graph;\ndraw(Circle((0,0),42.4),linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(30,30),linewidth(2));\ndraw((0,0)--(30,-30),linewidth(2));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(30,30),E);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(30,-30),E);\nlabel(\"4''\",(15,15),NW);\ndraw((3,3)--(6,0));\ndraw((6,0)--(3,-3));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The circumference of the whole circle is $2 \\pi \\cdot 4 = 8 \\pi$.  Then the circumference of the base of the cone is \\[\\frac{270^\\circ}{360^\\circ} \\cdot 8 \\pi = \\boxed{6 \\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The slant height of a cone is 13 cm, and the height from the vertex to the center of the base is 12 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cone? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We create a right triangle with the slant height as the hypotenuse, the height from the vertex to the center of the base as one of the legs, and a radius as the other leg.  By Pythagorean theorem, the radius measures $\\sqrt{13^2-12^2}=5$ cm.  It follows that the volume of the cone is $(1/3)\\pi(5^2)(12)=\\boxed{100\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone sits on a table, pointing up. The cross-section triangle, perpendicular to the base, has a vertex angle of 60 degrees. The diameter of the cone's base is $12\\sqrt{3}$ inches. A sphere is placed inside the cone so that it is tangent to the sides of the cone and sits on the table. What is the volume, in cubic inches, of the sphere? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the vertex angle of the cross-section triangle measures $60^\\circ$, the cross-section triangle is equilateral.  Also, the cross-section of the sphere inscribed in the cone is a circle tangent to each of the triangle's sides.  Call the vertices of the equilateral triangle $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $O$ be the center of the circle and $D$ and $E$ the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $BC$, respectively.  To find the radius of the circle, divide the 30-60-90 triangle $CDB$ into three smaller congruent 30-60-90 triangles as shown.  Since the area of each of these triangles is smaller by a factor of $3$ than the area of triangle $CDB$, each corresponding side must be smaller by a factor of $\\sqrt{3}$.  Thus $OE=DB/\\sqrt{3}=6$ inches.  Therefore, the volume of the sphere is $V=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{radius})^3=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(\\text{6 inches})^3=\\boxed{288\\pi}$ cubic inches.\n\n[asy]\n\nsize(2.5inch);\n\npair A = (0,0);\npair B = (2,0);\npair C = (1,sqrt(3));\npair O = (1,sqrt(3)/3);\n\ndraw(O--B);\ndraw(O--C);\ndraw(O--(B+C)/2);\ndraw(O--(A+B)/2);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(circle(O,sqrt(3)/3));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(A+B)/2,S);\nlabel(\"$E$\",(B+C)/2,NE);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,W);\nlabel(\"$12\\sqrt{3}$\",(1,-0.2),S);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A frustum of a right circular cone is formed by cutting a small cone off of the top of a larger cone. If a particular frustum has a lower base radius of 6 inches, an upper base radius of 3 inches, and a height of 4 inches, what is its lateral surface area?

So, the sector has arc length $2\\cdot \\pi \\cdot 6 = 12\\pi$ and radius $10$.  A full circle with radius 10 has arc length $2\\cdot \\pi \\cdot 10 = 20\\pi$, so the sector has $\\frac{12\\pi}{20\\pi}=\\frac{3}{5}$ of the circle's arc length and thus has 3/5 of the circle's area.  Thus, the full cone has lateral surface area \\[\\frac{3}{5}\\pi (10^2) = 60\\pi.\\]Similarly, the small removed cone's lateral surface area is a sector with radius 5 and arc length $2\\cdot \\pi \\cdot 3 = 6\\pi$ (which is $3/5$ of the arc length of a full circle with radius 5), so its lateral surface area is \\[\\frac{3}{5}\\pi (5^2)=15\\pi.\\]The lateral surface area of the frustum, in blue, is the full cone's lateral surface area minus the small removed cone's lateral surface area, which is \\[60\\pi-15\\pi=\\boxed{45\\pi}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right circular cone has a volume of $12\\pi$ cubic centimeters.

If the area of the upper base (which is also the base of the small cone) is $25\\pi$ sq cm, then its radius is $5$ cm, and the radius of the lower base is $15$ cm.   The upper base, therefore, has a radius that is $\\frac{1}{3}$ the size of the radius of the smaller base.  Because the slope of the sides of a cone is uniform, the frustum must have been cut off $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way up the cone, so $x$ is $\\frac13$ of the total height of the cone, $H$.  We can now solve for $x$, because we know that the height of the frustum, $24$ cm is $\\frac23$ of the total height. \\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2}{3}H&=24\\\\\nH&=36\\\\\nx&=H\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx&=36\\times\\frac{1}{3}\\\\\nx&=12\n\\end{align*} Therefore, the height of the small cone is $\\boxed{12}$ centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a cylinder is $54\\pi$ $\\text{cm}^3$.
