    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle whose vertices are at $(4, -1)$, $(10, 3)$ and $(4, 5)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Notice how two of the points, $(4,-1)$ and $(4,5)$, lie on the same line parallel through the $y$-axis with $x$-intercept $(4,0)$.  Let these points lie on the base of the triangle, so the base has length $5-(-1)=6$.  The height is the perpendicular distance from $(10,3)$ to this line, which is $10-4=6$.  The area is thus $\\frac{1}{2} (6)(6)=\\boxed{18}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a triangle with vertices at $A(1, 1), B(6, 1), C(3, 7)$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that $AB$ has length 5 and is parallel to the $x$-axis. Therefore, the height of the triangle is the difference in the $y$-coordinates of $A$ and $C$, or $7-1 = 6$. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = \\boxed{15}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The point $A$ $(3,4)$ is reflected over the $x$-axis to $B$. Then $B$ is reflected over the line $y=x$ to $C$. What is the area of triangle $ABC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n When point $A$ is reflected over the $x$-axis, we get point B, which is $(3,-4)$. Reflecting point $B$ over the line $y=x$, we get that point $C$ is $(-4,3)$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is 8. The distance from point $C$ to the line connecting $A$ and $B$ is 7. Now we can draw the following diagram: [asy]\ndraw((0,8)--(0,-8),Arrows);\ndraw((8,0)--(-8,0),Arrows);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,8),N);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(8,0),E);\ndot((3,4));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(3,4),NE);\ndot((3,-4));\nlabel(\"$B$\",(3,-4),SE);\ndot((-4,3));\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-4,3),W);\ndraw((3,4)--(3,-4)--(-4,3)--cycle);\ndraw((-4,3)--(3,3),linetype(\"8 8\"));\n[/asy] We find that the triangle has a height of length 7 and a base of length 8. Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is equal to  $$\\frac{1}{2}bh=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot7\\cdot8=\\boxed{28}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has vertices at $(-3,2),(6,-2),(3,5)$. How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport graph;\nsize(200);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\ndotfactor=4;\nreal x = 7;\npair A=(-3,2), B=(6,-2), C=(3,5);\nfill(A--C--(-3,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(B--C--(6,5)--cycle,gray(0.6));\nfill(A--B--(-3,-2)--cycle,gray(0.6));\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\nxaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\nyaxis(Ticks(\" \",1.0,begin=false,end=false,NoZero,Size=3),Arrows(4),above=true);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(\"$(-3,2)$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$(6,-2)$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$(3,5)$\",C,N);\ndraw((-3,5)--(6,5)--(6,-2)--(-3,-2)--cycle,dotted);[/asy] We find the area of the given triangle by subtracting the sum of the areas of the three shaded triangles in the figure from the area of the rectangle formed by all four triangles.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $9(7)=63$ square units, and the sum of the areas of the shaded triangles is $$\\frac{1}{2}(6)(3)+\\frac{1}{2}(3)(7)+\\frac{1}{2}(4)(9)=37.5$$ square units.  The area of the fourth triangle is $63-37.5=\\boxed{25.5}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of square units in the area of trapezoid ABCD with vertices A(0,0), B(0,-2), C(4,0), and D(4,6)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plot the plots and observe that the bases of the trapezoid are $AB$ and $CD$.  The area of the trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the bases times the height: $\\frac{1}{2}(AB+CD)(AC)=\\frac{1}{2}(2+6)(4)=\\boxed{16}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(6cm);\nimport graph;\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(10));\npair A=(0,0), B=(0,-2), C=(4,0), D=(4,6);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C,D};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle);\nxaxis(-3,8,Arrows(4));\nyaxis(-3,8,Arrows(4));\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SSE);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A quadrilateral in the plane has vertices $(1, 3)$, $(1, 1)$, $(2, 1)$ and $(2006, 2007)$. How many square units is the area of the quadrilateral?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The quadrilateral is shown below: [asy]\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8));\ndraw((1,1)--(2,1)--(10,10.1)--(1,3)--cycle);\ndraw((1,1)--(10,10.1),dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\", (1,1), S);\nlabel(\"$B$\", (2,1), E);\nlabel(\"$C$\", (10,10.1), N);\nlabel(\"$D$\", (1,3), W);\n[/asy] Divide the quadrilateral into two triangles with the dashed line. We will find the area of these two triangles separately. Since $AB$ is horizontal, the area of triangle $ABC$ is half the product of the length $AB$ multiplied by the length of the vertical altitude from $C$ to line $AB$, or $\\frac{1\\cdot2006}{2}=1003$. Since $AD$ is vertical, the area of triangle $ACD$ is half the product of the length $AD$ multiplied by the length of the horizontal altitude from $C$ to line $AD$, or $\\frac{2\\cdot2005}{2}=2005$. The area of the entire quadrilateral is $1003+2005=\\boxed{3008}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ with vertices $A(-2, 0)$, $B(1, 4)$ and $C(-3, 2)$ is reflected over the $y$-axis to form triangle $A'B'C'$. What is the length of a segment drawn from $C$ to $C'$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Reflecting a point over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coordinate.  So if $C$ is $(-3,2)$, $C'$ will be $(3,2)$.  The segment is a horizontal line of length $3+3=\\boxed{6}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ with vertices $A(1, -3)$, $B(-2, 0)$ and $C(4, 3)$ is reflected over the $y$-axis to form triangle $A'B'C'$. What is the length of a segment drawn from $A$ to $A'$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Reflecting a point over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coefficient.  So if $A$ is $(1,-3)$, $A'$ will be $(-1, -3)$.  The segment is a horizontal line of length $1+1=\\boxed{2}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle in a Cartesian coordinate plane has vertices (5, -2), (10, 5) and (5, 5). How many square units are in the area of the triangle? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Plotting the given points in a coordinate plane, we find that the triangle is a right triangle whose legs have length $5-(-2)=7$ and $10-5=5$ units.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})=\\frac{1}{2}(7)(5)=\\boxed{17.5}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\ndefaultpen(linewidth(0.7)+fontsize(8));\ndotfactor = 4;\ndraw((-1,0)--(10,0),Arrows(4));\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,10),Arrows(4));\npair A=(5,-2), B=(10,5), C=(5,5);\npair[] dots = {A,B,C};\ndot(dots);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\nlabel(rotate(90)*\"$5-(-2)$\",(0,0.2)+(A+C)/2,W);\nlabel(\"$10-5$\",(B+C)/2,N);\nlabel(\"$(5,-2)$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$(10,5)$\",B,NE);\nlabel(\"$(5,5)$\",C,NW);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Line $l_1$ has equation $3x - 2y = 1$ and goes through $A = (-1, -2)$. Line $l_2$ has equation $y = 1$ and meets line $l_1$ at point $B$. Line $l_3$ has positive slope, goes through point $A$, and meets $l_2$ at point $C$. The area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $3$. What is the slope of $l_3$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We find the coordinates of point $B$ by solving $3x-2y = 1$ and $y = 1$ simultaneously. With $y=1,$ we get $3x-2=1,$ and so $x=1.$ Thus, $B=(1,1).$ The distance from $A$ to line $l_2$ is $1 - (-2) = 3,$ so we have \\[\\tfrac{1}{2} \\cdot BC \\cdot 3 = [\\triangle ABC] = 3,\\]and thus $BC = 2.$ Therefore, either $C = (3, 1)$ or $C = (-1, 1).$ If $C = (3, 1),$ then the slope of $l_3$ is $\\tfrac{1-(-2)}{3-(-1)} = \\tfrac{3}{4},$ and if $C=(-1,1)$, then $l_3$ is a vertical line, so its slope is undefined. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\tfrac34}.$\n[asy]\nsize(6cm);\npair A=(-1,-2),B=(1,1),C=(3,1),C2=(-1,-1);\nfilldraw(A--B--C--cycle,gray);\ndraw((-4,0)--(5,0), EndArrow); label(\"$x$\",(5,0),E);\ndraw((0,-4)--(0,3),EndArrow); label(\"$y$\",(0,3),N);\nreal l1( real x) { return (3*x-1)/2; }\nreal l2 (real x) { return 1; }\nreal l3 (real x) { return 3/4*x-5/4; }\ndraw(graph(l1, -2, 2),Arrows); draw(graph(l2, -2, 4.5),Arrows); draw(graph(l3, -3, 4),Arrows);\ndot(\"$A$\",A,NW);\ndot(\"$B$\",B,NNW);\ndot(\"$C$\",C,NNW);\nlabel(\"$l_1$\",(2,2.5),N);\nlabel(\"$l_2$\",(-2,1),NW);\nlabel(\"$l_3$\",(3.5,1.5),N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle has vertices $A(-4, -1)$, $B (2, -1)$ and $C(1, 3)$.
