    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is inscribed  in a square, then a square is inscribed  in this circle, and finally, a circle is inscribed  in this square. What is the ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger square?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the radius of the smaller circle be $r$. Then the side length of the smaller square is $2r$. The radius of the larger circle is half the length of the diagonal of the smaller square, so it is $\\sqrt{2}r$. Hence the larger square has sides of length $2\\sqrt{2}r$. The ratio of the area of the smaller circle to the area of the larger square is therefore \\[\n\\frac{\\pi r^2}{\\left(2\\sqrt{2}r\\right)^2} =\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{8}}.\n\\]\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),10),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),14.1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,14.1)--(14.1,0)--(0,-14.1)--(-14.1,0)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-14.1,14.1)--(14.1,14.1)--(14.1,-14.1)--(-14.1,-14.1)--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((0,0)--(-14.1,0),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw((-7.1,7.1)--(0,0),linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{2}r$\",(-6,0),S);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-3.5,3.5),NE);\nlabel(\"$2r$\",(-7.1,7.1),W);\nlabel(\"$2\\sqrt{2}r$\",(0,14.1),N);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square and a circle intersect so that each side of the square contains a chord of the circle equal in length to the radius of the circle. What is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Drawing a diagram and adding $OM$ perpendicular to $AD$, we get\n[asy]\nsize(150);\npair O, A, B, C, D, E, F, M;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(-1,1);\nB=(1,1);\nC=(1,-1);\nD=(-1,-1);\nE=(-1,-.577);\nF=(-1,.577);\nM=(-1,0);\ndraw(circle(O,1.155));\ndraw(A--B);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(C--D);\ndraw(D--A);\ndraw(F--O);\ndraw(O--E);\ndraw(O--M);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"B\", B, NE);\nlabel(\"C\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"D\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"E\", E, SW);\nlabel(\"F\", F, NW);\nlabel(\"O\", O, dir(0));\nlabel(\"M\", M, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (F+O)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", (E+O)/2, SE);\nlabel(\"$r$\", M, W);\n[/asy] First note that $O$ is not only the center of the circle but also the center of the square since the diagram is symmetric. Because the lengths of the sides of triangle $OEF$ are all the same, $OEF$ is equilateral. Thus, because $OM$ is the height of the equilateral triangle, $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Thus, the length of segment $EM$ is $\\frac{r}{2}$. Because $EMO$ is a 30-60-90 right triangle, $MO=EM\\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}=\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Because $OM$ is perpendicular to $AD$ and $O$ is the center of the square, $OM$ is half the length of a side of the square. Thus, the square has side length of $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{\\cancel{2}} \\cdot \\cancel{2}=r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nCalculating the areas of both of the shapes we get $A_{circle}=\\pi r^2$ and $A_{square}=s^2=(r\\sqrt{3})^2=3r^2$. Thus, the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the circle is $\\frac{3r^2}{\\pi r^2}=\\frac{3\\cancel{r^2}}{\\pi \\cancel{r^2}}=\\boxed{\\frac{3}{\\pi}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circle is circumscribed about an equilateral triangle with side lengths of $9$ units each.  What is the area of the circle, in square units? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(100);\ndefaultpen(linewidth(.8));\ndraw((0,0)--(4.5,7.794)--(9,0)--cycle);\ndraw(Circle((4.5,2.598),5.196));\ndraw((4.5,7.794)--(4.5,0));\ndot((4.5,2.598));\nlabel(\"$O$\",(4.5,2.598),W);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(4.5,7.794),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(9,0),E);\nlabel(\"$M$\",(4.5,0),S);\n[/asy]\n\nAbove is the diagram implied by the problem, with some added lines ($O$ is the center of the circle). Since $\\triangle AMB$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and $AB=9$, $AM=4.5\\sqrt{3}$. Since $AO$ is $2/3$ of $AM$, $AO=3\\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the area of the circle is $\\pi(3\\sqrt{3})^2=\\boxed{27\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A square has sides of length 10, and a circle centered at one of its vertices has radius 10.  What is the area of the union of the regions enclosed by the square and the circle? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The areas of the regions enclosed by the square and the circle are $10^{2}=100$ and $\\pi(10)^{2}= 100\\pi$, respectively. One quarter of the second region is also included in the first, so the area of the union is \\[\n100+ 100\\pi -25\\pi= \\boxed{100+75\\pi}.\n\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The number of inches in the perimeter of an equilateral triangle equals the number of square inches in the area of its circumscribed circle. What is the radius, in inches, of the circle? Express your answer in terms of pi and in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the triangle have vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, let $O$ be the center of the circle, and let $D$ be the midpoint of $\n\\overline{BC}$. Triangle $COD$ is a $30 - 60 - 90$ degree triangle. If $r$ is the radius of the circle, then the sides of $\\triangle COD$ are $r$, $\\frac{r}{2}$, and $\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ is $6\\displaystyle\\left(\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\displaystyle\\right)=3r\\sqrt{3}$, and the area of the circle is $\\pi r^{2}$. Thus $3r\\sqrt{3} = \\pi r^{2}$, and $r =\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{\\pi}}$.\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,D,O;\nO=(0,0);\nA=(0,1);\nB=(0.87,-0.5);\nC=(-0.87,-0.5);\nD=(0,-0.5);\ndraw(Circle(O,1),linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(C--O--D--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle,linewidth(0.7));\nlabel(\"$\\frac{r}{2}$\",(0,-0.25),E);\nlabel(\"$\\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{2}$\",(-0.43,-0.5),S);\nlabel(\"$r$\",(-0.43,-0.25),NW);\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,N);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,SE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the area, in square units, of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle whose area is $324\\pi$ square units? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Note that since the area is $\\pi r^2 = 324 \\pi$, where $r$ is the radius, we must have $r=\\sqrt{324}=18$. Thus the distance from the center of the hexagon to a vertex is $18$, and we can break up the hexagon into $6$ equilateral triangles, each of which has side length $18$. The area of an equilateral triangle of side length $s$ is $\\frac{s^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4}$, so the area of each equilateral triangle is $81 \\sqrt{3}$, making the total $6(81 \\sqrt{3}) = \\boxed{486 \\sqrt{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A certain circle's area is $x$ square units, and its circumference is $y$ units. The value of $x + y$ is $80\\pi$. What is the radius of the circle, in units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $r$ is the radius of the circle, we know that $x = \\pi r^2$ and $y = 2\\pi r$. Thus, we have \\begin{align*}\nx + y &= 80\\pi\\\\\n\\pi r^2 + 2\\pi r &= 80\\pi\\\\\nr(r + 2) &= 80.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe want to find two integers whose product is 80, such that one integer is two more than the other. We note that 80 can be factored as $8\\cdot 10$. Therefore, $r = \\boxed{8}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular hexagon is inscribed in a circle of radius 2 units. In square units, what is the area of the hexagon? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Connect opposite pairs of vertices of the regular hexagon with line segments as shown.  Since each angle of a regular hexagon measures 120 degrees, the six triangles produced are equilateral.  The diameter of the circle circumscribed around the hexagon is equal to twice the side length of each of the triangles.  Therefore, each triangle has side length 2 units.  The area of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ units is $s^2\\sqrt{3}/4$ square units.  (To show this, divide the equilateral triangle into two smaller 30-60-90 triangles.)  Substituting $s=2$, we find that the area of each triangle is $\\sqrt{3}$ square units.  Therefore, area of the hexagon is $\\boxed{6\\sqrt{3}}$ square units.\n\n[asy]\nsize(3.5cm);\ndotfactor=4;\nint i;\n\nfor(i=0;i<=5;i=i+1)\n\n{\n\ndot((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\ndraw((cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6))--(cos(2*pi*(i+1)/6),sin(2*pi*(i+1)/6)));\n\ndraw((0,0)--(cos(2*pi*i/6),sin(2*pi*i/6)));\n\n}\ndraw(circle((0,0),1));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A triangle with sides of 5, 12, and 13 has both an inscribed and a circumscribed circle.  What is the distance between the centers of those circles?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the triangle so that $AB = 5$, $AC = 12$, and $BC = 13$.  Let $I$ and $O$ be the incenter and circumcenter of triangle $ABC$, respectively.  Let the incircle of triangle $ABC$ be tangent to sides $BC$, $AC$, and $AB$ at $D$, $E$, and $F$, respectively.\n\n[asy]\nimport geometry;\n\nunitsize(0.4 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, I, O;\n\nA = (5^2/13,5*12/13);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (13,0);\nI = incenter(A,B,C);\nD = (I + reflect(B,C)*(I))/2;\nE = (I + reflect(C,A)*(I))/2;\nF = (I + reflect(A,B)*(I))/2;\nO = (B + C)/2;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(incircle(A,B,C));\ndraw(I--D);\ndraw(I--E);\ndraw(I--F);\ndraw(I--O);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\ndot(\"$D$\", D, S);\ndot(\"$E$\", E, NE);\ndot(\"$F$\", F, NW);\ndot(\"$I$\", I, N);\ndot(\"$O$\", O, S);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle BAC = 90^\\circ$, the circumcenter $O$ of triangle $ABC$ is the midpoint of hypotenuse $BC$.\n\nSince $AE$ and $AF$ are tangents from $A$ to the same circle, $AE = AF$.  Let $x = AE = AF$.  Similarly, let $y = BD = BF$ and $z = CD = CE$.  Then $x + y = AF + BF = AB = 5$, $x + z = AE + CE = AC = 12$, $y + z = BD + CD = BC = 13$.  Solving this system of equations, we find $x = 2$, $y = 3$, and $z = 10$.  Then $DO = BO - BD = BC/2 - y = 13/2 - 3 = 7/2$.\n\nThe inradius $r$ of triangle $ABC$ is given by $r = K/s$, where $K$ is the area of triangle $ABC$, and $s$ is the semi-perimeter.  We see that $K = [ABC] = 1/2 \\cdot AB \\cdot AC = 1/2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 12 = 30$, and $s = (AB + AC + BC)/2 = (5 + 12 + 13)/2 = 15$, so $r = 30/15 = 2$.\n\nHence, by the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $IDO$, \\[IO = \\sqrt{ID^2 + DO^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + \\left( \\frac{7}{2} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{65}{4}} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{2}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A 6 cm by 8 cm rectangle is inscribed in a circle.

By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the diagonal is $\\sqrt{6^2+8^2}=10$ centimeters.  Also, by symmetry the diagonal of the rectangle is a diameter of the circle.  The circumference of the circle is $\\pi\\times (\\text{diameter})=\\boxed{10\\pi}$ centimeters.
