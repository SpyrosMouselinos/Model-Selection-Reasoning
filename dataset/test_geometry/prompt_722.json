    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The side lengths of a triangle are 14 cm, 48 cm and 50 cm. How many square centimeters are in the area of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Shrinking the triangle by dividing every side length by 2, we recognize the resulting set $$\\{7,24,25\\}$$ of side lengths as a Pythagorean triple.  Therefore, the original triangle is also a right triangle, and its legs measure 14 cm and 48 cm.  The area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(14\\text{ cm})(48\\text{ cm})=\\boxed{336}$ square centimeters.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Quadrilateral $ABCD$ has right angles at $B$ and $C$, $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle BCD$, and $AB > BC$. There is a point $E$ in the interior of $ABCD$ such that $\\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle CEB$ and the area of $\\triangle AED$ is $17$ times the area of $\\triangle CEB$. What is $\\tfrac{AB}{BC}$?\n$\\textbf{(A) } 1+\\sqrt{2} \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 2 + \\sqrt{2} \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } \\sqrt{17} \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 2 + \\sqrt{5} \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 1 + 2\\sqrt{3}$\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $CD=1$, $BC=x$, and $AB=x^2$. Note that $AB/BC=x$. By the Pythagorean Theorem, $BD=\\sqrt{x^2+1}$. Since $\\triangle BCD \\sim \\triangle ABC \\sim \\triangle CEB$, the ratios of side lengths must be equal. Since $BC=x$, $CE=\\frac{x^2}{\\sqrt{x^2+1}}$ and $BE=\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+1}}$. Let F be a point on $\\overline{BC}$ such that $\\overline{EF}$ is an altitude of triangle $CEB$. Note that $\\triangle CEB \\sim \\triangle CFE \\sim \\triangle EFB$. Therefore, $BF=\\frac{x}{x^2+1}$ and $CF=\\frac{x^3}{x^2+1}$. Since $\\overline{CF}$ and $\\overline{BF}$ form altitudes of triangles $CED$ and $BEA$, respectively, the areas of these triangles can be calculated. Additionally, the area of triangle $BEC$ can be calculated, as it is a right triangle. Solving for each of these yields:\\[[BEC]=[CED]=[BEA]=(x^3)/(2(x^2+1))\\]\\[[ABCD]=[AED]+[DEC]+[CEB]+[BEA]\\]\\[(AB+CD)(BC)/2= 17*[CEB]+ [CEB] + [CEB] + [CEB]\\]\\[(x^3+x)/2=(20x^3)/(2(x^2+1))\\]\\[(x)(x^2+1)=20x^3/(x^2+1)\\]\\[(x^2+1)^2=20x^2\\]\\[x^4-18x^2+1=0 \\implies x^2=9+4\\sqrt{5}=4+2(2\\sqrt{5})+5\\]Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{2+\\sqrt{5}}$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has sides of length 5, 12 and 13 units, and triangle $DEF$ has sides of length 8, 15 and 17 units. What is the ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $DEF$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ are both right, since their sides form Pythagorean triples. It follows that the desired ratio is $\\dfrac{(5\\cdot 12)/2}{(8\\cdot 15)/2} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A regular octagon $ABCDEFGH$ has sides of length two. Find the area of $\\bigtriangleup ADG$. Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Construct the right triangle $\\bigtriangleup AOB$ as shown in the figure. Since $AB=2$, we have $AO=\\sqrt{2}$ and $AD=2+2\\sqrt{2}$. Similarly, we have $OG=2+\\sqrt{2}$, so \\begin{align*}\n\\text{Area}(\\bigtriangleup ADG)&=\\frac{1}{2}(2+2\\sqrt{2})(2+\\sqrt{2})\\\\&=(1+\\sqrt{2})(2+\\sqrt{2})=\\boxed{4+3\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\end{align*} [asy]\nunitsize(1.75cm);\npair A,B,C,D,I,F,G,H,K;\nA=(0,0);\nB=(1,1);\nK=(1,0);\nC=(2.41,1);\nD=(3.41,0);\nI=(3.41,-1.41);\nF=(2.41,-2.41);\nG=(1,-2.41);\nH=(0,-1.41);\nlabel(\"2\",(1.7,1),N);\nlabel(\"2\",(1.7,0),N);\nlabel(\"2\",(1,-0.7),E);\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{2}$\",(0.5,0),N);\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{2}$\",(2.91,0),N);\nlabel(\"$\\sqrt{2}$\",(1,-1.7),E);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--I--F--G--H--cycle);\ndraw(A--D--G--cycle);\ndraw(H--I);\ndraw(B--G);\ndraw(C--F);\nlabel(\"$O$\",K,NE);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,W);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,N);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I,E);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$G$\",G,S);\nlabel(\"$H$\",H,W);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 22, AC=12,$ and $BC=14$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=24$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24\\cdot 2\\cdot 12\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 24\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$24\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 24,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 16$, $AC = 24$, $BC = 19$, and $AD$ is an angle bisector.  Find the ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$.  (Express your answer as a fraction in lowest terms.)\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The ratio of the area of triangle $ABD$ to the area of triangle $ACD$ is $BD/CD$.  By the angle bisector theorem, $BD/CD = AB/AC = 16/24 = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the area of rhombus $ABCD$ given that the radii of the circles circumscribed around triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$ are $12.5$ and $25$, respectively.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The diagonals of the rhombus perpendicularly bisect each other. Call half of diagonal BD $a$ and half of diagonal AC $b$. The length of the four sides of the rhombus is $\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.\nThe area of any triangle can be expressed as $\\frac{a\\cdot b\\cdot c}{4R}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the sides and $R$ is the circumradius. Thus, the area of $\\triangle ABD$ is $ab=2a(a^2+b^2)/(4\\cdot12.5)$. Also, the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $ab=2b(a^2+b^2)/(4\\cdot25)$. Setting these two expressions equal to each other and simplifying gives $b=2a$. Substitution yields $a=10$ and $b=20$, so the area of the rhombus is $20\\cdot40/2=\\boxed{400}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 7$, $AC = 15$, and the length of median $AM$ is 10.  Find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Extend $AM$ to $D$ so that $MD = MA$.  Then triangles $AMB$ and $DMC$ are congruent, so triangles $ABC$ and $ACD$ have equal area.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, M;\n\nA = (-7/sqrt(37),42/sqrt(37));\nB = (0,0);\nC = (2*sqrt(37),0);\nM = (B + C)/2;\nD = 2*M - A;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D--C);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$7$\", (A + B)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$15$\", (A + C)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (A + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (D + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$7$\", (C + D)/2, E);\n[/asy]\n\nThe semi-perimeter of triangle $ACD$ is $(7 + 15 + 20)/2 = 21$, so by Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ACD$ is $$\\sqrt{21 (21 - 7)(21 - 15)(21 - 20)} = \\boxed{42}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid has a square base with side length 10 cm. Its peak is 12 cm above the center of its base. What is the total surface area of the pyramid, in square centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nimport three;\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\ndraw(P--C);\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\ndraw(P--F--M,dashed);\ndraw(P--M);\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,SW);\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base and $M$ be the midpoint of an edge of the square, as shown.  Since the pyramid is a right pyramid, triangle $PFM$ is a right triangle.  We are given $PF = 12$, and we have $FM = (1/2)(AB) = 5$, so the Pythagorean Theorem gives us $PM = \\sqrt{PF^2 + FM^2} = 13$.  Therefore, since the four lateral faces are congruent triangles, the total surface area of the pyramid is \\[[ABCD] + 4[PAB] = 10^2 + 4(13)(10)/2 = \\boxed{360}\\text{ square centimeters}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n How many units are in the sum of the lengths of the two longest altitudes in a triangle with sides $8,$ $15,$ and $17$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We recognize 8, 15, and 17 as a Pythagorean triple. Since the hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse is the shortest of the altitudes. The other two altitudes are just the legs themselves, therefore $8 + 15 = \\boxed{23}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the area of a triangle with side lengths 13, 17, and $12\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nAnswer:\n",
