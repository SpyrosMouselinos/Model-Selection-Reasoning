    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $P$ and $R$ are located at (2, 1) and (12, 15) respectively. Point $M$ is the midpoint of segment $\\overline{PR}$. Segment $\\overline{PR}$ is reflected over the $x$-axis. What is the sum of the coordinates of the image of point $M$ (the midpoint of the reflected segment)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Point $M$ has coordinates $(7,8)$. Therefore, its image has coordinates $(7,-8)$. Thus the sum is $7-8 = \\boxed{-1}$.\n\nAlternatively, the image of point $M$ is the midpoint of the images of points $P$ and $R$ and thus is the midpoint of $(2,-1)$ and $(12,-15)$, which is also $(7,-8)$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Parallelogram $ABCD$ with $A(2,5)$, $B(4,9)$, $C(6,5)$, and $D(4,1)$ is reflected across the $x$-axis to $A'B'C'D'$ and then $A'B'C'D'$ is reflected across the line $y=x+1$ to $A''B''C''D''$. This is done such that $D'$ is the image of $D$, and $D''$ is the image of $D'$. What is the ordered pair of $D''$ in the coordinate plane?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Reflecting a point across the $x$-axis multiplies its $y$-coordinate by $-1$.  Therefore, $D'=(4,-1)$.  To reflect $D'$ across the line $y=x+1$, we first translate both the line and the point down one unit so that the equation of the translated line is $y=x$ and the coordinates of the translated point are $(4,-2)$.  To reflect across $y=x$, we switch the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate to obtain $(-2,4)$.  Translating this point one unit up, we find that $D''=\\boxed{(-2,5)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $A(-4,1), B(-1,4)$ and $C(-1,1)$ are the vertices of $\\triangle ABC$. What will be the coordinates of the image of point A if $\\triangle ABC$ is rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the origin?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n When we rotate images $90^{\\circ}$ the coordinates switch places, and the signs are adjusted based on whether or not an axis was crossed. In this case, rotating point $A$ $90^{\\circ}$ will bring it across the $y$-axis into Quadrant I, which means both the $x$ and $y$ will be positive. The original point $A$ was at $(-4, 1)$ so the final image will be at $(1, 4)$. We also could solve this problem by seeing that the slope of the segment from the origin to $A$ is $-1/4$. If $A$ is moving to a location that is a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation about the origin, it will move to a point on the segment perpendicular to the one that currently connects it to the origin. This will be the segment that has a slope of 4/1 or $-4/-1$ from the origin which puts us at $(1, 4)$ or $(-1, -4)$. The point $\\boxed{(1, 4)}$ is in the clockwise direction we need.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The image of the point with coordinates $(1,1)$ under the reflection across the line $y=mx+b$ is the point with coordinates $(9,5)$.  Find $m+b$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection.  The slope of the segment is $\\frac{5-1}{9-1}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Since the line of reflection is perpendicular, its slope, $m$, equals $-2$.  By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment are $\\left(\\frac{9+1}2,\\frac{5+1}2\\right)=(5,3)$.   Since the line of reflection goes through this point, we have $3=(-2)(5)+b$, and so $b=13$.  Thus $m+b=-2+13=\\boxed{11}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In quadrilateral $ABCD$, sides $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ both have length 10, sides $\\overline{CD}$ and $\\overline{DA}$ both have length 17, and the measure of angle $ADC$ is $60^\\circ$. What is the length of diagonal $\\overline{AC}$? [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(17,0));\ndraw(rotate(301, (17,0))*(0,0)--(17,0));\npicture p;\ndraw(p, (0,0)--(0,10));\ndraw(p, rotate(115, (0,10))*(0,0)--(0,10));\nadd(rotate(3)*p);\n\ndraw((0,0)--(8.25,14.5), linetype(\"8 8\"));\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", (8.25, 14.5), N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", (-0.25, 10), W);\nlabel(\"$C$\", (0,0), SW);\nlabel(\"$D$\", (17, 0), E);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Triangle $ACD$ is an isosceles triangle with a $60^\\circ$ angle, so it is also equilateral. Therefore, the length of $\\overline{AC}$ is $\\boxed{17}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The points $B(1, 1)$, $I(2, 4)$ and $G(5, 1)$ are plotted in the standard rectangular coordinate system to form triangle $BIG$. Triangle $BIG$ is translated five units to the left and two units upward to triangle $B'I'G'$, in such a way that $B'$ is the image of $B$, $I'$ is the image of $I$, and $G'$ is the image of $G$. What is the midpoint of segment $B'G'$? Express your answer as an ordered pair.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since triangle $B^\\prime I^\\prime G^\\prime$ is translated from triangle $BIG,$ the midpoint of $B^\\prime G ^\\prime $ is the midpoint of $BG$ translated five units left and two units up. The midpoint of $BG$ is at $\\left( \\frac{1+5}{2}, \\frac{1+1}{2} \\right) = (3, 1).$ Thus, the midpoint of $B ^\\prime G ^\\prime$ is at $(3-5,1+2)=\\boxed{(-2,3)}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ with vertices of $A(6,2)$, $B(2,5)$, and $C(2,2)$ is reflected over the x-axis to triangle $A'B'C'$. This triangle is reflected over the y-axis to triangle $A''B''C''$. What are the coordinates of point $C''$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A reflection over the $x$-axis negates the $y$-coordinate, while a reflection over the $y$-axis negates the $x$-coordinate. So reflecting $C$ over the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis means we negate both coordinates to get $\\boxed{(-2, -2)}$ as the coordinates of point $C''$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n $ABCDE$ is a regular pentagon.  $AP$, $AQ$ and $AR$ are the perpendiculars dropped from $A$ onto $CD$, $CB$ extended and $DE$ extended, respectively.  Let $O$ be the center of the pentagon.  If $OP = 1$, then find $AO + AQ + AR$.\n\n[asy]\n\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, O, P, Q, R;\n\nA = dir(90);\n\nB = dir(90 - 360/5);\n\nC = dir(90 - 2*360/5);\n\nD = dir(90 - 3*360/5);\n\nE = dir(90 - 4*360/5);\n\nO = (0,0);\n\nP = (C + D)/2;\n\nQ = (A + reflect(B,C)*(A))/2;\n\nR = (A + reflect(D,E)*(A))/2;\n\ndraw((2*R - E)--D--C--(2*Q - B));\n\ndraw(A--P);\n\ndraw(A--Q);\n\ndraw(A--R);\n\ndraw(B--A--E);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, dir(0));\n\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, W);\n\ndot(\"$O$\", O, dir(0));\n\nlabel(\"$P$\", P, S);\n\nlabel(\"$Q$\", Q, dir(0));\n\nlabel(\"$R$\", R, W);\n\nlabel(\"$1$\", (O + P)/2, dir(0));\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n To solve the problem, we compute the area of regular pentagon $ABCDE$ in two different ways.  First, we can divide regular pentagon $ABCDE$ into five congruent triangles.\n\n[asy]\n\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, O, P, Q, R;\n\nA = dir(90);\n\nB = dir(90 - 360/5);\n\nC = dir(90 - 2*360/5);\n\nD = dir(90 - 3*360/5);\n\nE = dir(90 - 4*360/5);\n\nO = (0,0);\n\nP = (C + D)/2;\n\nQ = (A + reflect(B,C)*(A))/2;\n\nR = (A + reflect(D,E)*(A))/2;\n\ndraw((2*R - E)--D--C--(2*Q - B));\n\ndraw(A--P);\n\ndraw(A--Q);\n\ndraw(A--R);\n\ndraw(B--A--E);\n\ndraw((O--B),dashed);\n\ndraw((O--C),dashed);\n\ndraw((O--D),dashed);\n\ndraw((O--E),dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, dir(0));\n\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, W);\n\ndot(\"$O$\", O, NE);\n\nlabel(\"$P$\", P, S);\n\nlabel(\"$Q$\", Q, dir(0));\n\nlabel(\"$R$\", R, W);\n\nlabel(\"$1$\", (O + P)/2, dir(0));\n\n[/asy]\n\nIf $s$ is the side length of the regular pentagon, then each of the triangles $AOB$, $BOC$, $COD$, $DOE$, and $EOA$ has base $s$ and height 1, so the area of regular pentagon $ABCDE$ is $5s/2$.\n\nNext, we divide regular pentagon $ABCDE$ into triangles $ABC$, $ACD$, and $ADE$.\n\n[asy]\n\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, O, P, Q, R;\n\nA = dir(90);\n\nB = dir(90 - 360/5);\n\nC = dir(90 - 2*360/5);\n\nD = dir(90 - 3*360/5);\n\nE = dir(90 - 4*360/5);\n\nO = (0,0);\n\nP = (C + D)/2;\n\nQ = (A + reflect(B,C)*(A))/2;\n\nR = (A + reflect(D,E)*(A))/2;\n\ndraw((2*R - E)--D--C--(2*Q - B));\n\ndraw(A--P);\n\ndraw(A--Q);\n\ndraw(A--R);\n\ndraw(B--A--E);\n\ndraw(A--C,dashed);\n\ndraw(A--D,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, dir(0));\n\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$E$\", E, W);\n\ndot(\"$O$\", O, dir(0));\n\nlabel(\"$P$\", P, S);\n\nlabel(\"$Q$\", Q, dir(0));\n\nlabel(\"$R$\", R, W);\n\nlabel(\"$1$\", (O + P)/2, dir(0));\n\n[/asy]\n\nTriangle $ACD$ has base $s$ and height $AP = AO + 1$.  Triangle $ABC$ has base $s$ and height $AQ$.  Triangle $ADE$ has base $s$ and height $AR$.  Therefore, the area of regular pentagon $ABCDE$ is also \\[\\frac{s}{2} (AO + AQ + AR + 1).\\]Hence, \\[\\frac{s}{2} (AO + AQ + AR + 1) = \\frac{5s}{2},\\]which means $AO + AQ + AR + 1 = 5$, or $AO + AQ + AR = \\boxed{4}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In rectangle $ABCD$, $P$ is a point on $BC$ so that $\\angle APD=90^{\\circ}$. $TS$ is perpendicular to $BC$ with $BP=PT$, as shown.  $PD$ intersects $TS$ at $Q$.

Therefore, $\\triangle BAP \\sim \\triangle TPQ$.  Since $AB/AP = 4/5$, triangles $BAP$ and $PTQ$ are $\\{3,4,5\\}$ right triangles, and we have $TQ = \\frac35(15) = 9$ and $TP = \\frac45(15)=12$.  Since $ABCD$ is a rectangle and $TS$ is perpendicular to $BC$, then $ABTS$ is also a rectangle. Thus, $TS=BA=16$ and $QS=TS-QT=16-9=7$.\n\nIn triangles $PQT$ and $DQS$, $\\angle PTQ=\\angle DSQ=90^{\\circ}$. Also, $\\angle PQT$ and $\\angle DQS$ are vertically opposite angles and are therefore equal. Therefore, $\\triangle PQT$ and $\\triangle DQS$ are similar triangles. Since $\\triangle PQT$ and $\\triangle DQS$ are similar triangles, the ratios of corresponding side lengths in these two triangles are equal.\n\nThat is, $\\dfrac{SD}{TP}=\\dfrac{QS}{QT}$ or $\\dfrac{SD}{12}=\\dfrac{7}{9}$ or $SD=12\\times\\dfrac{7}{9}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{28}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Quadrilateral MNPQ has vertices with coordinates $M(2,5)$, $N(6, 5)$, $P(6, 7)$ and $Q(2, 7)$.
