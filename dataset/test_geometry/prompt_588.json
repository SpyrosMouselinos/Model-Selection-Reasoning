    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangular prism has dimensions 8 inches by 2 inches by 32 inches. If a cube has the same volume as the prism, what is the surface area of the cube, in square inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cube has volume $8\\cdot2\\cdot32$ cubic inches, so its edge length is $\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot2\\cdot32}=\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot64}=\\sqrt[3]{8}\\sqrt[3]{64}=2\\cdot4=8$ inches.  The surface area of a cube with edge length 8 inches is $6(8\\text{ in.})^2=\\boxed{384}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has a surface area of 216 square centimeters. What is the volume of the cube, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are 6 faces to a cube, meaning that each face has area 36, and the edge has length 6, for a total volume of $6^3 = \\boxed{216}$ for the cube.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Each edge length of a rectangular solid is a prime number. If the volume of the rectangular solid is 385 cubic units, what is the total surface area, in square units, of the rectangular solid?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Prime factorize $385$ as $5\\cdot7\\cdot 11$.  The surface area of a rectangular solid having side lengths of 5, 7, and 11 units is $2(5\\cdot7+7\\cdot11+11\\cdot5)=\\boxed{334}$ square units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube, and the cube has a surface area of 24 square meters. A second cube is then inscribed within the sphere. What is the surface area in square meters of the inner cube?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the surface area of the original cube is 24 square meters, each face of the cube has a surface area of $24/6 = 4$ square meters, and the side length of this cube is 2  meters. The sphere inscribed within the cube has diameter 2 meters,  which is also the length of the diagonal of the cube inscribed in the sphere. Let $l$ represent the side length of the inscribed cube. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice gives \\[\nl^2 + l^2 + l^2 = 2^2 = 4.\n\\]Hence each face has surface area \\[\nl^2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\ \\text{square meters}.\n\\]So the surface area of the inscribed cube is $6\\cdot (4/3) = \\boxed{8}$ square meters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The corner of a unit cube is chopped off such that the cut runs through the three vertices adjacent to the vertex of the chosen corner.  What is the height of the remaining cube when the freshly-cut face is placed on a table?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The major diagonal has a length of $\\sqrt{3}$.  The volume of the pyramid is $1/6$, and so its height $h$ satisfies $\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot h\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(\\sqrt{2})^2=1/6$ since  the freshly cut face is an equilateral triangle of side length $\\sqrt{2}$.  Thus $h=\\sqrt{3}/3$, and the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume in cubic inches of a right, rectangular prism with side, front and bottom faces having an area 15 square inches, 10 square inches and 6 square inches, respectively?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the sides of the prism have lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$. We have the equations $xy=15$, $yz=10$ and $xz=6$. Multiplying these equations together, we have $xy\\cdot yz \\cdot xz = 15\\cdot10\\cdot6 \\Rightarrow x^2y^2z^2=900$. Since the volume of the prism is equal to $xyz$, we take the square root of both sides to get the volume as $\\sqrt{900}=\\boxed{30}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A solid box is 15 cm by 10 cm by 8 cm. A new solid is formed by removing a cube 3 cm on a side from each corner of this box. What percent of the original volume is removed?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The total volume of the eight removed cubes is $8\\times 3^{3}=216$ cubic centimeters, and the volume of the original box is $15\\times 10\\times 8 = 1200$ cubic centimeters. Therefore the volume has been reduced by $\\left(\\frac{216}{1200}\\right)(100\\%) = \\boxed{18\\%}. $\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When each edge of a cube is increased by $50\\%$, by what percent is the surface area of the cube increased?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $s$ represent the length of the edge of a cube. The surface area of the cube is 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces), or $6s^2$. Increasing $s$ by $50\\%$ gives us $1.5s$. The new surface area is $6(1.5s)^2=6s^2(2.25)$. Increasing the surface area by $x\\%$ is $6s^2\\left(1+\\frac{x}{100}\\right)$, so we solve for $x$ when the surface area is $6s^2(2.25)$. $$2.25=1+\\frac{x}{100}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 1.25=\\frac{x}{100}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 125=x$$ The surface area increases by $\\boxed{125\\%}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right pyramid with a square base has total surface area 432 square units.  The area of each triangular face is half the area of the square face. What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $ABCD$ be the base of the pyramid and let $P$ be the pyramid's apex.\n\n[asy]\n\nimport three;\n\ntriple A = (0,0,0);\n\ntriple B = (1,0,0);\n\ntriple C = (1,1,0);\n\ntriple D = (0,1,0);\n\ntriple P = (0.5,0.5,1);\n\ndraw(B--C--D--P--B);\n\ndraw(P--C);\n\ndraw(B--A--D,dashed);\n\ndraw(P--A,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,NW);\n\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,W);\n\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,S);\n\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,E);\n\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,N);\n\ntriple F= (0.5,0.5,0);\n\ntriple M=(B+C)/2;\n\ndraw(P--F--M,dashed);\n\ndraw(P--M);\n\nlabel(\"$F$\",F,S);\n\nlabel(\"$M$\",M,SW);\n\n[/asy]\n\nLet $F$ be the center of the square base and $M$ be the midpoint of an edge of the square, as shown.  There are four triangular faces, each with area half the area of the square face.  So, the total surface area of the pyramid is 3 times the area of the square face.  Therefore, the area of the square face is $432/3=144$ square units, which means that each side of the square has length 12.\n\nSince the area of the triangle is half the area of the square, we have $(BC)(PM)/2 = 72$, so $(BC)(PM) = 144$, which means $PM = 144/12 = 12$.  Since $F$ is the center of the square base, we have $FM = 6$, so $PF = \\sqrt{12^2 - 6^2} = 6\\sqrt{3}$.  Finally, the volume of the pyramid is \\[\\frac{[ABCD]\\cdot PF}{3} = \\frac{144\\cdot 6\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\boxed{288\\sqrt{3}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A right, rectangular prism has three faces with areas of $6,8$ and $12$ square inches. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n If $l$, $w$, and $h$ represent the dimensions of the rectangular prism, we look for the volume $lwh$. We arbitrarily set $lw=6$, $wh=8$, and $lh=12$. Now notice that if we multiply all three equations, we get $l^2w^2h^2=6\\cdot8\\cdot12=3\\cdot2\\cdot2^3\\cdot2^2\\cdot3=2^6\\cdot3^2$. To get the volume, we take the square root of each side and get $lwh=2^3\\cdot3=\\boxed{24}$ cubic inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube of side 3 inches has a cube of side 1 inch cut from each corner. A cube of side 2 inches is then inserted in each corner. What is the number of square inches in the surface area of the resulting solid?\n\nAnswer:\n",
