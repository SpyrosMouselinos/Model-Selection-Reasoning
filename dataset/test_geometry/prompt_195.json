    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A rectangular prism has dimensions 8 inches by 2 inches by 32 inches. If a cube has the same volume as the prism, what is the surface area of the cube, in square inches?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The cube has volume $8\\cdot2\\cdot32$ cubic inches, so its edge length is $\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot2\\cdot32}=\\sqrt[3]{8\\cdot64}=\\sqrt[3]{8}\\sqrt[3]{64}=2\\cdot4=8$ inches.  The surface area of a cube with edge length 8 inches is $6(8\\text{ in.})^2=\\boxed{384}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has a surface area of 216 square centimeters. What is the volume of the cube, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are 6 faces to a cube, meaning that each face has area 36, and the edge has length 6, for a total volume of $6^3 = \\boxed{216}$ for the cube.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the volume, in cubic units, of a cube whose surface area is 600 square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The surface area of a cube equals 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces). If the cube has a sidelength of $s$, then the surface area equals $6s^2$. We set that equal to 600 and solve for $s$, which must be positive. $$600=6s^2\\qquad\\Rightarrow 100=s^2\\qquad\\Rightarrow 10=s$$ The volume of the cube is $s^3=10^3=\\boxed{1000}$ cubic units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The sum of the lengths of all the edges of a cube is 60 cm. Find the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cube.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since there are 12 congruent edges on a cube, each edge has length $60/12=5$ cm. Since the volume of the cube is equal to the edge length cubed, the volume is $5^3=5\\cdot5\\cdot5=\\boxed{125}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When each edge of a cube is increased by $50\\%$, by what percent is the surface area of the cube increased?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $s$ represent the length of the edge of a cube. The surface area of the cube is 6 times the area of each face (since there are 6 faces), or $6s^2$. Increasing $s$ by $50\\%$ gives us $1.5s$. The new surface area is $6(1.5s)^2=6s^2(2.25)$. Increasing the surface area by $x\\%$ is $6s^2\\left(1+\\frac{x}{100}\\right)$, so we solve for $x$ when the surface area is $6s^2(2.25)$. $$2.25=1+\\frac{x}{100}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 1.25=\\frac{x}{100}\\qquad\\Rightarrow 125=x$$ The surface area increases by $\\boxed{125\\%}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A sphere is inscribed in a cube, and the cube has a surface area of 24 square meters. A second cube is then inscribed within the sphere. What is the surface area in square meters of the inner cube?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the surface area of the original cube is 24 square meters, each face of the cube has a surface area of $24/6 = 4$ square meters, and the side length of this cube is 2  meters. The sphere inscribed within the cube has diameter 2 meters,  which is also the length of the diagonal of the cube inscribed in the sphere. Let $l$ represent the side length of the inscribed cube. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem twice gives \\[\nl^2 + l^2 + l^2 = 2^2 = 4.\n\\]Hence each face has surface area \\[\nl^2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\ \\text{square meters}.\n\\]So the surface area of the inscribed cube is $6\\cdot (4/3) = \\boxed{8}$ square meters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the total volume in cubic feet of three boxes if each box is a cube with edge length 4 feet?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each box has volume $4^3=64$ cubic feet. Thus, three boxes have volume $64\\cdot3=\\boxed{192}$ cubic feet.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the value of $x$ if a cube's volume is $5x$ cubic units and its surface area is $x$ square units?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the cube's volume is $5x$ cubic units, each side measures $\\sqrt[3]{5x}$ units. The surface area is then $6(\\sqrt[3]{5x})^2$. We are told the surface area is also $x$. We have the equation $6(\\sqrt[3]{5x})^2=x$ Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\\boxed{5400}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a given sphere is $36\\pi$ cubic inches. How many square inches are in its surface area? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The volume of a sphere with radius $r$ is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.  Here, we have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3=36\\pi$.  Dividing both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ yields $r^3 = 27$; cube rooting both sides yields $r=3$.  The surface area of a sphere with radius $r$ is $4\\pi r^2$; here, our surface area is $4\\pi(3^2)=\\boxed{36\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Three vertices of a cube are $P=(7,12,10)$, $Q=(8,8,1)$, and $R=(11,3,9)$. What is the surface area of the cube?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n $PQ=\\sqrt{(8-7)^2+(8-12)^2+(1-10)^2}=\\sqrt{98}$\n$PR=\\sqrt{(11-7)^2+(3-12)^2+(9-10)^2}=\\sqrt{98}$\n$QR=\\sqrt{(11-8)^2+(3-8)^2+(9-1)^2}=\\sqrt{98}$\nSo, $PQR$ is an equilateral triangle. Let the side of the cube be $a$.\n$a\\sqrt{2}=\\sqrt{98}$\nSo, $a=7$, and hence the surface area is $6a^2=\\boxed{294}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Each edge of a cube has length 3 inches. What is the number of square inches in the cube's total surface area?\n\nAnswer:\n",
