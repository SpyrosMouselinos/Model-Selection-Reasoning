    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 22, AC=12,$ and $BC=14$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=24$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24\\cdot 2\\cdot 12\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{24^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 24\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$24\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 24,$$which yields the radius $r=\\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the diameter of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 11,$ $AC=6,$ and $BC=7$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $d$ be the diameter of the inscribed circle, and let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Let $s$ be the semiperimeter of the triangle, that is, $s=\\frac{AB+AC+BC}{2}=12$. Let $K$ denote the area of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nHeron's formula tells us that \\begin{align*}\nK &= \\sqrt{s(s-AB)(s-AC)(s-BC)} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{12\\cdot 1\\cdot 6\\cdot 5} \\\\\n&= \\sqrt{6^2\\cdot 10} \\\\\n&= 6\\sqrt{10}.\n\\end{align*}The area of a triangle is equal to its semiperimeter multiplied by the radius of its inscribed circle ($K=rs$), so we have $$6\\sqrt{10} = r\\cdot 12,$$which yields the radius $r=\\frac {\\sqrt{10}}{2}$. This yields the diameter $d = \\boxed{\\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = AC=7$ and $BC=6$?

What is the distance between the centers of those circles?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the vertices of the triangle so that $AB = 5$, $AC = 12$, and $BC = 13$.  Let $I$ and $O$ be the incenter and circumcenter of triangle $ABC$, respectively.  Let the incircle of triangle $ABC$ be tangent to sides $BC$, $AC$, and $AB$ at $D$, $E$, and $F$, respectively.\n\n[asy]\nimport geometry;\n\nunitsize(0.4 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, I, O;\n\nA = (5^2/13,5*12/13);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (13,0);\nI = incenter(A,B,C);\nD = (I + reflect(B,C)*(I))/2;\nE = (I + reflect(C,A)*(I))/2;\nF = (I + reflect(A,B)*(I))/2;\nO = (B + C)/2;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(incircle(A,B,C));\ndraw(I--D);\ndraw(I--E);\ndraw(I--F);\ndraw(I--O);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, N);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\ndot(\"$D$\", D, S);\ndot(\"$E$\", E, NE);\ndot(\"$F$\", F, NW);\ndot(\"$I$\", I, N);\ndot(\"$O$\", O, S);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle BAC = 90^\\circ$, the circumcenter $O$ of triangle $ABC$ is the midpoint of hypotenuse $BC$.\n\nSince $AE$ and $AF$ are tangents from $A$ to the same circle, $AE = AF$.  Let $x = AE = AF$.  Similarly, let $y = BD = BF$ and $z = CD = CE$.  Then $x + y = AF + BF = AB = 5$, $x + z = AE + CE = AC = 12$, $y + z = BD + CD = BC = 13$.  Solving this system of equations, we find $x = 2$, $y = 3$, and $z = 10$.  Then $DO = BO - BD = BC/2 - y = 13/2 - 3 = 7/2$.\n\nThe inradius $r$ of triangle $ABC$ is given by $r = K/s$, where $K$ is the area of triangle $ABC$, and $s$ is the semi-perimeter.  We see that $K = [ABC] = 1/2 \\cdot AB \\cdot AC = 1/2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 12 = 30$, and $s = (AB + AC + BC)/2 = (5 + 12 + 13)/2 = 15$, so $r = 30/15 = 2$.\n\nHence, by the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle $IDO$, \\[IO = \\sqrt{ID^2 + DO^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + \\left( \\frac{7}{2} \\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{65}{4}} = \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{2}}.\\]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 9$, $BC = 12$, $AC = 15$, and $CD$ is the angle bisector.  Find the length of $CD$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n $\\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle, since $9^2 + 12^2 = 15^2$. Thus, $\\angle ABC = 90^\\circ$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D;\n\nA = (0,9);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (12,0);\nD = (0,4);\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(C--D);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, W);\n[/asy]\n\nBy the angle bisector theorem, $BD/AD = BC/AC$, so \\[BD = \\frac{BC}{BC + AC} \\cdot AB = \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot 9 = 4.\\] Then by use of the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $BCD$, $CD = \\sqrt{BC^2 + BD^2} = \\sqrt{12^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{160} = \\boxed{4 \\sqrt{10}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Let $\\triangle ABC$ have side lengths $AB=13$, $AC=14$, and $BC=15$.  There are two circles located inside $\\angle BAC$ which are tangent to rays $\\overline{AB}$, $\\overline{AC}$, and segment $\\overline{BC}$.  Compute the distance between the centers of these two circles.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The two circles described in the problem are shown in the diagram.  The circle located inside $\\triangle ABC$ is called the incircle; following convention we will label its center $I$.  The other circle is known as an excircle, and we label its center $E$.  To begin, we may compute the area of triangle $ABC$ using Heron's formula.  The side lengths of triangle $\\triangle ABC$ are $a=15$, $b=14$, and $c=13$, while the semiperimeter is $s=\\frac{1}{2}(a+b+c)=21$, so its area is \\[ K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{21\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdot 8} = 84. \\]We find the inradius $r$ of $\\triangle ABC$ by using the fact that $K=rs$, so $84=21r$, giving $r=4$.  Next label the points of tangency of the incircle and excircle with ray $\\overline{AC}$ as $S$ and $T$, as shown at right.  It is a standard fact that $AS=s-a=6$ and $AT=s=21$. (The reader should confirm this.  Repeatedly use the fact that tangents from a point to a circle have the same length.)  Furthermore, the angle bisector of $\\angle A$ passes through $I$ and $E$, and the radii $\\overline{SI}$ and $\\overline{TE}$ are perpendicular to $\\overline{AC}$, so triangles $\\triangle ASI$ and $\\triangle ATE$ are similar right triangles.  By the Pythagorean Theorem we compute \\[ AI = \\sqrt{(AS)^2+(SI)^2} = \\sqrt{36+16}=2\\sqrt{13}. \\]Using the similar triangles we find that $AI/AE = AS/AT = 6/21 = 2/7$.  Therefore $AE=7\\sqrt{13}$ and we conclude that $IE=AE-AI=\\boxed{5\\sqrt{13}}$.\n\n[asy]\nimport olympiad; size(150); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8)); dotfactor=4;\ndraw((0,0)--(4,0)--(3,5)--cycle);\ndraw(incircle((0,0),(4,0),(3,5)));\nreal x = 1.15;\npair A = (0,0) + x*(-3,-5);\npair B = (4,0) + x*(1,-5);\ndraw(A--(3,5)--B--cycle);\ndraw(incircle(A,(3,5),B));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(3,5),N);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(4,0),E);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(0,0),W);\npair I = incenter((0,0),(3,5),(4,0));\npair iFoot = foot(I,(0,0),(3,5));\nlabel(\"$S$\",iFoot,W);\nlabel(\"$I$\",I,E);\ndraw(iFoot--I);\npair I2 = incenter(A,(3,5),B);\npair iFoot2 = foot(I2,(0,0),(3,5));\nlabel(\"$T$\",iFoot2,W);\nlabel(\"$E$\",I2,S);\ndraw(iFoot2--I2);\ndraw((3,5)--(I2));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with legs $AB$ and $AC$. Points $X$ and $Y$ lie on legs $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, so that $AX:XB = AY:YC = 1:2$. If $BY = 16$ units, and $CX = 28$ units, what is the length of hypotenuse $BC$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let $AB = x$ and $AC = y$. Then we can write two Pythagorean equations from the information given: $(x/3)^2 + y^2 = 28^2$ and $x^2 + (y/3)^2 = 16^2$. These equations become $x^2/9 + y^2 = 784$ and $x^2 + y^2/9 = 256$. Multiplying them both by 9, we get $x^2 + 9y^2= 7056$ and $9x^2 + y^2\n= 2304$. Now we add the two equations to get $10x^2 + 10y^2 = 9360$, which can be reduced to $x^2\n+ y^2 = 936$. We do not need to solve for $x$ and $y$ since 936 is the square of the hypotenuse $BC$. The length is thus $\\sqrt{936} = \\sqrt{(36 \\times 26)} = \\sqrt{36} \\times \\sqrt{26} = \\boxed{6\\sqrt{26}}$ units.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 7$, $AC = 15$, and the length of median $AM$ is 10.  Find the area of triangle $ABC$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Extend $AM$ to $D$ so that $MD = MA$.  Then triangles $AMB$ and $DMC$ are congruent, so triangles $ABC$ and $ACD$ have equal area.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.3 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, M;\n\nA = (-7/sqrt(37),42/sqrt(37));\nB = (0,0);\nC = (2*sqrt(37),0);\nM = (B + C)/2;\nD = 2*M - A;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--D--C);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, NE);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, S);\nlabel(\"$M$\", M, SW);\n\nlabel(\"$7$\", (A + B)/2, W);\nlabel(\"$15$\", (A + C)/2, NE);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (A + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$10$\", (D + M)/2, SW);\nlabel(\"$7$\", (C + D)/2, E);\n[/asy]\n\nThe semi-perimeter of triangle $ACD$ is $(7 + 15 + 20)/2 = 21$, so by Heron's formula, the area of triangle $ACD$ is $$\\sqrt{21 (21 - 7)(21 - 15)(21 - 20)} = \\boxed{42}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 16$, $AC = 24$, $BC = 19$, and $AD$ is an angle bisector.

By the angle bisector theorem, $BD/CD = AB/AC = 16/24 = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the radius of the circle inscribed in triangle $ABC$ if $AB = 12, AC=14, BC=16$?
