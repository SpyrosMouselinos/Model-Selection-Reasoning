    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two sides of a triangle measure 4 cm and 9 cm. What is the greatest integer number of centimeters that could be the third side of this triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Using the Triangle Inequality, we see that the third side must be smaller than the sum of the first two sides, or 13 cm. That means the greatest integer number of centimeters for the third side is $\\boxed{12}.$\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The areas of three of the faces of a right, rectangular prism are $24 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2$, $32 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2$, and $48 \\hspace{.6mm} \\mathrm{cm}^2$. What is the volume of the prism, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let the three dimensions of the prism (length, width, and height, although not necessarily in that order) be $x,y,z$ such that $xy = 24$, $xz = 32$, and $yz = 48$.  Then the volume of the prism is $xyz$.  Multiplying our three equations together and taking the square root of both sides, we find that $xyz = \\sqrt{24\\cdot 32\\cdot 48} = \\boxed{192}$ cubic centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A cube has a surface area of 216 square centimeters. What is the volume of the cube, in cubic centimeters?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n There are 6 faces to a cube, meaning that each face has area 36, and the edge has length 6, for a total volume of $6^3 = \\boxed{216}$ for the cube.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n When a right triangle is rotated about one leg, the volume of the cone produced is $800\\pi \\;\\textrm{ cm}^3$. When the triangle is rotated about the other leg, the volume of the cone produced is $1920\\pi \\;\\textrm{ cm}^3$. What is the length (in cm) of the hypotenuse of the triangle?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Let one leg of the triangle have length $a$ and let the other leg have length $b$. When we rotate around the leg of length $a$, the result is a cone of height $a$ and radius $b$, and so of volume $\\frac 13 \\pi ab^2 = 800\\pi$. Likewise, when we rotate around the leg of length $b$ we get a cone of height $b$ and radius $a$ and so of volume $\\frac13 \\pi b a^2 = 1920 \\pi$. If we divide this equation by the previous one, we get $\\frac ab = \\frac{\\frac13 \\pi b a^2}{\\frac 13 \\pi ab^2} = \\frac{1920}{800} = \\frac{12}{5}$, so $a = \\frac{12}{5}b$. Then $\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\left(\\frac{12}{5}b\\right)b^2 = 800\\pi$ so $b^3 = 1000$ and $b = 10$ so $a = 24$. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem, the hypotenuse has length $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \\boxed{26}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Find the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cylinder formed by rotating a square with side length 14 centimeters about its vertical line of symmetry. Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n [asy]\nsize(100);\ndraw((-5,-.2)--(-3,-.2)--(-3,1.8)--(-5,1.8)--cycle); label(\"14\",((-3,1.8)--(-5,1.8)),N); label(\"14\",((-5,-.2)--(-5,1.8)),W);\ndraw((-2.5,.9)--(-1.5,.9),EndArrow);\nimport solids; import three; currentprojection = orthographic(5,0,2);\nrevolution c = cylinder((0,0,0), 1, 2);\ndraw((0,-1,2)--(0,1,2)); label(\"14\",((0,-1,2)--(0,1,2)),N); label(\"14\",(0,1,1),E);\ndraw(c,black);\n[/asy]\n\nRotating the square about its vertical line of symmetry creates a right circular cylinder with diameter 14 and height 14.  Thus, the cylinder has radius $14/2=7$ and volume $\\pi(7^2)(14)=\\pi(50-1)(14)=\\pi(700-14)=\\boxed{686\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The slant height of a cone is 13 cm, and the height from the vertex to the center of the base is 12 cm. What is the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cone? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We create a right triangle with the slant height as the hypotenuse, the height from the vertex to the center of the base as one of the legs, and a radius as the other leg.  By Pythagorean theorem, the radius measures $\\sqrt{13^2-12^2}=5$ cm.  It follows that the volume of the cone is $(1/3)\\pi(5^2)(12)=\\boxed{100\\pi}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The volume of a cylinder is $54\\pi$ $\\text{cm}^3$. How many cubic centimeters are in the volume of a cone with the same radius and height as the cylinder? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$. [asy]\nimport solids; currentprojection=orthographic(0,100,25); defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));\nrevolution cyl = cylinder((5,0,0),1,5,Z);\nrevolution cone = cone((0,0,0),1,5,Z);\ndraw(cyl,backpen=dashed);\ndraw(cone,backpen=dashed);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n A cone with radius $r$ and height $h$ has volume $(1/3)\\pi r^2 h$; a cylinder with the same radius and height has volume $\\pi r^2 h$.  Thus we see the volume of the corresponding cone has 1/3 the volume of the cylinder, which is $(1/3)(54\\pi = \\boxed{18\\pi}$ cubic cm.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The sum of the lengths of all the edges of a cube is 60 cm. Find the number of cubic centimeters in the volume of the cube.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since there are 12 congruent edges on a cube, each edge has length $60/12=5$ cm. Since the volume of the cube is equal to the edge length cubed, the volume is $5^3=5\\cdot5\\cdot5=\\boxed{125}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A circular sheet of paper with radius of $6$ cm is cut into three congruent sectors. What is the height of the cone in centimeters that can be created by rolling one of the sections until the edges meet? Express your answer in simplest radical form.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The circumference of the whole circle is $2 \\pi \\cdot 6 = 12 \\pi$, so the circumference of the base of the cone is $12 \\pi/3 = 4 \\pi$.  Hence, the radius of the base of the cone is $4 \\pi/(2 \\pi) = 2$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(2 cm);\n\nfill((0,0)--arc((0,0),1,-60,60)--cycle,gray(0.7));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),1));\ndraw((0,0)--dir(60));\ndraw((0,0)--dir(180));\ndraw((0,0)--dir(300));\nlabel(\"$6$\", dir(60)/2, NW);\n[/asy]\n\nThe slant height of the cone is 6 (the radius of the original circle), so by Pythagoras, the height of the cone is $\\sqrt{6^2 - 2^2} = \\sqrt{32} = \\boxed{4 \\sqrt{2}}$.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.8 cm);\n\ndraw((-2,0)--(2,0)--(0,4*sqrt(2))--cycle);\ndraw((0,0)--(0,4*sqrt(2)));\n\nlabel(\"$2$\", (1,0), S);\nlabel(\"$6$\", (1,2*sqrt(2)), NE);\nlabel(\"$4 \\sqrt{2}$\", (0,0.7*2*sqrt(2)), W);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In tetrahedron $ABCD$, edge $AB$ has length 3 cm. The area of face $ABC$ is $15\\mbox{cm}^2$ and the area of face $ABD$ is $12 \\mbox { cm}^2$. These two faces meet each other at a $30^\\circ$ angle. Find the volume of the tetrahedron in $\\mbox{cm}^3$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n It is clear that $DX=8$ and $CX=10$ where $X$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ and $C$ to side $AB$. Thus $[DXC]=\\frac{ab\\sin{c}}{2}=20=5 \\cdot h \\rightarrow h = 4$ where h is the height of the tetrahedron from $D$. Hence, the volume of the tetrahedron is $\\frac{bh}{3}=15\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}=\\boxed{20}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Right $\\triangle ABC$ with legs $AB=3$ cm and $CB=4$ cm is rotated about one of its legs.
