    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $P$ and $R$ are located at (2, 1) and (12, 15) respectively. Point $M$ is the midpoint of segment $\\overline{PR}$. Segment $\\overline{PR}$ is reflected over the $x$-axis. What is the sum of the coordinates of the image of point $M$ (the midpoint of the reflected segment)?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Point $M$ has coordinates $(7,8)$. Therefore, its image has coordinates $(7,-8)$. Thus the sum is $7-8 = \\boxed{-1}$.\n\nAlternatively, the image of point $M$ is the midpoint of the images of points $P$ and $R$ and thus is the midpoint of $(2,-1)$ and $(12,-15)$, which is also $(7,-8)$.\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The image of the point with coordinates $(1,1)$ under the reflection across the line $y=mx+b$ is the point with coordinates $(9,5)$.  Find $m+b$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection.  The slope of the segment is $\\frac{5-1}{9-1}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Since the line of reflection is perpendicular, its slope, $m$, equals $-2$.  By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment are $\\left(\\frac{9+1}2,\\frac{5+1}2\\right)=(5,3)$.   Since the line of reflection goes through this point, we have $3=(-2)(5)+b$, and so $b=13$.  Thus $m+b=-2+13=\\boxed{11}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Point $A$ has coordinates $(x,6)$. When Point $A$ is reflected over the $y$-axis it lands on Point $B$. What is the sum of the four coordinate values of points $A$ and $B$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The coordinates of point $B$ are $(-x,6)$.  The sum of all four coordinates is $x+6+(-x)+6=\\boxed{12}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The image of the point with coordinates $(-3,-1)$ under the reflection across the line $y=mx+b$ is the point with coordinates $(5,3)$.  Find $m+b$.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The line of reflection is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting the point with its image under the reflection.  The slope of the segment is $\\frac{3-(-1)}{5-(-3)}=\\frac{1}{2}$.  Since the line of reflection is perpendicular, its slope, $m$, equals $-2$.  By the midpoint formula, the coordinates of the midpoint of the segment is $\\left(\\frac{5-3}2,\\frac{3-1}2\\right)=(1,1)$.   Since the line of reflection goes through this point, we have $1=(-2)(1)+b$, and so $b=3$.  Thus $m+b=\\boxed{1}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Triangle $ABC$ has vertices with coordinates $A(2,3),$ $B(7,8),$ and $C(-4,6)$. The triangle is reflected about line $L$. The image points are $A'(2,-5),$ $B'(7,-10),$ and $C'(-4,-8)$. What is the equation of line $L$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since only the $y$ portions of the coordinates move, we know that the line of reflection must be a horizontal line. Now we just need to find the midpoint between an original point and its reflected image to pinpoint the location of the line. The $y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 3 and the $y$-coordinate of $A'$ is $-5$; therefore, the midpoint is at $(2, -1)$. The line of refection is $\\boxed{y = -1}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The center of a circle has coordinates $(6,-5)$. The circle is reflected about the line $y=x$. What are the $x,y$ coordinates of the center of the image circle? State the $x$ coordinate first.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The center of the image circle is simply the center of the original circle reflected over the line $y=x$. When reflecting over this line, we swap the $x$ and $y$ coordinates. Thus, the image center is the point $\\boxed{(-5, 6)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In triangle $ABC$, $AB = 3$, $AC = 5$, and $BC = 4$.  The medians $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ of triangle $ABC$ intersect at the centroid $G$.  Let the projections of $G$ onto $BC$, $AC$, and $AB$ be $P$, $Q$, and $R$, respectively.  Find $GP + GQ + GR$.\n\n[asy]\nimport geometry;\n\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, G, P, Q, R;\n\nA = (0,3);\nB = (0,0);\nC = (4,0);\nD = (B + C)/2;\nE = (C + A)/2;\nF = (A + B)/2;\nG = (A + B + C)/3;\nP = (G + reflect(B,C)*(G))/2;\nQ = (G + reflect(C,A)*(G))/2;\nR = (G + reflect(A,B)*(G))/2;\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(A--G);\ndraw(B--G);\ndraw(C--G);\ndraw(G--P);\ndraw(G--Q);\ndraw(G--R);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, dir(90));\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, SW);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, SE);\nlabel(\"$G$\", G, SE);\nlabel(\"$P$\", P, S);\nlabel(\"$Q$\", Q, NE);\nlabel(\"$R$\", R, W);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n By Pythagoras, triangle $ABC$ is right with $\\angle B = 90^\\circ$.  Then the area of triangle $ABC$ is $1/2 \\cdot AB \\cdot BC = 1/2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 6$.\n\nSince $G$ is the centroid of triangle $ABC$, the areas of triangles $BCG$, $CAG$, and $ABG$ are all one-third the area of triangle $ABC$, namely $6/3 = 2$.\n\nWe can view $PG$ as the height of triangle $BCG$ with respect to base $BC$.  Then \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot GP \\cdot BC = 2,\\]so $GP = 4/BC = 4/4 = 1$.  Similarly, $GQ = 4/AC = 4/5$ and $GR = 4/AB = 4/3$.  Therefore, $GP + GQ + GR = 1 + 4/5 + 4/3 = \\boxed{\\frac{47}{15}}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Segment $s_1$ has endpoints at $(4,1)$ and $(-8,5)$.  Segment $s_2$ is obtained by translating $s_1$ by $2$ units to the right and $3$ units up. Find the midpoint of segment $s_2$.  Express your answer as $(a,b)$ with $a$ and $b$ integers.\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The midpoint of segment $s_1$ can be found using the midpoint formula: $\\left(\\frac{4-8}2,\\frac{1+5}2\\right)=(-2,3).$  The midpoint of $s_2$ is the translation of the midpoint of $s_1$ be $2$ units to the right and $3$ units up.  Thus its coordinates are $(-2+2,3+3)=\\boxed{(0,6)}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The point $A$ $(3,4)$ is reflected over the $x$-axis to $B$. Then $B$ is reflected over the line $y=x$ to $C$. What is the area of triangle $ABC$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n When point $A$ is reflected over the $x$-axis, we get point B, which is $(3,-4)$. Reflecting point $B$ over the line $y=x$, we get that point $C$ is $(-4,3)$. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is 8. The distance from point $C$ to the line connecting $A$ and $B$ is 7. Now we can draw the following diagram: [asy]\ndraw((0,8)--(0,-8),Arrows);\ndraw((8,0)--(-8,0),Arrows);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,8),N);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(8,0),E);\ndot((3,4));\nlabel(\"$A$\",(3,4),NE);\ndot((3,-4));\nlabel(\"$B$\",(3,-4),SE);\ndot((-4,3));\nlabel(\"$C$\",(-4,3),W);\ndraw((3,4)--(3,-4)--(-4,3)--cycle);\ndraw((-4,3)--(3,3),linetype(\"8 8\"));\n[/asy] We find that the triangle has a height of length 7 and a base of length 8. Therefore, the area of triangle $ABC$ is equal to  $$\\frac{1}{2}bh=\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot7\\cdot8=\\boxed{28}.$$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $T$ has its center at point $T(-2,6)$. Circle $T$ is reflected across the $y$-axis and then translated 8 units down. What are the coordinates of the image of the center of circle $T$?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Since the image is reflected across the $y$-axis first, we will just change the sign of the $x$-coordinate, which will give us $(2, 6)$. Next the image is shifted down 8 units so we will subtract 8 from the $y$-coordinate, giving our image a final center of $\\boxed{(2, -2)}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Points $P$ and $R$ are located at (1, 3) and (7, 15) respectively. Point $M$ is the midpoint of segment $PR$. Segment $PR$ is reflected over the $x$-axis. What is the sum of the coordinates of the image of point $M$ (the midpoint of the reflected segment)?\n\nAnswer:\n",
