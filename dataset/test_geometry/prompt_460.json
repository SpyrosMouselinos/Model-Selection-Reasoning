    "prompt": "You are a helpful assistant that can identify the correct answer to the math problem.\n\nLet's solve the following math problems. You need to solve these math problems step by step. Here is one example how to do it:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Six small circles, each of radius $3$ units, are tangent to a large circle as shown. Each small circle also is tangent to its two neighboring small circles. What is the diameter of the large circle in units? [asy]\ndraw(Circle((-2,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((2,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((-1,1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((1,1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((-1,-1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((1,-1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),3));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can draw two similar hexagons, an outer one for which the large circle is the circumcircle and an inner one that connects the centers of the smaller circles. We know that the sidelength of the inner hexagon is 6 since $\\overline{DE}$ consists of the radii of two small circles. We also know that the radius of the outer hexagon is 3 units longer than the radius of the inner hexagon since $\\overline{AD}$ is the radius of a small circle. There are now several approaches to solving the problem.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 1:}$ We use a 30-60-90 triangle to find the radius $\\overline{CD}$ of the inner hexagon. Triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle since $\\overline{CE}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are both radii of a regular hexagon. So dropping a perpendicular from $C$ to $\\overline{DE}$ bisects $\\angle C$ and $\\overline{DE}$ and creates two congruent right triangles. The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{6}=60^\\circ$. So $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$. Each right triangle has a leg of length $\\frac{DE}{2}=3$ and is a 30-60-90 right triangle (since $\\angle C$ was bisected into two angles of $30^\\circ$). That makes the length of the hypotenuse (the radius of the inner hexagon) two times the length of the short leg, or $2\\cdot3=6$. Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\\boxed{18}$ units long.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 2:}$ We prove that the triangles formed by the center to two vertices of a regular hexagon (such as $\\triangle CED$ and $\\triangle CBA$) are equilateral triangles. The central angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{360^\\circ}{60}=60^\\circ$. So $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$. The interior angle of a hexagon has a measure of $\\frac{180^\\circ (6-2)}{6}=\\frac{180^\\circ \\cdot4}{6}=30^\\circ \\cdot4=120^\\circ$. That means the other two angles in the triangle each have a measure of half the interior angle, or $60^\\circ$. All three angles equal $60^\\circ$ so the triangle is an equilateral triangle. Then we know that $CD=DE=6$. Now we know that the radius of the outer hexagon is $6+3=9$, so the diameter is $\\boxed{18}$ units long.\n\n$\\emph{Approach 3:}$ Another way to prove that the triangles are equilateral is to show that triangle $CED$ is an isosceles triangle and $m\\angle C=60^\\circ$ (see other approaches for how). That means $m\\angle D=m\\angle E$ and $m\\angle D+ m\\angle E=120^\\circ$. Then all three angles have a measure of $60^\\circ$ each. We continue the rest of approach 2 after proving that triangle $CED$ is equilateral.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(1 cm);\n\ndraw(Circle((-2,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((2,0),1));\ndraw(Circle((-1,1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((1,1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((-1,-1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((1,-1.73205081),1));\ndraw(Circle((0,0),3));\npair A=(3,0), B=(1.5, 2.598), C=(0,0), D=(-1.5, 2.598), E=(-3,0), F=(-1.5, -2.598), G=(1.5, -2.598);\npair H=(2,0), I=(1, 1.732), J=(-1, 1.732), K=(-2,0), L=(-1, -1.732), M=(1, -1.732);\npath f1=A--B--D--E--F--G--cycle;\npath f2=H--I--J--K--L--M--cycle;\ndraw(f2);\ndraw(f1);\ndraw(B--C);\ndraw(A--C);\ndraw(C--(H+I)/2);\npen sm=fontsize(10);\nlabel(\"A\", A, NE, sm); label(\"B\", B, NE, sm); label(\"C\",C,W, sm);\nlabel(\"D\", H, NE, sm); label(\"E\", I, NE, sm);\nlabel(\"$6$\", (H+I)/2, NE, sm);\nlabel(\"$3$\", (A+H)/2, S, sm);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nNow it's your turn. Here is another math problem:\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n What is the number of degrees in the smaller angle formed by the hour and minute hands of a clock at 8:15? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth.\n[asy]\nsize(200);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),5),linewidth(1.2));\npair[] mins;\nfor(int i = 0; i < 60; ++i){\n\nmins[i] = 4.5*dir(-6*i + 90);\n\ndot(mins[i]);\n}\nfor(int i = 1; i <= 12; ++i){\n\nlabel((string)i,mins[5*i % 60],dir(-30*i - 90));\n}\n\nfill(Circle((0,0),0.25));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n At 8:00, the hour hand is in the 8 o'clock position and the minute hand is in the 12 o'clock position.  The angle between the two hands is two-thirds of a full revolution, which is $\\frac{2}{3}(360^\\circ)=240$ degrees.  Every minute, the minute hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}(360^\\circ)=6$ degrees and the hour hand goes $\\frac{1}{60}\\cdot\\frac{1}{12} (360^\\circ)=0.5$ degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the hands decreases at a rate of 5.5 degrees per minute.  After 15 minutes, the angle between the hands has decreased to $240^\\circ-5.5^\\circ\\cdot 15=\\boxed{157.5}$ degrees.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n A machine-shop cutting tool has the shape of a notched circle, as shown. The radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{50}$ cm, the length of $AB$ is $6$ cm and that of $BC$ is $2$ cm. The angle $ABC$ is a right angle. Find the square of the distance (in centimeters) from $B$ to the center of the circle.\n[asy] size(150);  defaultpen(linewidth(0.6)+fontsize(11)); real r=10; pair O=(0,0), A=r*dir(45),B=(A.x,A.y-r),C; path P=circle(O,r); C=intersectionpoint(B--(B.x+r,B.y),P); draw(P); draw(C--B--A--B); dot(A); dot(B); dot(C); label(\"$A$\",A,NE); label(\"$B$\",B,S); label(\"$C$\",C,SE); [/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We use coordinates. Let the circle have center $(0,0)$ and radius $\\sqrt{50}$; this circle has equation $x^2 + y^2 = 50$. Let the coordinates of $B$ be $(a,b)$. We want to find $a^2 + b^2$. $A$ and $C$ with coordinates $(a,b+6)$ and $(a+2,b)$, respectively, both lie on the circle. From this we obtain the system of equations\n$a^2 + (b+6)^2 = 50$\n$(a+2)^2 + b^2 = 50$\nSolving, we get $a=5$ and $b=-1$, so the distance is $a^2 + b^2 = \\boxed{26}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Semicircles of diameter 2'' are lined up as shown. What is the area, in square inches, of the shaded region in a 1-foot length of this pattern? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]import graph;\nsize(101);\n\npath tophalf = Arc((0,0),1,180,0) -- Arc((2,0),1,180,0) -- Arc((4,0),1,180,0) -- Arc((6,0),1,180,0) -- Arc((8,0),1,180,90);\npath bottomhalf = Arc((7,0),1,360,180) -- Arc((5,0),1,360,180) -- Arc((3,0),1,360,180) -- Arc((1,0),1,360,180) -- Arc((-1,0),1,360,270);\nfill(tophalf--bottomhalf--cycle,gray(.6));\ndraw(tophalf,linewidth(1.5)); draw(bottomhalf,linewidth(1));\ndraw(\"$1'$\",(-3,1.5)--(10,1.5),N,linewidth(1.5),Arrows(4));\ndraw((-3,1.25)--(-3,1.75),linewidth(1.5)); draw((10,1.25)--(10,1.75),linewidth(1.5));\ndot((-5/3,0),linewidth(3)); dot((-7/3,0),linewidth(3)); dot((-3,0),linewidth(3));\ndot((26/3,0),linewidth(3)); dot((28/3,0),linewidth(3)); dot((10,0),linewidth(3));[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n 12 inches of the pattern contains one semicircle on top and on bottom for each diameter, or $\\frac{12}{2}\\cdot2=12$ total semicircles. This is the equivalent of 6 full circles, so the shaded area is $6\\cdot1^2\\pi=\\boxed{6\\pi}$ square inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Circle $T$ has a circumference of $12\\pi$ inches, and segment $XY$ is a diameter. If the measure of angle $TXZ$ is $60^{\\circ}$, what is the length, in inches, of segment $XZ$?\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),13),linewidth(1));\ndraw((-12,-5)--(-5,-12)--(12,5)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndot((0,0));\n\nlabel(\"T\",(0,0),N);\nlabel(\"X\",(-12,-5),W);\nlabel(\"Z\",(-5,-12),S);\nlabel(\"Y\",(12,5),E);\n\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n We can begin by using the circumference to solve for the radius of the circle.  If the circumference is $12\\pi$, then $2\\pi r=12\\pi$ which implies $r=6$.  Now, we can draw in the radius $TZ$ as shown: [asy]\nsize(150);\ndraw(Circle((0,0),13),linewidth(1));\ndraw((-12,-5)--(-5,-12)--(12,5)--cycle,linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(-5,-12),linewidth(1)+linetype(\"0 4\"));\ndot((0,0));\n\nlabel(\"T\",(0,0),N);\nlabel(\"X\",(-12,-5),W);\nlabel(\"Z\",(-5,-12),S);\nlabel(\"Y\",(12,5),E);\n\n[/asy]\n\nWe know that $TX=TZ$, since both are radii of length 6.  We are given $\\angle TXZ=60^{\\circ}$, so $\\angle TZX=60^{\\circ}$, and triangle $TXZ$ is equilateral.  Thus, $TX=TZ=XZ=\\boxed{6}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The second hand on the clock pictured below is 6 cm long.  How far in centimeters does the tip of this second hand travel during a period of 30 minutes? Express your answer in terms of $\\pi$.\n\n[asy]\ndraw(Circle((0,0),20));\nlabel(\"12\",(0,20),S);\nlabel(\"9\",(-20,0),E);\nlabel(\"6\",(0,-20),N);\nlabel(\"3\",(20,0),W);\ndot((0,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(12,0));\ndraw((0,0)--(-8,10));\ndraw((0,0)--(-11,-14),linewidth(1));\nlabel(\"6cm\",(-5.5,-7),SE);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n In 30 minutes, the tip of the second hand travels 30 times around the circumference of a circle of radius 6cm. Since the circumference is $2\\pi \\cdot6 = 12\\pi$, the tip of the second hand travels $12\\pi \\cdot 30 = \\boxed{360\\pi}$ centimeters.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n The same amount of steel used to create eight solid steel balls, each with a radius of 1 inch, is used to create one larger steel ball. What is the radius of the larger ball?\n\n[asy]\nsize(150);\nfilldraw(circle((0,0),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((.9,-.8),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((1.8,.9),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((2,0),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((2,-.4),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((3,-.4),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((4.8,-.4),1),gray);\nfilldraw(circle((3.2,.5),1),gray);\n\ndraw((6,.7)--(8,.7),Arrow);\n\nfilldraw(circle((11,.2),2),gray);\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n The amount of steel used to create one ball with radius 1 is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi(1^3)=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$; the amount of steel used to create eight of these balls is $8\\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi = \\frac{32}{3}\\pi$.\n\nLet the radius of the large steel be $r$.  We have $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{32}{3}\\pi$; solving for $r$ yields $r^3 = 8 \\Rightarrow r = 2$.  Thus the radius of the large ball is $\\boxed{2}$ inches.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two sectors of a circle of radius $12$ are placed side by side, as shown. Determine the $\\textit{area}$ of figure $ABCD.$ [asy]\ndraw((0,0)--(12,0)..(10.3923,6)..(6,10.3923)--(-6,10.3923)..(-4.3923,4.3923)..(0,0),black+linewidth(1));\ndraw((0,0)--(6,10.3923),black+linewidth(1)+dashed);\nlabel(\"$A$\",(-6,10.3923),NW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",(6,10.3923),NE);\nlabel(\"$C$\",(12,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",(0,0),SW);\nlabel(\"$60^\\circ$\",(2,1));\nlabel(\"$60^\\circ$\",(4,9.3923));\n[/asy]\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Each of sector $ABD$ and $BDC$ is one-sixth of a full circle of radius $12,$ so each has area one-sixth of the area of a circle of radius $12.$ Therefore, each sector has area $$\\frac{1}{6}(\\pi(12^2))=\\frac{1}{6}(144\\pi)=24\\pi.$$ Thus, the area of figure $ABCD$ is $2( 24\\pi)=\\boxed{48\\pi}.$\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n In a circle with center $O$, $AD$ is a diameter, $ABC$ is a chord, $BO = 5$, and $\\angle ABO = \\text{arc } CD = 60^\\circ$.

Since triangle $AOC$ is isosceles with $AO = CO$, $\\angle OCA = \\angle OAC = 30^\\circ$.\n\n[asy]\nimport graph;\n\nunitsize(2 cm);\npair O, A, B, C, D;\n\nO = (0,0);\nA = dir(30);\nC = dir(160);\nB = (2*C + A)/3;\nD = -A;\n\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\ndraw(C--A--D);\ndraw(B--O);\ndraw(C--O);\n\nlabel(\"$A$\", A, NE);\nlabel(\"$B$\", B, N);\nlabel(\"$C$\", C, W);\nlabel(\"$D$\", D, SW);\nlabel(\"$O$\", O, SE);\n[/asy]\n\nSince $\\angle ABO = 60^\\circ$, and this angle is external to triangle $BCO$, $\\angle BOC = \\angle ABO - \\angle BCO = 60^\\circ - 30^\\circ = 30^\\circ$.  Hence, triangle $BCO$ is isosceles, and $BC = BO = \\boxed{5}$.\nXXXXX\nMath problem:\n Two circles are drawn in a 12-inch by 14-inch rectangle. Each circle has a diameter of 6 inches. If the circles do not extend beyond the rectangular region, what is the greatest possible distance (in inches) between the centers of the two circles?\nXXXXX\nAnswer:\n Suppose we put the two circles in opposite corners of the rectangle so that the circles are tangent to the sides of the rectangle, and they are diagonally across from each other. Then the center of each circle is 3 inches in from each side of the rectangle that it touches. Now imagine a rectangle that has opposite corners at the centers of these circles. This smaller rectangle measures 8 inches by 6 inches. The diagonal of this rectangle is the greatest possible distance between the centers of the two circles. It helps if we recognize that these lengths are $3 \\times 2$ and $4 \\times 2$, which means we have a multiple of the 3-4-5 Pythagorean Triple. Thus, the length of the diagonal must be $5 \\times 2 = \\boxed{10\\text{ inches}}$. Indeed, $8^2 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100 = 10^2$.
