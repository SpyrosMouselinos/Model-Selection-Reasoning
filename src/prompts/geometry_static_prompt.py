Let's check if the following problem-answer pairs are correct. Think step by step. Here are examples how to do it.

Question: A delicious circular pie with a diameter of $12\\text{cm}$ is cut into three equal-sized sector-shaped pieces. Let $l$ be the number of centimeters in the length of the longest line segment that may be drawn in one of these pieces. What is $l^2$?

Proposed Answer:
To solve this problem, we need to first visualize the pie and the sector-shaped pieces created when it's cut into three equal parts. Each sector will have a central angle of \( \frac{360^\circ}{3} = 120^\circ \). The diameter of the pie is \( 12 \) cm, so its radius (r) is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) cm.
The longest line segment that can be drawn in one of these sector-shaped pieces will be the line segment that connects the tip of the sector (at the center of the pie) to a point on the curved edge of the sector. This line segment will be a radius of the pie, which is \( 6 \) cm.
Therefore, \( l = 6 \) cm.
To find \( l^2 \), we simply square \( l \). So, \( l^2 = 6^2 = 36 \).
The answer is \\boxed{36}.

Correct Answer:
We need to find the square of the length of the longest line segment that can be drawn in one of the sector-shaped pieces of a circular pie with a diameter of 12 cm. This line segment is the straight line from point A to B in the sector.
We draw one sector and label the center of the circle as O, the endpoints of the radius forming the sector as A and B, and the midpoint of the arc AB as C. The longest segment in the sector is AB.
By drawing the perpendicular bisector from O to AB, we divide the line segment AB into two equal parts at point M. This creates two right triangles, MOA and MOB.
The angle AOB is a third of a full circle (360°), so it's 120°. Since OM bisects AOB, each of angles MOA and MOB is 60°. Therefore, MOB (and MOA) is a 30-60-90 right triangle.
In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratios of the sides opposite these angles are 1:sqrt(3):2. Here, OB is the hypotenuse and equals half the diameter of the pie, which is 6 cm. Therefore, OM (opposite the 30° angle) is half of OB, so OM = 3 cm. MB (opposite the 60° angle) is √3 times OM, so MB = 3sqrt(3) cm.
Since AB is twice MB (as M is the midpoint), AB = 2 × MB = 2 × 3sqrt(3) = 6sqrt(3) cm.
Finally, we square this length to find \( l^2 \), which is \( (6\sqrt{3})^2 = 36 \times 3 = 108 \).
Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{108}.


Now it's your turn. Here is another problem:
Question: The points $A$, $B$ and $C$ lie on the surface of a sphere with center $O$ and radius $20$. It is given that $AB=13$, $BC=14$, $CA=15$, and that the distance from $O$ to $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{m\\sqrt{n}}k$, where $m$, $n$, and $k$ are positive integers, $m$ and $k$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+k$.
Proposed Answer:
To solve this problem, we need to find the distance from the center of the sphere (point O) to the plane of triangle ABC. This distance is the altitude of the tetrahedron OABC from O to the base ABC.
The volume \( V \) of a tetrahedron can be calculated using the formula:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height} \]
Here, the height is the distance from O to the plane of triangle ABC, which we'll call \( h \). The base is triangle ABC.
First, we find the area of triangle ABC using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter \( s \) is \(\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21\). So, the area \( A \) of triangle ABC is
\[ A = \sqrt{s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - CA)} = \sqrt{21 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6} \]
The volume of the tetrahedron can also be calculated using the radius of the sphere and the sides of the triangle. For a tetrahedron with a vertex at the center of a sphere and the opposite face being a triangle with sides \( a, b, \) and \( c \), the volume is given by
\[ V = \frac{1}{12} \sqrt{9a^2b^2c^2 - a^2(b^2 + c^2 - R^2)^2 - b^2(c^2 + a^2 - R^2)^2 - c^2(a^2 + b^2 - R^2)^2} \]
where \( R \) is the circumradius of the triangle, which can be found using the formula
\[ R = \frac{abc}{4K} \]
where \( K \) is the area of the triangle and \( a, b, c \) are the sides of the triangle.
Find h (the Height of the Tetrahedron):
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times A \times h \]
Solving for \( h \), we get
\[ h = \frac{3V}{A} \]
The distance from O to triangle ABC is \( h = \frac{m\sqrt{n}}{k} \). We will determine \( m, n, \) and \( k \) by substituting the values of \( A \) and \( V \) into the formula for \( h \) and simplifying.
Finally, we add \( m, n, \) and \( k \) to find the required sum.
The distance from the center of the sphere to the plane of triangle ABC, expressed as a fraction, is approximately \(\frac{3421329680689633}{140737488355328}\). To express this in the form \(\frac{m\sqrt{n}}{k}\), we need to simplify and identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), and \(k\).



Question:  Let $A_0=(0,0)$. Distinct points $A_1,A_2,\\dots$ lie on the $x$-axis, and distinct points $B_1,B_2,\\dots$ lie on the graph of $y=\\sqrt{x}$. For every positive integer $n,\\ A_{n-1}B_nA_n$ is an equilateral triangle. What is the least $n$ for which the length $A_0A_n\\geq100$?\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 13\\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 15\\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 17\\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 19\\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 21$
Proposed Answer:
To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric progression of the points \( A_0, A_1, A_2, \dots \) along the x-axis and how their distances relate to the formation of equilateral triangles with points on the curve \( y = \sqrt{x} \).
In an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \), the altitude \( h \) is given by \( h = \frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2} \). The altitude of each triangle \( A_{n-1}B_nA_n \) will intersect the x-axis at \( A_{n-1} \) and extend to \( B_n \) on the curve \( y = \sqrt{x} \).
Since \( B_n \) lies on \( y = \sqrt{x} \), the y-coordinate of \( B_n \) is \( \sqrt{x} \), where \( x \) is the x-coordinate of \( B_n \). The distance from \( A_{n-1} \) to \( B_n \) is the altitude of the triangle, which is \( \frac{s_n\sqrt{3}}{2} \), where \( s_n \) is the side length of the triangle \( A_{n-1}B_nA_n \).
The x-coordinate of \( B_n \) is also the x-coordinate of \( A_n \). Therefore, the distance between \( A_{n-1} \) and \( A_n \) along the x-axis is equal to the side length \( s_n \) of the equilateral triangle.
The side length \( s_n \) increases as \( n \) increases, since each subsequent point \( A_n \) is further away from \( A_0 \). The relationship between successive side lengths depends on the geometry of the equilateral triangles and the curve \( y = \sqrt{x} \).
We need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that the cumulative distance from \( A_0 \) to \( A_n \) is at least 100. This requires summing the side lengths of the equilateral triangles formed up to \( A_n \).
Given the geometric progression and the relationship between the triangles and the curve, we can now calculate this progression and determine the smallest \( n \) for which \( A_0A_n \geq 100 \). Let's compute it.
It seems there was an error in the calculation due to the complexity of the relationship between the side lengths of the equilateral triangles and the curve \( y = \sqrt{x} \). The error occurred while trying to relate the side length of the equilateral triangle to its altitude, which corresponds to the y-coordinate on the curve.
The problem requires a more nuanced approach, considering the incremental increase in the side lengths of the equilateral triangles and how these lengths are mapped onto the x-axis. This mapping is not straightforward due to the curve \( y = \sqrt{x} \) and the geometric properties of equilateral triangles.
To find the least \( n \) for which \( A_0A_n \geq 100 \), a detailed step-by-step calculation of each triangle's side length and its contribution to the total distance along the x-axis is necessary. This process involves iterative calculations and might be complex to execute directly in this format.



Question: The sides of a triangle have lengths $11, 15,$ and $k,$ where $k$ is a positive integer. For how many values of $k$ is the triangle obtuse?
Proposed Answer:
To determine the number of values of \( k \) for which the triangle with sides \( 11, 15, \) and \( k \) is obtuse, we need to consider the properties of obtuse triangles. A triangle is obtuse if one of its angles is greater than \( 90^\circ \). In such a triangle, the square of the longest side is greater than the sum of the squares of the other two sides. 
Let's break this down into cases, considering \( k \) as the longest side and then \( 15 \) as the longest side:
When \( k \) is the longest side:For the triangle to be obtuse with \( k \) as the longest side, the following inequality must be satisfied:
\[ k^2 > 11^2 + 15^2 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ k^2 > 121 + 225 \]
\[ k^2 > 346 \]
\[ k > \sqrt{346} \]
Since \( k \) is a positive integer, we consider integer values greater than \( \sqrt{346} \).
For the triangle to be obtuse with \( 15 \) as the longest side, the following inequality must be satisfied:
\[ 15^2 > 11^2 + k^2 \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ 225 > 121 + k^2 \]
\[ k^2 < 104 \]
\[ k < \sqrt{104} \]
Again, considering \( k \) as a positive integer, we need values less than \( \sqrt{104} \).
We also need to consider the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. This gives us two more inequalities:
\[ 11 + 15 > k \]
\[ 11 + k > 15 \]
\[ 15 + k > 11 \]
The third inequality is always true for positive \( k \). From the first two inequalities, we deduce that \( k < 26 \) and \( k > 4 \).
Combining all these conditions, we need to find the integer values of \( k \) that satisfy both the obtuse angle conditions and the triangle inequality theorem. Let's calculate the range of values for \( k \).
The values of \( k \) for which the triangle with sides \( 11, 15, \) and \( k \) is obtuse are \( 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, \) and \( 25 \). There are \( 12 \) such values of \( k \). 
Therefore, there are \( 12 \) values of \( k \) for which the triangle is obtuse. \\boxed{12}



Question: Amy and Belinda each roll a sheet of 6-inch by 8-inch paper to form a cylindrical tube. Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together without overlap. Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together without overlap. What is $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes?
Proposed Answer:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volumes of the two cylindrical tubes formed by Amy and Belinda and then find the positive difference between these volumes multiplied by \( \pi \).
Amy's Cylinder:
- Amy rolls the paper along the 8-inch sides, forming a cylinder with a height of 8 inches and a radius of half the 6-inch side (since the circumference of the base of the cylinder is the length of the paper).
- Radius \( r_A = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) inches.
- Height \( h_A = 8 \) inches.
- Volume \( V_A = \pi r_A^2 h_A = \pi \times 3^2 \times 8 \).

Belinda's Cylinder:
- Belinda rolls the paper along the 6-inch sides, forming a cylinder with a height of 6 inches and a radius of half the 8-inch side.
- Radius \( r_B = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) inches.
- Height \( h_B = 6 \) inches.
- Volume \( V_B = \pi r_B^2 h_B = \pi \times 4^2 \times 6 \).

The positive difference in volumes \( |V_B - V_A| \).
We need to calculate \( \pi \times |V_B - V_A| \).
The value of \( \pi \) times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes formed by Amy and Belinda is approximately \\boxed{236.87}.



Question:  In a 5 by 5 grid, each of the 25 small squares measures 2 cm by 2 cm and is shaded. Five unshaded circles are then placed on top of the grid as shown. The area of the visible shaded region can be written in the form $A-B\\pi$ square cm. What is the value $A+B$?\n\n[asy]\nfor(int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n\nfor(int j = 0; j < 5; ++j)\n\n{\n\nfilldraw((i,j)--(i+1,j)--(i+1,j+1)--(i,j+1)--(i,j)--cycle,gray,linewidth(2));\n\n}\n}\n\nfilldraw(circle((2.5,.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\nfilldraw(circle((4.5,2.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\nfilldraw(circle((2.5,4.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\nfilldraw(circle((.5,2.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\n\nfilldraw(circle((2.5,2.5),1.5),white,linewidth(2));\n[/asy]
Proposed Answer:
Total Area of the Grid:
- Each side of the grid measures \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) cm, so the total area of the grid is \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) square cm.

Area of the Four Smaller Circles:
- The diameter of each smaller circle is equal to the side of a small square, which is 2 cm. Thus, the radius of each smaller circle is 1 cm.
- The total area of the four smaller circles is \( 4 \times \pi \times 1^2 = 4\pi \) square cm.

Area of the Large Circle:
- The diameter of the large circle is equal to the length of three sides of a small square, which is 6 cm. Thus, the radius of the large circle is 3 cm.
- The area of the large circle is \( \pi \times 3^2 = 9\pi \) square cm.

Area of the Visible Shaded Region:
- The area of the visible shaded region is the area of the grid minus the area of the five circles.
- So, the area is \( 100 - 4\pi - 9\pi = 100 - 13\pi \) square cm.

Given that \( A = 100 \) and \( B = 13 \), the value of \( A+B \) is \( 100 + 13 = \boxed{113} \).

Correct Answer:
#There are mistakes in the proposed solution. Here is a valid one:
We use Heron's Formula. The semi-perimeter \( s \) is \(\frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21\). So, the area \( K \) of triangle ABC is
\[ K = \sqrt{s(s - 13)(s - 14)(s - 15)} = \sqrt{21 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6} = 84 \]
The circumradius \( R \) is given by \[ R = \frac{abc}{4K} = \frac{13 \times 14 \times 15}{4 \times 84} = \frac{65}{8} \]
We use the Pythagorean Theorem on the triangle formed by the radius of the sphere, the circumradius, and the perpendicular from O to the plane of ABC.
\[ OD = \sqrt{20^2 - R^2} = \sqrt{20^2 - \left(\frac{65}{8}\right)^2} = \sqrt{400 - \frac{4225}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{25600 - 4225}{64}} = \frac{\sqrt{21375}}{8} \]
Simplifying further, \( OD = \frac{15\sqrt{95}}{8} \).
The final answer is the sum of the numbers in the simplified form of the distance \( OD \), which is \( 15 + 95 + 8 \).
Therefore, the final answer is \( 15 + 95 + 8 = \boxed{118} \).



Correct Answer:
#There are mistakes in the proposed solution. Here is a valid one:
Given \( a_n = |A_{n-1}A_n| \), the recursion is given by:
\[ \left(a_n \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{a_n}{2} + a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + \cdots + a_1 \]
This is derived from the fact that the points \( B_n \) lie on the graph of \( y = \sqrt{x} \), and \( A_{n-1}B_nA_n \) forms an equilateral triangle.
By considering the recursion for \( n = k \) and \( n = k - 1 \), we get:
\[ \left(a_k \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(a_{k-1} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = a_k - a_{k-1} = \frac{2}{3} \]
This implies that each segment of a successive triangle is \( \frac{2}{3} \) more than the last triangle.
Plugging in \( k = 1 \) into the recursion gives \( a_1 - a_0 = \frac{2}{3} \). Since \( a_0 = 0 \), we find \( a_1 = \frac{2}{3} \).
Thus, \( a_n = \frac{2n}{3} \).
The total length \( A_0A_n \) is the sum of \( a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_1 \), which is:
\[ A_0A_n = a_n + a_{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{3} \]
We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n^2 < 300 < (n+1)^2 \). The solution is \( n = 17 \) since \( 17^2 = 289 < 300 \) and \( 18^2 = 324 > 300 \).
Therefore, the least \( n \) for which the length \( A_0A_n \geq 100 \) is \( \boxed{17} \).



Correct Answer:
#There are mistakes in the proposed solution. Here is a valid one:
Case 1 - Longest side length is 15:** For \( k \le 15 \),
- By the triangle inequality, we must have \( 15 < 11 + k \), which simplifies to \( k > 4 \).
- For the triangle to be obtuse, \( 15^2 > 11^2 + k^2 \), simplifying to \( 104 > k^2 \). Since \( k \) is an integer, \( k \le 10 \).
Combining these, the valid values of \( k \) in this case are \( 5, 6, \ldots, 10 \).

Case 2 - Longest side length is \( k \):** For \( k \ge 15 \),
- By the triangle inequality, \( k < 15 + 11 \), which simplifies to \( k < 26 \).
- For the triangle to be obtuse, \( k^2 > 11^2 + 15^2 \), simplifying to \( k^2 > 346 \). Since \( k \) is an integer, \( k \ge 19 \).
Combining these, the valid values of \( k \) in this case are \( 19, 20, \ldots, 25 \).

The total number of possible values for \( k \) is the sum of the number of values in each case.
- In Case 1, \( k = 5, 6, \ldots, 10 \) gives 6 values (since \( 10 - 5 + 1 = 6 \)).
- In Case 2, \( k = 19, 20, \ldots, 25 \) gives 7 values (since \( 25 - 19 + 1 = 7 \)).
Therefore, the total number of possible values for \( k \) is \( 6 + 7 = 13 \).
So, the total values are \( \boxed{13} \)



Correct Answer:
#There are mistakes in the proposed solution. Here is a valid one:
Amy's Cylinder:
- Height \( h_A = 8 \) inches.
- Base circumference is \( 2\pi r_A = 6 \) inches, so the radius \( r_A = \frac{3}{\pi} \) inches.
- Volume \( V_A = \pi r_A^2 h_A = \pi \left(\frac{3}{\pi}\right)^2 \times 8 = \frac{72}{\pi} \) cubic inches.

Belinda's Cylinder:
- Height \( h_B = 6 \) inches.
- Base circumference is \( 2\pi r_B = 8 \) inches, so the radius \( r_B = \frac{4}{\pi} \) inches.
- Volume \( V_B = \pi r_B^2 h_B = \pi \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^2 \times 6 = \frac{96}{\pi} \) cubic inches.

The positive difference \( |V_B - V_A| = \left|\frac{96}{\pi} - \frac{72}{\pi}\right| = \frac{24}{\pi} \) cubic inches.
Multiplying by \( \pi \), we get \( \pi \times \frac{24}{\pi} = 24 \) cubic inches.
Therefore, \( \pi \) times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes is \( \boxed{24} \).
