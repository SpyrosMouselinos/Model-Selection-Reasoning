Let's check if the following problem-answer pairs are correct. Think step by step. Here are examples how to do it.

Question: A delicious circular pie with a diameter of $12\\text{cm}$ is cut into three equal-sized sector-shaped pieces. Let $l$ be the number of centimeters in the length of the longest line segment that may be drawn in one of these pieces. What is $l^2$?

Proposed Answer:
To solve this problem, we need to first visualize the pie and the sector-shaped pieces created when it's cut into three equal parts. Each sector will have a central angle of \( \frac{360^\circ}{3} = 120^\circ \). The diameter of the pie is \( 12 \) cm, so its radius (r) is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) cm.
The longest line segment that can be drawn in one of these sector-shaped pieces will be the line segment that connects the tip of the sector (at the center of the pie) to a point on the curved edge of the sector. This line segment will be a radius of the pie, which is \( 6 \) cm.
Therefore, \( l = 6 \) cm.
To find \( l^2 \), we simply square \( l \). So, \( l^2 = 6^2 = 36 \).
The answer is \\boxed{36}.

Correct Answer:
We draw one sector and label the center of the circle as O, the endpoints of the radius forming the sector as A and B, and the midpoint of the arc AB as C. The longest segment in the sector is AB.
By drawing the perpendicular bisector from O to AB, we divide the line segment AB into two equal parts at point M. This creates two right triangles, MOA and MOB.
The angle AOB is a third of a full circle (360°), so it's 120°. Since OM bisects AOB, each of angles MOA and MOB is 60°. Therefore, MOB (and MOA) is a 30-60-90 right triangle.
In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratios of the sides opposite these angles are 1:sqrt(3):2. Here, OB is the hypotenuse and equals half the diameter of the pie, which is 6 cm. Therefore, OM (opposite the 30° angle) is half of OB, so OM = 3 cm. MB (opposite the 60° angle) is √3 times OM, so MB = 3sqrt(3) cm.
Since AB is twice MB (as M is the midpoint), AB = 2 × MB = 2 × 3sqrt(3) = 6sqrt(3) cm.
Finally, we square this length to find \( l^2 \), which is \( (6\sqrt{3})^2 = 36 \times 3 = 108 \).
Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{108}.


Now it's your turn. Here is another problem:
Question: Amy and Belinda each roll a sheet of 6-inch by 8-inch paper to form a cylindrical tube. Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together without overlap. Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together without overlap. What is $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes?
Proposed Answer:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volumes of the two cylindrical tubes formed by Amy and Belinda and then find the positive difference between these volumes multiplied by \( \pi \).
Amy's Cylinder:
- Amy rolls the paper along the 8-inch sides, forming a cylinder with a height of 8 inches and a radius of half the 6-inch side (since the circumference of the base of the cylinder is the length of the paper).
- Radius \( r_A = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) inches.
- Height \( h_A = 8 \) inches.
- Volume \( V_A = \pi r_A^2 h_A = \pi \times 3^2 \times 8 \).
Belinda's Cylinder:
- Belinda rolls the paper along the 6-inch sides, forming a cylinder with a height of 6 inches and a radius of half the 8-inch side.
- Radius \( r_B = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) inches.
- Height \( h_B = 6 \) inches.
- Volume \( V_B = \pi r_B^2 h_B = \pi \times 4^2 \times 6 \).
The positive difference in volumes \( |V_B - V_A| \).
We need to calculate \( \pi \times |V_B - V_A| \).
The value of \( \pi \) times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes formed by Amy and Belinda is approximately \\boxed{236.87}.



Question:  In a 5 by 5 grid, each of the 25 small squares measures 2 cm by 2 cm and is shaded. Five unshaded circles are then placed on top of the grid as shown. The area of the visible shaded region can be written in the form $A-B\\pi$ square cm. What is the value $A+B$?\n\n[asy]\nfor(int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n\nfor(int j = 0; j < 5; ++j)\n\n{\n\nfilldraw((i,j)--(i+1,j)--(i+1,j+1)--(i,j+1)--(i,j)--cycle,gray,linewidth(2));\n\n}\n}\n\nfilldraw(circle((2.5,.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\nfilldraw(circle((4.5,2.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\nfilldraw(circle((2.5,4.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\nfilldraw(circle((.5,2.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\n\nfilldraw(circle((2.5,2.5),1.5),white,linewidth(2));\n[/asy]
Proposed Answer:
Total Area of the Grid:
- Each side of the grid measures \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) cm, so the total area of the grid is \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) square cm.
Area of the Four Smaller Circles:
- The diameter of each smaller circle is equal to the side of a small square, which is 2 cm. Thus, the radius of each smaller circle is 1 cm.
- The total area of the four smaller circles is \( 4 \times \pi \times 1^2 = 4\pi \) square cm.
Area of the Large Circle:
- The diameter of the large circle is equal to the length of three sides of a small square, which is 6 cm. Thus, the radius of the large circle is 3 cm.
- The area of the large circle is \( \pi \times 3^2 = 9\pi \) square cm.
Area of the Visible Shaded Region:
- The area of the visible shaded region is the area of the grid minus the area of the five circles.
- So, the area is \( 100 - 4\pi - 9\pi = 100 - 13\pi \) square cm.
Given that \( A = 100 \) and \( B = 13 \), the value of \( A+B \) is \( 100 + 13 = \boxed{113} \).



Question: Two cross sections of a right hexagonal pyramid are obtained by cutting the pyramid with planes parallel to the hexagonal base. The areas of the cross sections are $216\\sqrt{3}$ square feet and $486\\sqrt{3}$ square feet. The two planes are $8$ feet apart. How far from the apex of the pyramid is the larger cross section, in feet?
Proposed Answer:
- The ratio of the areas of the two cross sections is \( \frac{216\sqrt{3}}{486\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4}{9} \).
- Since the ratio of the area of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides, the ratio of the corresponding sides of the cross-sections is \( \sqrt{\frac{4}{9}} = \frac{2}{3} \).
- Consider the right triangles formed by the apex of the pyramid, the foot of the altitude from the apex to each cross section, and a vertex of the hexagon on the cross-section. These two right triangles are similar.
- The ratio of the legs of these triangles in the cross-section is \( \frac{2}{3} \), so the heights of the right triangles are in the same ratio.
Calculating the Distance of the Larger Cross Section from the Apex:
- Let the distance from the apex to the larger cross section be \( h \) feet. 
- The distance from the apex to the smaller cross section is \( \frac{2}{3}h \) feet.
- Since the two planes are 8 feet apart, we have \( h - \frac{2}{3}h = 8 \).
Solving for \( h \):
- \( \frac{1}{3}h = 8 \)
- \( h = 24 \) feet.
Therefore, the larger cross section is \( \boxed{24} \) feet away from the apex of the pyramid.



Question: Right $\\triangle ABC$ has $AB=3$, $BC=4$, and $AC=5$.  Square $XYZW$ is inscribed in $\\triangle ABC$ with $X$ and $Y$ on $\\overline{AC}$, $W$ on $\\overline{AB}$, and $Z$ on $\\overline{BC}$.  What is the side length of the square?\n\n[asy]\npair A,B,C,W,X,Y,Z;\nA=(-9,0); B=(0,12); C=(16,0);\nW=(12A+25B)/37;\nZ =(12C+25B)/37;\nX=foot(W,A,C);\nY=foot(Z,A,C);\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\ndraw(X--W--Z--Y);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,SW);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,N);\nlabel(\"$C$\",C,E);\nlabel(\"$W$\",W,NW);\nlabel(\"$X$\",X,S);\nlabel(\"$Y$\",Y,S);\nlabel(\"$Z$\",Z,NE);\n[/asy],
Proposed Answer:
To solve for the side length of square \( XYZW \) inscribed in right triangle \( ABC \), we can use the properties of similar triangles and the fact that the square is inscribed in the triangle.
Let the side length of square \( XYZW \) be \( s \).
Observe that triangles \( AWX \) and \( ABC \) are similar (both are right triangles, and they share angle \( A \)).
Similarly, triangles \( ZCB \) and \( ABC \) are similar.
From the similarity of triangles \( AWX \) and \( ABC \), the ratio of the sides opposite angle \( A \) (i.e., \( WX \) and \( BC \)) is equal to the ratio of the sides adjacent to angle \( A \) (i.e., \( AW \) and \( AC \)).
From the similarity of triangles \( ZCB \) and \( ABC \), the ratio of the sides opposite angle \( B \) (i.e., \( ZC \) and \( AB \)) is equal to the ratio of the sides adjacent to angle \( B \) (i.e., \( ZB \) and \( BC \)).
\( \frac{s}{4} = \frac{AC - s}{5} \) from triangle \( AWX \).
\( \frac{s}{3} = \frac{BC - s}{4} \) from triangle \( ZCB \).
From the first proportion, \( s = \frac{4(5 - s)}{5} \).
From the second proportion, \( s = \frac{3(4 - s)}{4} \).
Solve \( \frac{4(5 - s)}{5} = \frac{3(4 - s)}{4} \) for \( s \).
From the similarity of triangles \( AWX \) and \( ABC \):
\( \frac{s}{4} = \frac{5 - s}{5} \)
From the similarity of triangles \( ZCB \) and \( ABC \):
\( \frac{s}{3} = \frac{4 - s}{4} \)
The side length of the square \( XYZW \) inscribed in the right triangle \( ABC \) is approximately \( 2.22 \) feet, or \\boxed{\frac{111}{50}}.

Correct Answer:
#There are mistakes in the proposed solution. Here is a valid one:
Amy's Cylinder:
- Height \( h_A = 8 \) inches.
- Base circumference is \( 2\pi r_A = 6 \) inches, so the radius \( r_A = \frac{3}{\pi} \) inches.
- Volume \( V_A = \pi r_A^2 h_A = \pi \left(\frac{3}{\pi}\right)^2 \times 8 = \frac{72}{\pi} \) cubic inches.
Belinda's Cylinder:
- Height \( h_B = 6 \) inches.
- Base circumference is \( 2\pi r_B = 8 \) inches, so the radius \( r_B = \frac{4}{\pi} \) inches.
- Volume \( V_B = \pi r_B^2 h_B = \pi \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^2 \times 6 = \frac{96}{\pi} \) cubic inches.
The positive difference \( |V_B - V_A| = \left|\frac{96}{\pi} - \frac{72}{\pi}\right| = \frac{24}{\pi} \) cubic inches.
Multiplying by \( \pi \), we get \( \pi \times \frac{24}{\pi} = 24 \) cubic inches.
Therefore, \( \pi \) times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes is \( \boxed{24} \).

#There are mistakes in the proposed solution. Here is a valid one:
To find the side length of the square inscribed in right triangle ABC using Approach 1:
Determine the Altitude \( h \):
- The altitude \( h \) from point B in right triangle ABC (with sides 3, 4, and 5) is calculated as \( h = \frac{3 \times 4}{5} = \frac{12}{5} \).
Relation Between \( s \) and \( h \):
- Since triangles ABC and WBZ are similar, we have the relationship \( \frac{h-s}{s} = \frac{h}{AC} = \frac{h}{5} \).
- Solving for \( s \), we get \( s = \frac{5h}{5 + h} \).
Calculate \( s \):
- Substitute \( h = \frac{12}{5} \) into the equation for \( s \):
 \[ s = \frac{5 \times \frac{12}{5}}{5 + \frac{12}{5}} = \frac{60}{37} \]
Therefore, the side length of the square \( s \) is \( \boxed{\frac{60}{37}} \).
