Think step by step.
Examples:
Question: Amy and Belinda each roll a sheet of 6-inch by 8-inch paper to form a cylindrical tube.
Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together without overlap.
Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together without overlap.
What is $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes?

Proposed Answer:
We need to calculate the volumes of tubes:
Amy forms a cylinder with a height of 8 inches and a radius of half the 6-inch side.
Radius \( r_A = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) inches. Height \( h_A = 8 \) inches. Volume \( V_A = \pi r_A^2 h_A = \pi \times 3^2 \times 8 \).
Belinda forms a cylinder with a height of 6 inches and a radius of half the 8-inch side.
Radius \( r_B = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) inches. Height \( h_B = 6 \) inches. Volume \( V_B = \pi r_B^2 h_B = \pi \times 4^2 \times 6 \).
The value of \( \pi \) times the positive difference is approximately 236.
\\boxed{236.87}.

Correct Answer:
#There are mistakes in the proposed solution. Here is a valid one:
Amy's Cylinder:
Base circumference is \( 2\pi r_A = 6 \) inches, so the radius \( r_A = \frac{3}{\pi} \) inches.
Volume \( V_A = \pi r_A^2 h_A = \pi \left(\frac{3}{\pi}\right)^2 \times 8 = \frac{72}{\pi} \) cubic inches.
Belinda's Cylinder:
Height \( h_B = 6 \) inches. Base circumference is \( 2\pi r_B = 8 \) inches, so the radius \( r_B = \frac{4}{\pi} \) inches. Volume \( V_B = \pi r_B^2 h_B = \pi \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^2 \times 6 = \frac{96}{\pi} \) cubic inches.
The positive difference \( |V_B - V_A| = \left|\frac{96}{\pi} - \frac{72}{\pi}\right| = \frac{24}{\pi} \) cubic inches.
Therefore, \pi times is 24.
\\boxed{24}.

Question:  In a 5 by 5 grid, each of the 25 small squares measures 2 cm by 2 cm and is shaded.
Five unshaded circles are then placed on top of the grid as shown. 
The area of the visible shaded region can be written in the form $A-B\\pi$ square cm.
What is the value $A+B$?

Proposed Answer:
The total area is 100 square cm. The diameter of each smaller circle is equal to the side of a small square, which is 2 cm.
The radius of each smaller circle is 1 cm. The total area of the four smaller circles is \( 4 \times \pi \times 1^2 = 4\pi \) square cm.
The diameter of the large circle is equal to the length of three sides of a small square, which is 6 cm.
Thus, the radius of the large circle is 3 cm. The area of the large circle is \( \pi \times 3^2 = 9\pi \) square cm.
The area of the visible shaded region is the area of the grid minus the area of the five circles.
So, the area is \( 100 - 4\pi - 9\pi = 100 - 13\pi \) square cm.
Given that \( A = 100 \) and \( B = 13 \), the value of \( A+B \) is 113.
\\boxed{113}.

Correct Answer:
#The answer is correct. Lets return it once again:
\\boxed{113}
