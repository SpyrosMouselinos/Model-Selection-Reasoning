Question: A delicious circular pie with a diameter of $12\\text{cm}$ is cut into three equal-sized sector-shaped pieces. Let $l$ be the number of centimeters in the length of the longest line segment that may be drawn in one of these pieces. What is $l^2$?

Proposed Answer:
Visualize the pie and the sector-shaped pieces created when it's cut into three equal parts.
Each sector will have a central angle of \( \frac{360^\circ}{3} = 120^\circ \).
The diameter of the pie is \( 12 \) cm, so its radius (r) is \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) cm.
The longest line segment that can be drawn in one of these sector-shaped pieces will be the line segment that connects the tip of the sector (at the center of the pie) to a point on the curved edge of the sector. This line segment will be a radius of the pie, which is \( 6 \) cm.
Therefore, l = 6 cm. To find l^2, we square l.
The answer is \\boxed{36}.

Correct Answer:
We draw one sector and label the center of the circle as O, the endpoints of the radius forming the sector as A and B, and the midpoint of the arc AB as C.
The longest segment in the sector is AB. By drawing the perpendicular bisector from O to AB, we divide the line segment AB into two equal parts at point M. This creates two right triangles, MOA and MOB.
The angle AOB is a third of a full circle so it's 120°.
 Since OM bisects AOB, each of angles MOA and MOB is 60°. Therefore, MOB (and MOA) is a 30-60-90 right triangle.
In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratios of the sides opposite these angles are 1:sqrt(3):2.
Here, OB is the hypotenuse and equals half the diameter of the pie, which is 6 cm.
Therefore, OM (opposite the 30° angle) is half of OB, so OM = 3 cm.
MB (opposite the 60° angle) is √3 times OM, so MB = 3sqrt(3) cm.
Since AB is twice MB (as M is the midpoint), AB = 2 × MB = 2 × 3sqrt(3) = 6sqrt(3) cm.
Finally, we square this length to find l^2, which is (6\sqrt{3})^2 = 36 \\times 3 = 108.
Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{108}.

Now it's your turn. Here is another problem:

Question: Amy and Belinda each roll a sheet of 6-inch by 8-inch paper to form a cylindrical tube. Amy tapes the two 8-inch sides together without overlap. Belinda tapes the two 6-inch sides together without overlap. What is $\\pi$ times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes?

Proposed Answer:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volumes of the two cylindrical tubes formed by Amy and Belinda and then find the positive difference between these volumes multiplied by \( \pi \).
Amy's Cylinder:
- Amy rolls the paper along the 8-inch sides, forming a cylinder with a height of 8 inches and a radius of half the 6-inch side (since the circumference of the base of the cylinder is the length of the paper).
- Radius \( r_A = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) inches.
- Height \( h_A = 8 \) inches.
- Volume \( V_A = \pi r_A^2 h_A = \pi \times 3^2 \times 8 \).
Belinda's Cylinder:
- Belinda rolls the paper along the 6-inch sides, forming a cylinder with a height of 6 inches and a radius of half the 8-inch side.
- Radius \( r_B = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) inches.
- Height \( h_B = 6 \) inches.
- Volume \( V_B = \pi r_B^2 h_B = \pi \times 4^2 \times 6 \).
The positive difference in volumes \( |V_B - V_A| \).
We need to calculate \( \pi \times |V_B - V_A| \).
The value of \( \pi \) times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes formed by Amy and Belinda is approximately \\boxed{236.87}.

Correct Answer:
#There are mistakes in the proposed solution. Here is a valid one:
Amy's Cylinder:
Height h_A = 8 inches.
- Base circumference is \( 2\pi r_A = 6 \) inches, so the radius \( r_A = \frac{3}{\pi} \) inches.
- Volume \( V_A = \pi r_A^2 h_A = \pi \left(\frac{3}{\pi}\right)^2 \times 8 = \frac{72}{\pi} \) cubic inches.
Belinda's Cylinder:
- Height \( h_B = 6 \) inches.
- Base circumference is \( 2\pi r_B = 8 \) inches, so the radius \( r_B = \frac{4}{\pi} \) inches.
- Volume \( V_B = \pi r_B^2 h_B = \pi \left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^2 \times 6 = \frac{96}{\pi} \) cubic inches.
The positive difference \( |V_B - V_A| = \left|\frac{96}{\pi} - \frac{72}{\pi}\right| = \frac{24}{\pi} \) cubic inches.
Multiplying by \( \pi \), we get \( \pi \times \frac{24}{\pi} = 24 \) cubic inches.
Therefore, \( \pi \) times the positive difference of the volumes of the two tubes is \( \\boxed{24} \).

Question:  In a 5 by 5 grid, each of the 25 small squares measures 2 cm by 2 cm and is shaded. Five unshaded circles are then placed on top of the grid as shown. The area of the visible shaded region can be written in the form $A-B\\pi$ square cm. What is the value $A+B$?\n\n[asy]\nfor(int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)\n{\n\nfor(int j = 0; j < 5; ++j)\n\n{\n\nfilldraw((i,j)--(i+1,j)--(i+1,j+1)--(i,j+1)--(i,j)--cycle,gray,linewidth(2));\n\n}\n}\n\nfilldraw(circle((2.5,.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\nfilldraw(circle((4.5,2.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\nfilldraw(circle((2.5,4.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\nfilldraw(circle((.5,2.5),.5),white,linewidth(2));\n\nfilldraw(circle((2.5,2.5),1.5),white,linewidth(2));\n[/asy]
Proposed Answer:
Each side of the grid measures \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) cm, so the total area is 100 square cm.
The diameter of each smaller circle is equal to the side of a small square, which is 2 cm.
Thus, the radius of each smaller circle is 1 cm. The total area of the four smaller circles is \( 4 \times \pi \times 1^2 = 4\pi \) square cm.
The diameter of the large circle is equal to the length of three sides of a small square, which is 6 cm.
Thus, the radius of the large circle is 3 cm. The area of the large circle is \( \pi \times 3^2 = 9\pi \) square cm.
The area of the visible shaded region is the area of the grid minus the area of the five circles.
So, the area is \( 100 - 4\pi - 9\pi = 100 - 13\pi \) square cm.
Given that \( A = 100 \) and \( B = 13 \), the value of \( A+B \) is \( 100 + 13 = \\boxed{113} \).

\\boxed{113}
